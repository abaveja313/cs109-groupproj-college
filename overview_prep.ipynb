Our team at Harvard's Data Science Class has analyzed more than 13,000 applications to determine which factors matter most to the top twenty-five colleges in the USA. We have also built an [online predictor](http://www.chanceme.info/) that lets a student or parent enter current results, see the chances of getting into an elite college. Even more importantly, the student can then change the values to see if time is better spent improving grades or playing more varsity sports.\n",
