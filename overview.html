      <p class="lead">It is college application season.</p>

      <p>Across the country four million students will be
      submitting upwards of forty million applications (<a href=
      "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/16/nyregion/applications-by-the-dozen-as-anxious-students-hedge-college-bets.html">source</a>)
      and then fretting until late March to find the results. Our
      team at Harvard's Data Science Class has analyzed more than
      13,000 applications to determine which factors matter most to
      the top twenty-five colleges in the USA. We have also built
      an <a href="http://www.chanceme.info/">online predictor</a>
      that lets a student or parent enter current results, see the
      chances of getting into an elite college. Even more
      importantly, the student can then change the values to see if
      time is better spent improving grades or playing more varsity
      sports.</p>

      <p>Let's see how one student Morgan, a math-savvy junior, can
      use <a href="http://www.chanceme.info/">our website</a> to
      decide where to spend her time.</p>

      <h3>Which Factors are Most Important </h3>

      <p>Standardized tests, GPA and the school the student is applying are the most important factors by far that determine admission success. This should come as no surprise. What is surprising is how little other factors matter. Sports can be [a huge time sink](http://collegepuzzle.stanford.edu/?p=2088) yet make no difference to a successful admission. Unless the student is a star recruited athlete, a fraction of the time spent on sports would be better spent improving standardized tests, especially the SAT or ACT score. </p>
    
<p>Having Legacy which many parents count on and many students wish for turns out not to be as important better AP exams or SAT subject tests. </p>
