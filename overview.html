      <p class="lead">It is college application season.</p>

      <p>Across the country four million students will be
      submitting upwards of forty million applications (<a href=
      "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/16/nyregion/applications-by-the-dozen-as-anxious-students-hedge-college-bets.html">source</a>)
      and then fretting until late March to find the results. Our
      team at Harvard's Data Science Class has analyzed more than
      13,000 applications to determine which factors matter most to
      the top twenty-five colleges in the USA. We have also built
      an <a href="http://www.chanceme.info/">online predictor</a>
      that lets a student or parent enter current results, see the
      chances of getting into an elite college. Even more
      importantly, the student can then change the values to see if
      time is better spent improving grades or playing more varsity
      sports.</p>

      <p>Let's see how one student Morgan, a math-savvy junior, can
      use <a href="http://www.chanceme.info/">our website</a> to
      decide where to spend her time.</p>

      <h3>Which Factors are Most Important</h3>

  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-6 col-md-offset-3">
      <p>Standardized tests, GPA and the school the student is
      applying are the most important factors by far that determine
      admission success. This should come as no surprise. What is
      surprising is how little other factors matter. Sports can be
      <a href="http://collegepuzzle.stanford.edu/?p=2088">
      a huge time sink</a>
      yet make no difference to a successful admission. Unless the
      student is a star recruited athlete, a fraction of the time
      spent on sports would be better spent improving standardized
      tests, especially the SAT or ACT score.</p>

      <h3>Diversity and Underrepresented Minorities</h3>

  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-6 col-md-offset-3">
      <p>Being an underrepresented minority (Hispanic,
      African-American, Native American) provides an average boost
      to the candidate's SAT or ACT by 87 points. This can make a
      huge difference when the schools are so competitive. However,
      this advantage varies significantly by school. Carnegie
      Mellon gives the greatest boost to minorities, with an
      average increase of 149 points. Harvard is notably the only
      of the top twenty-five that has statistically no premium
      given to underrepresented minorities.</p>

      <h3>Truly Needs Blind?</h3>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-6 col-md-offset-3">
      <p>Most of these elite schools claim to be "needs blind."
      Their admission decision is not supposed to factor in the
      ability of the candidate to pay. Our analysis showed this
      indeed to be the case: whether or not the candidate needed
      financial assistance had no affect on the acceptance
      decision. <strong>The acceptance rates, when all other
      factors were accounted for, remained the same irrespective of
      whether the student was able to pay full tuition or
      not.</strong></p>

      <h3>Private Schools</h3>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-6 col-md-offset-3">
      <p>Are private schools worth the addition price? Some private
      schools have annual tuition as much as college although for
      twelve years instead of four. For example, $30,000 per year
      invested at 5% over 12 years means cumulative cost of almost
      half a million dollars.</p>

      <p>As you can see in the following chart, students at private
      schools have an advantage in the most critical aspects for
      college admissions. The differences appear slight, but when
      twenty points in SAT score can make the difference between
      acceptance and rejection, the results are pronounced.</p>
