It is college application season. Across the country four million students will be submitting upwards of forty million 
applications (<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/16/nyregion/applications-by-the-dozen-as-anxious-students-hedge-college-bets.html">source</a>)
 and then fretting until late March to find the results. Our team at Harvard's Data Science Class has analyzed more than 13,000 
applications to determine which factors matter most to the top twenty-five colleges in the USA. 

We have also built an <a href="http://www.chanceme.info/">online predictor</a> that lets a student or parent enter current 
results, see the chances of getting into an elite college. Even more importantly, the student can then change the values to 
see if time is better spent improving grades or playing more varsity sports.
