    "The code for the webservice can be found in the ./webservice subdirectory. This is a copy of the code running in production. The reference origin git repo is *not* in this repository. It is hosted on [OpenShift](https://www.openshift.com/). Ask if you want access to the production git repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How the Webservice Works\n",
    "\n",
    "The webservice is a minimal [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) application used to provide prediction probabilities for a given candidate. There is one useful entry point: `/predict` that expects the user's admissionTest, AP, etc on the query string. It will return a JSON file consisting of the probabilities of getting into each college.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sample input:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "http://mypythonapp-wihl.rhcloud.com/predict?admissionstest=0.926899206&AP=7&averageAP=1.06733864&SATsubject=0.324271565&GPA=-0.187109979&schooltype=0&intendedgradyear=2017&female=1&MinorityRace=0&international=0&sports=0&earlyAppl=0&alumni=0&outofstate=0&acceptrate=0.151&size=6621&public=0&finAidPct=0&instatePct=0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Sample output:\n",
    "```\n",
    "{\n",
    "  \"preds\": [\n",
    "    {\n",
    "      \"college\": \"Princeton\",\n",
    "      \"prob\": 0.26166666666666666\n",
    "    },\n",
    "    {\n",
    "      \"college\": \"Harvard\",\n",
    "      \"prob\": 0.23999999999999999\n",
    "    },\n",

    "      \"prob\": 0.23999999999999999\n",
    "    },\n",
    "    ...\n",
    " ]\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Webservice startup\n",
    "\n",
    "Upon getting the first `/predict` request, the web service will perform the same logic as the classification iPython notebook. It loads the normalized college data, imputes missing values, and runs Scikit-Learn's Random Forest classification. The resulting classifier is kept in memory as a Python global variable to service subsequent prediction requests. There is no locking at the present time. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Webservice Dependencies\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the webservice is running the full Pandas and Scikit-Learn stacks, these had to installed on the OpenShift cartridge. Here's what was done:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create an OpenShift account\n",
    "1. Install the [client tools](https://developers.openshift.com/en/managing-client-tools.html). This will install `rhc`, the necessary local command line tool for managing OpenShift apps.\n",
    "1. Use the Flask Quickstart template ([details](https://developers.openshift.com/en/python-flask.html))\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    rhc app create myflaskapp python-2.7 --from-code=https://github.com/openshift-quickstart/flask-base.git\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "1. This will create a local myflaskapp git repository. Go into this repository: `cd myflaskapp`\n",
    "1. SSH into the app and install the dependent packages:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    rhc ssh myflaskapp\n",
    "    source ~/python/virtenv/activate\n",
    "    pip install numpy\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    The `pip install` has to be repeated for `scipy, pandas` and `scikit-learn`. This takes a while as it is compiled     locally on the OpenShift instance and may not have optimal performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. After all the packages have been installed, take the output of `pip freeze` and update the `requirements.txt` in the *local* repository.\n",
    "1. At this point, you can grab the appropriate files from `./webservice` directory, notably: `TIdatabase.py, collegelist.csv, collegedata_normalized.csv, flaskapp.py`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Programming Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the Quickstart template, the real work is done in `flaskapp.py`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Logging is off by default. To log errors from your app, use:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "import logging\n",
    "\n",
    "logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG,format='%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We simply used global variables to stored information. It is also possible to use the [appcontext](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.10/appcontext/). \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the app can be tested locally very easily. From a local shell use: `python flaskapp.py`. It will say which address / port it is listening on when starting up.\n",
    "\n",
    "### DevOps Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "To see the logs, use `rhc tail -o '-n 100' mypythonapp`\n",
    "\n",
    "Common rhc commands can be found [here](https://developers.openshift.com/en/managing-common-rhc-commands.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Consuming the Webservice from R\n",
    "\n",
    "Sample code to consume the webservice can be found in `rclient.R`. This simulates how the production Shiny app can invoke the webservice. An R data.frame is created with the normalized user inputted values. This is used to populate the query string of the webservice. Note that the webservice ignores the last five variables, which are specific to a given college, since probabilities for *all* colleges are returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "The returned JSON is easily parsed into an R data.frame for presentation to the user or further manipulation. Here is a snippet:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "# create query string\n",
    "qs = paste0(colnames(pred),\"=\",pred[1,],collapse=\"&\")\n",
    "server = \"http://127.0.0.1:5000/predict\"\n",
    "server = \"http://mypythonapp-wihl.rhcloud.com/predict\"\n",
    "\n",
    "URL = paste0(server,\"?\",qs)\n",
    "\n",
    "js  = fromJSON(URL)\n",
    "df = js$preds\n",
    "df$college = as.factor(df$college)\n",
    "summary(df)\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
