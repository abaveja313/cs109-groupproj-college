    "### Data Sources We Partially Used\n",
    "\n",
    "We started by [scraping 30,000 messages in 1,000 threads](https://github.com/wihl/cs109-groupproj-college/tree/master/scrape/collegeconfidential) from [College Confidential](http://www.collegeconfidential.com/). However, this dataset was not as useful for predictions as the Collegedata Admissions Tracker. We may revisit this in the future for textual analysis of the threads. \n",

    "We explored many different potential sources of predicting college admissions. Interestingly, for a multi-billion dollar market with many 'experts' advising students and parents, there is surprisingly little research into what factors actually make a significant difference to admission candidates. These were the best articles we could find and they are only tangentially useful.\n",
