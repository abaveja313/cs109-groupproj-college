I was admitted off the waitlist. I was accepted to EVERY school I applied to including all the UC's, CSUSM, and SDSU.\n\nLook through the posts in that thread. People said that I shouldn't even bother applying to certain colleges because I wasn't good enough. One thing I regret about college applications is the fact that I let the people on the College Confidential forum get to me and lower my self worth. They made me feel worthless, like I wouldn't even be accepted to a CSU(if you look through my other threads). I actually went through a period of depression because I didn't think any school would want me and it affected my grades.\n\nBut look at me now, a proud Bruin! One thing I have to say to all you college applicants: You guys don't give yourself enough credit for all your hard work. I know because I didn't at first. Please remember that you are a superb student, and do NOT let others define you. This is a lesson learned in time, but you all will understand eventually!
