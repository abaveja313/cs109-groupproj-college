autistic adults special effects computer animation and web design to prepare them for studio employment I teach adobe flash dreamweaver and photoshop This is a copy of my personal statement Growing up I had to cope with rude comments staring eyes and peoplea s whispers that others thought I couldn t hear Initially it bothered me a little not because I necessarily cared about their opinion but because I thought it was unfair to criticize make remarks about people one hardly knows especially when that person is the one human being I love the most and care for unconditionally My one year old brother was diagnosed with autism on the eve of my fifth birthday I didna t fully realize what that diagnosis entailed and even less did I know that it would come to shape me into who I am as a person in the future My brother Aram had therapy six days a week right after school until late in the afternoon I would watch him struggle with concepts that were too complex for him and try answering questions he hardly comprehended As school grew more difficult and I became frustrated with my studies Aram was always on my mind How could I give up when I have such an advantage over him and he keeps trying When I failed at anything my parents were always gracious enough to remind me that I was capable of much better When I didn t want to do my homework or practice piano I would walk into the next room to see him struggling over the concepts of a morea and a lessa or a strangersa and a familya He inspires me to never take anything I have for granted His autism exposed me to a world of people with disabilities I would go to parent meetings and events dedicated to families of people who shared in this struggle I became acquainted with children who have severe social issues it brought me joy to a make their daya by talking and playing with them or even waving and smiling I befriended the immobile nonverbal and aggressive alike and came to see people for everything that they were and not how they spoke or looked or behaved By the time I was in middle school I was deeply involved with that world In middle school I attended 2 years of animation class where I learned how to design characters make storyboards and use Adobe Flash to animate then Maya to animate in 3 D After middle school a family friend and past President of the Foothill Autism Alliance told my mom about Media Enrichment Academy MEA an organization that specialized in teaching children with autism to animate She called and asked if we would be interested in enrolling my brother or if I was interested in learning more since I knew animation I visited and later volunteered there I became a weekly volunteer for a year and a half It was very gratifying helping others like my brother and to have their families be so thankful I was helping their children do something productive with their lives Soon the company broke into two and I began volunteering during the summer for Exceptional Minds where adults with autism would attend after high school so that they could learn the skills they needed to get jobs in the future I became and still am very passionate about this organization because I feel like it gives hope to people like my brother and I feel I am actually making a difference in the world It is my greatest hope that my brother could be capable enough to somehow make it in this world and to be able to be as much a functioning member of society as anyone else After two summers of volunteering every day I was offered a job there ita s almost a dream job to me I know the students are always happy to see me and I very pleased that I can make them feel comfortable even if normally theya re very self conscious of the fact that they are different I thank my brother every day for making me into a better more accepting person and for teaching me more about life than I could teach him ,1.0,1.0,-1.0,1.0,-1.0,,-1.0,,
