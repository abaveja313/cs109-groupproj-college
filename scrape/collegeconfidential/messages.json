I was admitted off the waitlist. I was accepted to EVERY school I applied to including all the UC's, CSUSM, and SDSU.\n\nLook through the posts in that thread. People said that I shouldn't even bother applying to certain colleges because I wasn't good enough. One thing I regret about college applications is the fact that I let the people on the College Confidential forum get to me and lower my self worth. They made me feel worthless, like I wouldn't even be accepted to a CSU(if you look through my other threads). I actually went through a period of depression because I didn't think any school would want me and it affected my grades.\n\nBut look at me now, a proud Bruin! One thing I have to say to all you college applicants: You guys don't give yourself enough credit for all your hard work. I know because I didn't at first. Please remember that you are a superb student, and do NOT let others define you. This is a lesson learned in time, but you all will understand eventually!

I think I applied as an Anthropology/ Cultural Studies Major\n\nWilliams- Knowing what I know now this would have been my first choice at the beginning, they have a great squash coach/team, and excellent academics obviously. I was rejected and I applied as anthro/cultural studies\n\n'Reach Schools' (read: I think i worked hard enough to get in, but it didnt happen for me):\nUC Berkeley- I was rejected initially and on appeal, I'm a decent writer, and I thought my letter appealing my rejection projected honesty and dedication, without complaining, but it didnt work out.\n\nHaverford College- Knowing what I know now, this is the place I wish I was going next year, more than Columbia or Williams, more than Berkeley. The squash coach and the people on the squash team are really cool. I did everything i could just to get on the waitlist (using a family connection, meeting the squash coach, visiting the campus, etc), yesterday i received mail telling me they didnt have any space, im so disappointed and kind of defeated because I really tried to get in here.\n\nUCLA- I didnt want to go to UCLA, way too close to home, but ill put it here because it qualifies, I was rejected, and im a little upset because other people at my high school go in who I felt were less qualified. However, I would not go to UCLA even had I been accepted, so good call from them to not accept me.\n\nUSC- read UCLA, same deal, other less qualified (imo) people at my school were accepted.\n\nUCSD- I didnt really think of this as a reach school, i honestly thought I was assured acceptance, but I was offered the waitlist, whcih i passed on because San Diego is in SoCal, and I visited it and its kind of lame.\n\nSafety Schools (I got accepted at these schools, and I knew I would):\n\nUC Merced- surprise surprise\nUC Riverside-see merced\nUCSB-  too many frat boys sorority girls, could have been fun, but not really my thing\nUC Davis- Lovely campus, the nicest of the UC's, I visited and the town is really weak. I think i would only survive frosh year because thats the year you live on campus.\nUC Irvine- ew, this school will ruin your life seriously, its like going back to high school, i know soooooo many people going there and i just smh and smile at them and tell them theyll have a great time, who am i to step on their dreams?\nUC Santa Cruz- very beautiful campus, has all the great student housing options that Santa Barbara has, but with hippies (I like hippies) instead of  the bro's. This is most where Im registered at, though I still have some time to decide on...\n\nUniversity of Oregon- i have till the 23rd of may to make up my mind, and i will probably visit on the 22nd. I hear conflicting things (hopefully someone can clarify): some people say U of O is on the up and up, buying good professors and recruiting good students. Others say its really not that great and that its 111th ranking in US News/world report says it all.\n\nSummary: I am deciding between Santa Cruz which I like, and Oregon which I also like (no visit yet though), at both I would be looking to try to transfer somewhere else after frosh. Im just not satisfied with either. Major worries for santa cruz are that ill become a complacent slacker (you saw my grades, im not an amazing student, i get A's and B's in close to equal numbers, and santa cruz has a lazy culture in some respects) and that ill ruin my chances of getting a transfer somewhere. Also very important (perhaps more important than UCSC vs U of O), I wasnt accepted from the waitlist at Haverford, however what if someone who they did accept doesnt choose to attend/isnt able to attend, wouldnt I be a possibility for getting a spot if that happened? What can I do to even get a plausable shot of still being accepted there, because Haverford is where I want to be next year in all honesty. Thank you so much for reading all of this, and I look forward to all comments suggestions and questions.\n\nI have enough money saved up (thanks to my grandmother, my parents were no help, but then thats probably normal) to have more than enough money for any UC/ out of state public school. At a private school I have enough money for 3 years, and I figure I can get a part time job to help pay for the last year (work all four years). My major would be something in the social sciences like anthropology, economics, statistics, or sociology. Im not sure what i want to do with my life, but working for an NGO in a third world country or becoming a constitutional lawyer are careers that seem attractive to me.

I\u2019m posting in the Parents Forum because most of my previous threads were here, and I would love for the many people who helped me out then to see how everything turned out.  I hope this thread will be helpful for kids or parents who in the same position I was\u2014that is, a high-stats applicant with high EFC looking for big merit aid at a small liberal arts college.\n\n(Note: If you were one of the wonderful parents who helped me out from my earlier threads, feel free to skip to the next post, where I\u2019ll put the actual results.)\n\nFor some background info: I had a 4.0 unweighted GPA with a fairly rigorous schedule and several APs, 2390 SAT, National Merit Finalist.  Heavily involved in competitive speech (state + regional awards), a hefty amount of volunteer work with a local nonprofit, work as a history and English tutor, participation in drama.\n\nI started out sophomore year where it seems most Los Angeles teenagers start out: looking into UCs.  I thought I would apply to all or most of the UCs and end up at UCSD or perhaps UCLA.  Then I toured Berkeley and UCLA the summer between sophomore and junior years and hated them.  Don\u2019t get me wrong, they are both excellent schools, but the sheer size and anonymity of the schools was extremely off-putting.  I began to gravitate towards smaller liberal arts colleges like Williams, Pomona, and Haverford.\n\nAt this point, I had not looked into costs at all.  Bombarded with the message that \u201cyou don\u2019t have to worry about cost because we have financial aid!\u201d, I naively assumed that finances would not be a problem.  This is where College Confidential saved my behind.  I stumbled across this website one day and after reading all the financial-shut-out horror stories, marched over to my parents and (politely) demanded they run the net price calculators and decide exactly how much they would be willing to pay for my college.\n\nWell.  Our EFC came out to around $50k/year at the most generous schools and full-pay at others, and my parents decided they could afford about $25k/year.  Of course, this was generous of them, but it was still something of a shock to realize that many of the schools I had been looking at were not even remotely affordable.  I was, and still am, very debt-averse and really hated the idea of student loans.  So I started looking at colleges where I would be awarded significant merit aid.\n\nThere were a few other factors that were important to me: small (<5,000 undergraduates); co-ed; wide variety of majors; more conservative politically; West and Midwest locations preferred over South and Northeast.  You can read more of the advice posters gave me here: http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/parents-forum/1552379-midwestern-colleges-for-a-california-girl-p1.html\n\nMy research strategy was basically to read through the Fiske and Princeton Review guides several times, putting sticky notes on liberal arts colleges that offered sufficient merit to bring the COA down to about $25k or less (based on scholarship listings on their websites).  I ranked the schools based on how large the scholarships were, how likely I was to receive one, and of course on the desirability of the schools themselves.

This site has offered me more valuable information than my guidance counselors ever attempted to offer. I feel obligated to post my results; Maybe my information will be of help to a rising senior in a similar situation.\n\nA brief overview of my application:\n\nAcademic: top 10% in class, 95/100 gpa, 2230 SAT, many dual enrollment courses related to engineering\n\nExtracirricular: 4 year varsity soccer letterman, captain, all section, 2 year tennis letterman, excellent musical ECs, independent music, A couple clubs, NHS, Lots of work experience\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nI began considering schools late in the summer after my junior year. I wanted to be a biomedical engineer. I was absolutely fascinated by the field and still am today. Here are the schools I applied to.\n\n\nSchools:\nStanford\nDuke\nJohns Hopkins\nGeorgia Tech\nPenn State\nPitt\nCase Western\nSt. Olaf\n\n* I actually applied to ~20 schools, but for the sake of brevity, I am only including the significant ones. *\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nStanford- I applied regular decision with my friend because we both had dreams of living in California at the best school in the world doing what we loved. I knew all along that I had no chance, but it didn't keep me from hoping. I took a few risks on my essays because I figured it would help me stand out. I applied under the bioengineering major with a secondary interest in music technology. I sent in multiple updates via fax about things I had accomplished after I submitted my application. I was rejected.\n\nDuke- Duke was the only school that offered me an interview. I thought it went very well; my interviewer said he was very impressed and said he expected I would be accepted based off of my dual enrollment pursuits. I wasn't optimistic, however. I knew that the admit rate for RD would be terrible. I applied to Pratt as a biomedical engineer. I also sent in multiple fax updates. I was rejected.\n\nJohns Hopkins- I put more time into this application than any other. I figured it was my best shot at a top twenty school. I applied as a biomedical engineer, hopeful that I could at least get into the school if not the BME program. I displayed an interest in cross registering at the Peabody conservatory to take courses for recording arts and sciences. I applied RD. I was rejected.\n\nGeorgia Tech- I applied RD to Tech. I was accepted, which, at the time, felt like a pretty big accomplishment. I am out of state and it was the RD round. Yay me. Unfortunately, complications arose with the fafsa and I could not correct the mistakes in time to receive a financial aid package. I received no aid, scholarship, or loans from Tech.\n\nPenn State- I applied at Penn State early in January. This was idiotic and probably one of my biggest regrets in the whole process. I would have been a good contender for Schreyer had I applied on time. I was rejected from Main, presumably becuase spots were already filled. I was accepted to a branch campus with some scholarship and aid. PSU is by far my most affordable option.\n\nPitt- I applied to Pitt once I realized things weren't panning out with my other schools. I actually applied in early April, fully aware that my chances with Swanson were slim to none. I received an email 3 weeks ago saying I was accepted at Dietrich but waitlisted at Swanson. I am currently on the waitlist. I could not chose to accept Dietrich and the waitlist. Due to how late I applied, I received zero aid.\n\nCase Western- I thought I would be a shoe in at Case, and in the fall, Case was my number one choice. I applied early action as a biomedical engineer and was deferred. I was disheartened at this point and began looking for a new school to focus on. Come the RD round, I was waitlisted. Two days ago I received an email from Case saying that I was accepted off the waitlist with a substantial scholarship and financial aid offer.\n\nSt. Olaf- I applied to St. Olaf because it was free and had a good music and math program. I enjoyed writing my essay for St. Olaf more than any other school. I got to write about my two greatest passions: Music and mathematics. However, the rest of my application was not nearly what it could have been. I didn't edit/revise anything. I didn't include anything about my dual enrollment pursuits. What did I care though? The school is 1000 miles away and I wasn't seriously considering it. The school doesn't have an engineering department so I applied as a math major. I was accepted with a decent scholarship and good aid.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nMy regrets:\n-General lack of knowledge during the application process.\n-Applying late to my match schools\n-Setting my sights too high\n-Not spending enough time on my applications to my match schools. I feel I could have gotten way more merit scholarship.\n-Didn't apply ED anywhere\n\nThis is not a full list. If I wrote down every regret I have had during this whole process, this post would qualify as a novel. If you would like to know specifically what I would have done differently, let me know.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nMy decision:\n\nThis evening, I decided that I will be attending St. Olaf College in Northfield, Minnesota. I will be double majoring in mathematics and musical composition. Are you confused? You should be. I sure am.\n\nFor the past two years, I have been certain that engineering is right for me. I have taken many math and engineering courses outside of high school, and all my teachers and peers have expected me to pursue that. However, music has always been a big part of my life as well. I have performed in many ensembles with many talented people. I have also had a passion for writing music. As a matter of fact, my senior project was to compose a piece for our concert band to perform. Extremely long story extremely short: Over the past two months I have fallen in love with St. Olaf. I have realized that I need to pursue my passion for composition. I actually just got home today from my weekend visit on campus. It is a gorgeous place with incredible people. I know I might sound fickle and naive, but I assure you this decision was well thought out and all things have been considered. I have just chosen to condense my decision making process to save space. I can expand upon my decision in the comments if anybody would like to know.\n\nI am glad that I was rejected by JHU, Duke, and Stanford. I mean that with utmost sincerity. If I were accepted, I would have been blinded by prestige and unable to make my decision wisely.\n\nI hate cliches, but it seems appropriate to say that everything happens for a reason. I don't believe in fate or higher powers controlling what goes on in the world, so there might be a better way to say what I am thinking. Be prepared for rejection. Always look for opportunities. Pursue your passion. There, that's better.\n\n\n"}, {"date": "2012-03-28T22:01:00+00:00", "url": "http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/what-my-chances/1311666-seniors-actual-results-thread-for-prestigious-schools.html", "messages": "\n                    Hey I know a lot of people want actual results so i thought i'd follow up to my chances thread with what actually happened!\nhttp://talk.collegeconfidential.com/what-my-chances/1295780-chance-chance-back-lolz.html was the original thread\nI applied to BC, BU, Colorado college, Colgate, Emory, Haverford, Lafayette, Pitzer, William and Mary, Richmond, Vassar, Delaware, Maryland, and Fordham.

I was somewhat surprised not to find scanned copies of actual score reports readily available online.  Perhaps I had to much confidence in the ubiquity of information on this Interweb thing, but I did not have a ton of luck tracking down actuals.  The SSAT folks have a pdf copy of an 8th grade upper level score report, but it seemed funny to me - it shows 800 math score with 41 correct answers and 9 incorrect answers. This would give a raw score of 38.75, which seems unlikely to be associated with an 800...\n\nAnyway, does anyone know of places with posted actual test results?

We were skeptical at first because we receive many different \"offers\" in the mail.  We inquired and found out that a teacher at our school actually nominated him.  I think we are like most parents in that we want to support our child and be good stewards with our money investing in the areas of life that are most beneficial.  So after some research, we decided to try it.\n\nWe attended the 2015 Congress of Future Scientists and Technologists this past June and found it to be a very informative and inspiring event.  I am amazed at the amount of negative comments and can only attribute it to not having a full understanding of what these conferences are actually about.  This is not a class, although through Washington Adventist University, you may receive 1 elective college credit if you complete their course requirements.  This is not something special to put on your college application.  It is an experience that brings together a group of scientists, visionaries, and motivational speaker to broaden your child's world view and inspire them to pursue their dreams in the field of STEM.  Oftentimes schools are greatly lacking in STEM content and are not geared toward highly motivated students. Everyone leads different lives, however this was a great opportunity for our child to meet a Nobel Prize winner, Astronaut Buzz Aldrin, or Entrepreneurs like Dean Kaem in person. Our son left with a renewed sense of confidence and purpose and as soon as we got home started working again on experimental projects that had given him difficulty. He also left with a bunch of business cards and contact information from fellow attendees and is already starting to collaborate with them on different projects.  (Our son sometimes doesn't \"fully connect\" with fellow schoolmates but has remained long time friends with fellow attendees of MSSEF or Broadcom MASTERS).  No, it doesn't help you get in to college, but it may inspire you to attempt things that you wouldn't normally do or obtain a mentor to work with, and set yourself apart on your college application.\n\nAs far as the cost of the program, we travel for our professional conferences each year and you must pay for your membership, each event/class, travel, lodging, and food. We easily expend triple the cost of this conference, however, we feel the benefit derived is immeasurable. The cost and time involved in putting something like this on is enormous.  We don't begrudge any compensation that the company putting on the Congress (or any conference we attend) makes- if we could put the Congress on ourselves, we would. My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed the Congress and would have paid to attend ourselves, so its a great benefit that your entire family may attend for free. They also emailed out a live stream link that allowed you to send it to whomever you desired so they could virtually attend as well as direct invitations to 5 teachers of your choosing.  One last benefit was that if you had your GPA verified, you were inducted into the Society of Torch and Laurel which can be helpful with preparing for college.\n\nWas everything perfect, no, nothing ever is.  The choice of venue was just ok, traffic flow was terrible, and the general area was overwhelmed by our presence.   The food, which was offered by the venue, could have been more nutritious, but they did allow 2 hour breaks so you could leave and try and find a restaurant of your choosing or have a bagged lunch.  Will we attend next year?  Yes, without hesitation.  If you have reasonable expectations and a student who loves STEM, we think you'll find it beneficial. Everything we do in life is an investment, it's just a matter of where your priorities lie.                "}]
