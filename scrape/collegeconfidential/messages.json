I was admitted off the waitlist. I was accepted to EVERY school I applied to including all the UC's, CSUSM, and SDSU.\n\nLook through the posts in that thread. People said that I shouldn't even bother applying to certain colleges because I wasn't good enough. One thing I regret about college applications is the fact that I let the people on the College Confidential forum get to me and lower my self worth. They made me feel worthless, like I wouldn't even be accepted to a CSU(if you look through my other threads). I actually went through a period of depression because I didn't think any school would want me and it affected my grades.\n\nBut look at me now, a proud Bruin! One thing I have to say to all you college applicants: You guys don't give yourself enough credit for all your hard work. I know because I didn't at first. Please remember that you are a superb student, and do NOT let others define you. This is a lesson learned in time, but you all will understand eventually!

I think I applied as an Anthropology/ Cultural Studies Major\n\nWilliams- Knowing what I know now this would have been my first choice at the beginning, they have a great squash coach/team, and excellent academics obviously. I was rejected and I applied as anthro/cultural studies\n\n'Reach Schools' (read: I think i worked hard enough to get in, but it didnt happen for me):\nUC Berkeley- I was rejected initially and on appeal, I'm a decent writer, and I thought my letter appealing my rejection projected honesty and dedication, without complaining, but it didnt work out.\n\nHaverford College- Knowing what I know now, this is the place I wish I was going next year, more than Columbia or Williams, more than Berkeley. The squash coach and the people on the squash team are really cool. I did everything i could just to get on the waitlist (using a family connection, meeting the squash coach, visiting the campus, etc), yesterday i received mail telling me they didnt have any space, im so disappointed and kind of defeated because I really tried to get in here.\n\nUCLA- I didnt want to go to UCLA, way too close to home, but ill put it here because it qualifies, I was rejected, and im a little upset because other people at my high school go in who I felt were less qualified. However, I would not go to UCLA even had I been accepted, so good call from them to not accept me.\n\nUSC- read UCLA, same deal, other less qualified (imo) people at my school were accepted.\n\nUCSD- I didnt really think of this as a reach school, i honestly thought I was assured acceptance, but I was offered the waitlist, whcih i passed on because San Diego is in SoCal, and I visited it and its kind of lame.\n\nSafety Schools (I got accepted at these schools, and I knew I would):\n\nUC Merced- surprise surprise\nUC Riverside-see merced\nUCSB-  too many frat boys sorority girls, could have been fun, but not really my thing\nUC Davis- Lovely campus, the nicest of the UC's, I visited and the town is really weak. I think i would only survive frosh year because thats the year you live on campus.\nUC Irvine- ew, this school will ruin your life seriously, its like going back to high school, i know soooooo many people going there and i just smh and smile at them and tell them theyll have a great time, who am i to step on their dreams?\nUC Santa Cruz- very beautiful campus, has all the great student housing options that Santa Barbara has, but with hippies (I like hippies) instead of  the bro's. This is most where Im registered at, though I still have some time to decide on...\n\nUniversity of Oregon- i have till the 23rd of may to make up my mind, and i will probably visit on the 22nd. I hear conflicting things (hopefully someone can clarify): some people say U of O is on the up and up, buying good professors and recruiting good students. Others say its really not that great and that its 111th ranking in US News/world report says it all.\n\nSummary: I am deciding between Santa Cruz which I like, and Oregon which I also like (no visit yet though), at both I would be looking to try to transfer somewhere else after frosh. Im just not satisfied with either. Major worries for santa cruz are that ill become a complacent slacker (you saw my grades, im not an amazing student, i get A's and B's in close to equal numbers, and santa cruz has a lazy culture in some respects) and that ill ruin my chances of getting a transfer somewhere. Also very important (perhaps more important than UCSC vs U of O), I wasnt accepted from the waitlist at Haverford, however what if someone who they did accept doesnt choose to attend/isnt able to attend, wouldnt I be a possibility for getting a spot if that happened? What can I do to even get a plausable shot of still being accepted there, because Haverford is where I want to be next year in all honesty. Thank you so much for reading all of this, and I look forward to all comments suggestions and questions.\n\nI have enough money saved up (thanks to my grandmother, my parents were no help, but then thats probably normal) to have more than enough money for any UC/ out of state public school. At a private school I have enough money for 3 years, and I figure I can get a part time job to help pay for the last year (work all four years). My major would be something in the social sciences like anthropology, economics, statistics, or sociology. Im not sure what i want to do with my life, but working for an NGO in a third world country or becoming a constitutional lawyer are careers that seem attractive to me.

I\u2019m posting in the Parents Forum because most of my previous threads were here, and I would love for the many people who helped me out then to see how everything turned out.  I hope this thread will be helpful for kids or parents who in the same position I was\u2014that is, a high-stats applicant with high EFC looking for big merit aid at a small liberal arts college.\n\n(Note: If you were one of the wonderful parents who helped me out from my earlier threads, feel free to skip to the next post, where I\u2019ll put the actual results.)\n\nFor some background info: I had a 4.0 unweighted GPA with a fairly rigorous schedule and several APs, 2390 SAT, National Merit Finalist.  Heavily involved in competitive speech (state + regional awards), a hefty amount of volunteer work with a local nonprofit, work as a history and English tutor, participation in drama.\n\nI started out sophomore year where it seems most Los Angeles teenagers start out: looking into UCs.  I thought I would apply to all or most of the UCs and end up at UCSD or perhaps UCLA.  Then I toured Berkeley and UCLA the summer between sophomore and junior years and hated them.  Don\u2019t get me wrong, they are both excellent schools, but the sheer size and anonymity of the schools was extremely off-putting.  I began to gravitate towards smaller liberal arts colleges like Williams, Pomona, and Haverford.\n\nAt this point, I had not looked into costs at all.  Bombarded with the message that \u201cyou don\u2019t have to worry about cost because we have financial aid!\u201d, I naively assumed that finances would not be a problem.  This is where College Confidential saved my behind.  I stumbled across this website one day and after reading all the financial-shut-out horror stories, marched over to my parents and (politely) demanded they run the net price calculators and decide exactly how much they would be willing to pay for my college.\n\nWell.  Our EFC came out to around $50k/year at the most generous schools and full-pay at others, and my parents decided they could afford about $25k/year.  Of course, this was generous of them, but it was still something of a shock to realize that many of the schools I had been looking at were not even remotely affordable.  I was, and still am, very debt-averse and really hated the idea of student loans.  So I started looking at colleges where I would be awarded significant merit aid.\n\nThere were a few other factors that were important to me: small (<5,000 undergraduates); co-ed; wide variety of majors; more conservative politically; West and Midwest locations preferred over South and Northeast.  You can read more of the advice posters gave me here: http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/parents-forum/1552379-midwestern-colleges-for-a-california-girl-p1.html\n\nMy research strategy was basically to read through the Fiske and Princeton Review guides several times, putting sticky notes on liberal arts colleges that offered sufficient merit to bring the COA down to about $25k or less (based on scholarship listings on their websites).  I ranked the schools based on how large the scholarships were, how likely I was to receive one, and of course on the desirability of the schools themselves.

This site has offered me more valuable information than my guidance counselors ever attempted to offer. I feel obligated to post my results; Maybe my information will be of help to a rising senior in a similar situation.\n\nA brief overview of my application:\n\nAcademic: top 10% in class, 95/100 gpa, 2230 SAT, many dual enrollment courses related to engineering\n\nExtracirricular: 4 year varsity soccer letterman, captain, all section, 2 year tennis letterman, excellent musical ECs, independent music, A couple clubs, NHS, Lots of work experience\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nI began considering schools late in the summer after my junior year. I wanted to be a biomedical engineer. I was absolutely fascinated by the field and still am today. Here are the schools I applied to.\n\n\nSchools:\nStanford\nDuke\nJohns Hopkins\nGeorgia Tech\nPenn State\nPitt\nCase Western\nSt. Olaf\n\n* I actually applied to ~20 schools, but for the sake of brevity, I am only including the significant ones. *\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nStanford- I applied regular decision with my friend because we both had dreams of living in California at the best school in the world doing what we loved. I knew all along that I had no chance, but it didn't keep me from hoping. I took a few risks on my essays because I figured it would help me stand out. I applied under the bioengineering major with a secondary interest in music technology. I sent in multiple updates via fax about things I had accomplished after I submitted my application. I was rejected.\n\nDuke- Duke was the only school that offered me an interview. I thought it went very well; my interviewer said he was very impressed and said he expected I would be accepted based off of my dual enrollment pursuits. I wasn't optimistic, however. I knew that the admit rate for RD would be terrible. I applied to Pratt as a biomedical engineer. I also sent in multiple fax updates. I was rejected.\n\nJohns Hopkins- I put more time into this application than any other. I figured it was my best shot at a top twenty school. I applied as a biomedical engineer, hopeful that I could at least get into the school if not the BME program. I displayed an interest in cross registering at the Peabody conservatory to take courses for recording arts and sciences. I applied RD. I was rejected.\n\nGeorgia Tech- I applied RD to Tech. I was accepted, which, at the time, felt like a pretty big accomplishment. I am out of state and it was the RD round. Yay me. Unfortunately, complications arose with the fafsa and I could not correct the mistakes in time to receive a financial aid package. I received no aid, scholarship, or loans from Tech.\n\nPenn State- I applied at Penn State early in January. This was idiotic and probably one of my biggest regrets in the whole process. I would have been a good contender for Schreyer had I applied on time. I was rejected from Main, presumably becuase spots were already filled. I was accepted to a branch campus with some scholarship and aid. PSU is by far my most affordable option.\n\nPitt- I applied to Pitt once I realized things weren't panning out with my other schools. I actually applied in early April, fully aware that my chances with Swanson were slim to none. I received an email 3 weeks ago saying I was accepted at Dietrich but waitlisted at Swanson. I am currently on the waitlist. I could not chose to accept Dietrich and the waitlist. Due to how late I applied, I received zero aid.\n\nCase Western- I thought I would be a shoe in at Case, and in the fall, Case was my number one choice. I applied early action as a biomedical engineer and was deferred. I was disheartened at this point and began looking for a new school to focus on. Come the RD round, I was waitlisted. Two days ago I received an email from Case saying that I was accepted off the waitlist with a substantial scholarship and financial aid offer.\n\nSt. Olaf- I applied to St. Olaf because it was free and had a good music and math program. I enjoyed writing my essay for St. Olaf more than any other school. I got to write about my two greatest passions: Music and mathematics. However, the rest of my application was not nearly what it could have been. I didn't edit/revise anything. I didn't include anything about my dual enrollment pursuits. What did I care though? The school is 1000 miles away and I wasn't seriously considering it. The school doesn't have an engineering department so I applied as a math major. I was accepted with a decent scholarship and good aid.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nMy regrets:\n-General lack of knowledge during the application process.\n-Applying late to my match schools\n-Setting my sights too high\n-Not spending enough time on my applications to my match schools. I feel I could have gotten way more merit scholarship.\n-Didn't apply ED anywhere\n\nThis is not a full list. If I wrote down every regret I have had during this whole process, this post would qualify as a novel. If you would like to know specifically what I would have done differently, let me know.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nMy decision:\n\nThis evening, I decided that I will be attending St. Olaf College in Northfield, Minnesota. I will be double majoring in mathematics and musical composition. Are you confused? You should be. I sure am.\n\nFor the past two years, I have been certain that engineering is right for me. I have taken many math and engineering courses outside of high school, and all my teachers and peers have expected me to pursue that. However, music has always been a big part of my life as well. I have performed in many ensembles with many talented people. I have also had a passion for writing music. As a matter of fact, my senior project was to compose a piece for our concert band to perform. Extremely long story extremely short: Over the past two months I have fallen in love with St. Olaf. I have realized that I need to pursue my passion for composition. I actually just got home today from my weekend visit on campus. It is a gorgeous place with incredible people. I know I might sound fickle and naive, but I assure you this decision was well thought out and all things have been considered. I have just chosen to condense my decision making process to save space. I can expand upon my decision in the comments if anybody would like to know.\n\nI am glad that I was rejected by JHU, Duke, and Stanford. I mean that with utmost sincerity. If I were accepted, I would have been blinded by prestige and unable to make my decision wisely.\n\nI hate cliches, but it seems appropriate to say that everything happens for a reason. I don't believe in fate or higher powers controlling what goes on in the world, so there might be a better way to say what I am thinking. Be prepared for rejection. Always look for opportunities. Pursue your passion. There, that's better.\n\n\n"}, {"date": "2012-03-28T22:01:00+00:00", "url": "http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/what-my-chances/1311666-seniors-actual-results-thread-for-prestigious-schools.html", "messages": "\n                    Hey I know a lot of people want actual results so i thought i'd follow up to my chances thread with what actually happened!\nhttp://talk.collegeconfidential.com/what-my-chances/1295780-chance-chance-back-lolz.html was the original thread\nI applied to BC, BU, Colorado college, Colgate, Emory, Haverford, Lafayette, Pitzer, William and Mary, Richmond, Vassar, Delaware, Maryland, and Fordham.

Perhaps I had to much confidence in the ubiquity of information on this Interweb thing, but I did not have a ton of luck tracking down actuals.  The SSAT folks have a pdf copy of an 8th grade upper level score report, but it seemed funny to me - it shows 800 math score with 41 correct answers and 9 incorrect answers. This would give a raw score of 38.75, which seems unlikely to be associated with an 800...\n\nAnyway, does anyone know of places with posted actual test results?

We were skeptical at first because we receive many different \"offers\" in the mail.  We inquired and found out that a teacher at our school actually nominated him.  I think we are like most parents in that we want to support our child and be good stewards with our money investing in the areas of life that are most beneficial.  So after some research, we decided to try it.\n\nWe attended the 2015 Congress of Future Scientists and Technologists this past June and found it to be a very informative and inspiring event.  I am amazed at the amount of negative comments and can only attribute it to not having a full understanding of what these conferences are actually about.  This is not a class, although through Washington Adventist University, you may receive 1 elective college credit if you complete their course requirements.  This is not something special to put on your college application.  It is an experience that brings together a group of scientists, visionaries, and motivational speaker to broaden your child's world view and inspire them to pursue their dreams in the field of STEM.  Oftentimes schools are greatly lacking in STEM content and are not geared toward highly motivated students. Everyone leads different lives, however this was a great opportunity for our child to meet a Nobel Prize winner, Astronaut Buzz Aldrin, or Entrepreneurs like Dean Kaem in person. Our son left with a renewed sense of confidence and purpose and as soon as we got home started working again on experimental projects that had given him difficulty. He also left with a bunch of business cards and contact information from fellow attendees and is already starting to collaborate with them on different projects.  (Our son sometimes doesn't \"fully connect\" with fellow schoolmates but has remained long time friends with fellow attendees of MSSEF or Broadcom MASTERS).  No, it doesn't help you get in to college, but it may inspire you to attempt things that you wouldn't normally do or obtain a mentor to work with, and set yourself apart on your college application.\n\nAs far as the cost of the program, we travel for our professional conferences each year and you must pay for your membership, each event/class, travel, lodging, and food. We easily expend triple the cost of this conference, however, we feel the benefit derived is immeasurable. The cost and time involved in putting something like this on is enormous.  We don't begrudge any compensation that the company putting on the Congress (or any conference we attend) makes- if we could put the Congress on ourselves, we would. My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed the Congress and would have paid to attend ourselves, so its a great benefit that your entire family may attend for free. They also emailed out a live stream link that allowed you to send it to whomever you desired so they could virtually attend as well as direct invitations to 5 teachers of your choosing.  One last benefit was that if you had your GPA verified, you were inducted into the Society of Torch and Laurel which can be helpful with preparing for college.\n\nWas everything perfect, no, nothing ever is.  The choice of venue was just ok, traffic flow was terrible, and the general area was overwhelmed by our presence.   The food, which was offered by the venue, could have been more nutritious, but they did allow 2 hour breaks so you could leave and try and find a restaurant of your choosing or have a bagged lunch.  Will we attend next year?  Yes, without hesitation.  If you have reasonable expectations and a student who loves STEM, we think you'll find it beneficial. Everything we do in life is an investment, it's just a matter of where your priorities lie.

I applied last year and got rejected by most of the colleges I applied to and this year is no different - but thank God, I'm finally able to go to a college that is affordable. The rejections and especially waitlists hurt, but now I'm learning to focus on the positive things only, I figure starting a thread like this will be helpful for international students who will apply in the upcoming years.\n\nSo here is my stats:\n\nSAT I: 2260 (single sitting) - 730 CR, 800 M, 730 WR.\nSAT II: 800 Math II, 770 Math I, 770 Chemistry.\nIELTS: 7.5/9.0 (should have taken again to improve, but I think it doesn't really matter so why waste the money..)\nGPA: 9.0/10 - 3.94 US equivalent.\nRank (percentile if rank is unavailable): N/A\nAwards: Bronze Medal in an international science camp (actually not as major as it sounds); Merit-based scholarships for top students - all 3 years of high school.\nExtracurriculars: very unique and unusual; I don't participate in many different activities, but I was really committed to each one. But to be fair, I'd say my extracurricular activities are the weakness of my application.\nEssays: Common App 9-9.5/10 (I wrote about my relationship with my dad and how I learned to accept him in my life again)\nTeacher Recommendation: #1 from my English teacher, #2 from my Vietnamese Literature teacher - both are very personal and amazing.\nCounselor Recommendation: glowing - she knows my family situation better than anyone and she supported me through the whole process.\nAdditional Recommendation: one from my writing advisor/college admission counselor - I'm her favorite and one of the best students she ever had (her words) so I'd think this letter definitely helps my application.\nMajor: English Literature - may double major with Economics or something more practical.\nCountry (if international applicant): Vietnam\nSchool Type: Public, ranked 1st nationally.\nEthnicity: Asian\nGender: Female\nIncome Bracket: <20K.\n\nDecisions:\nAccepted at: Temple University (full tuition + summer stipends), Miami University - Ohio (full tuition), Earlham College (the package is very generous but still not affordable).\nRejected at: Amherst, Bryn Mawr (Deferred from ED2), Scripps, Sewanee, St. Lawrence, Smith.\nWaitlisted at: Case Western Reserve, Franklin & Marshall, Gettysburg, Rhodes, Trinity University, NYUAD, NYUSH.\nWaiting on: Reed (Deferred from ED) and UNC - Chapel Hill - I'm pretty sure I'll be rejected at this point.\n\nWhat to do next: Trying to negotiate with Earlham to get 5k more and deciding between Temple and Miami-OH. \\\n\nAdvice to prospective international students: Hope for the best, but ALWAYS prepare yourself for the worst. Many people told me that I should have gotten in at least 1-2 top schools in my list, but right now I'm just grateful that my plans worked out, otherwise I'd have to stay in Vietnam or go to Bulgaria for a school I was guaranteed admission there. Also, taking a gap year may help your application but bad things could always happen, so you should have a solid backup plan back home. And don't get obsessed with admission - getting into a top school should never be your main priority, and your life should never revolve around it only.\n\nLastly, I want to thank @MYOS1634\u200c for guiding me throughout this process, and everyone who has given me helpful advice. This year has been really difficult for me but now everything is over I can finally rest and enjoy my life. I hope this thread proves to be useful for any international student who needs huge financial aid like me.

The results echo what you see everywhere else, with a few exceptions. There are definiitely niche schools, or schools that have special appeal to certain demographics (for example, Notre Dame is a favorite of Catholics) which enhance their ranks.

I know you can put down your AP scores on your application, but how do they notice that the test score was the result of self-study? It is not going to show up on your transcript, but what if the admissions officer is quickly going through your transcript and just assumes you took the class. What good did it do you? Do we have any real evidence from some of the admissions officers that have come to CC to tell us what they think of AP self-study?

This seems an appropriate place to post it.\n\nCC has been helpful over the past 6 months. This site has offered me invaluable information about the application process. I feel obligated to post my results; Maybe my information will be of help to a rising senior in a similar situation.\n\nA brief overview of my application:\n\nAcademic: top 10% in class, 95/100 gpa, 2230 SAT, many dual enrollment courses related to engineering\n\nExtracirricular: 4 year varsity soccer letterman, captain, all section, 2 year tennis letterman, excellent musical ECs, independent music, A couple clubs, NHS, Lots of work experience\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nI began considering schools late in the summer after my junior year. I wanted to be a biomedical engineer. I was absolutely fascinated by the field and still am today. Here are the schools I applied to.\n\n\nSchools:\nStanford\nDuke\nJohns Hopkins\nGeorgia Tech\nPenn State\nPitt\nCase Western\nSt. Olaf\n\n* I actually applied to ~20 schools, but for the sake of brevity, I am only including the significant ones. *\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nStanford- I applied regular decision with my friend because we both had dreams of living in California at the best school in the world doing what we loved. I knew all along that I had no chance, but it didn't keep me from hoping. I took a few risks on my essays because I figured it would help me stand out. I applied under the bioengineering major with a secondary interest in music technology. I sent in multiple updates via fax about things I had accomplished after I submitted my application. I was rejected.\n\nDuke- Duke was the only school that offered me an interview. I thought it went very well; my interviewer said he was very impressed and said he expected I would be accepted based off of my dual enrollment pursuits. I wasn't optimistic, however. I knew that the admit rate for RD would be terrible. I applied to Pratt as a biomedical engineer. I also sent in multiple fax updates. I was rejected.\n\nJohns Hopkins- I put more time into this application than any other. I figured it was my best shot at a top twenty school. I applied as a biomedical engineer, hopeful that I could at least get into the school if not the BME program. I displayed an interest in cross registering at the Peabody conservatory to take courses for recording arts and sciences. I applied RD. I was rejected.\n\nGeorgia Tech- I applied RD to Tech. I was accepted, which, at the time, felt like a pretty big accomplishment. I am out of state and it was the RD round. Yay me. Unfortunately, complications arose with the fafsa and I could not correct the mistakes in time to receive a financial aid package. I received no aid, scholarship, or loans from Tech.\n\nPenn State- I applied at Penn State early in January. This was idiotic and probably one of my biggest regrets in the whole process. I would have been a good contender for Schreyer had I applied on time. I was rejected from Main, presumably becuase spots were already filled. I was accepted to a branch campus with some scholarship and aid. PSU is by far my most affordable option.\n\nPitt- I applied to Pitt once I realized things weren't panning out with my other schools. I actually applied in early April, fully aware that my chances with Swanson were slim to none. I received an email 3 weeks ago saying I was accepted at Dietrich but waitlisted at Swanson. I am currently on the waitlist. I could not chose to accept Dietrich and the waitlist. Due to how late I applied, I received zero aid.\n\nCase Western- I thought I would be a shoe in at Case, and in the fall, Case was my number one choice. I applied early action as a biomedical engineer and was deferred. I was disheartened at this point and began looking for a new school to focus on. Come the RD round, I was waitlisted. Two days ago I received an email from Case saying that I was accepted off the waitlist with a substantial scholarship and financial aid offer.\n\nSt. Olaf- I applied to St. Olaf because it was free and had a good music and math program. I enjoyed writing my essay for St. Olaf more than any other school. I got to write about my two greatest passions: Music and mathematics. However, the rest of my application was not nearly what it could have been. I didn't edit/revise anything. I didn't include anything about my dual enrollment pursuits. What did I care though? The school is 1000 miles away and I wasn't seriously considering it. The school doesn't have an engineering department so I applied as a math major. I was accepted with a decent scholarship and good aid.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nMy regrets:\n-General lack of knowledge during the application process.\n-Applying late to my match schools\n-Setting my sights too high\n-Not spending enough time on my applications to my match schools. I feel I could have gotten way more merit scholarship.\n-Didn't apply ED anywhere\n\nThis is not a full list. If I wrote down every regret I have had during this whole process, this post would qualify as a novel. If you would like to know specifically what I would have done differently, let me know.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nMy decision:\n\nThis evening, I decided that I will be attending St. Olaf College in Northfield, Minnesota. I will be double majoring in mathematics and musical composition. Are you confused? You should be. I sure am.\n\nFor the past two years, I have been certain that engineering is right for me. I have taken many math and engineering courses outside of high school, and all my teachers and peers have expected me to pursue that. However, music has always been a big part of my life as well. I have performed in many ensembles with many talented people. I have also had a passion for writing music. As a matter of fact, my senior project was to compose a piece for our concert band to perform. Extremely long story extremely short: Over the past two months I have fallen in love with St. Olaf. I have realized that I need to pursue my passion for composition. I actually just got home today from my weekend visit on campus. It is a gorgeous place with incredible people. I know I might sound fickle and naive, but I assure you this decision was well thought out and all things have been considered. I have just chosen to condense my decision making process to save space. I can expand upon my decision in the comments if anybody would like to know.\n\nI am glad that I was rejected by JHU, Duke, and Stanford. I mean that with utmost sincerity. If I were accepted, I would have been blinded by prestige and unable to make my decision wisely.\n\nI hate cliches, but it seems appropriate to say that everything happens for a reason. I don't believe in fate or higher powers controlling what goes on in the world, so there might be a better way to say what I am thinking. Be prepared for rejection. Always look for opportunities. Pursue your passion. There, that's better.

HYPSM usually never take more than 1 student from our school unless they're legacy.\n\nStats:\nSAT I: 800M, 780 CR, 780 W (9/12 essay) on only attempt.\nSAT II: 800s on math 2, physics, world, u.s history, and chem. 770 and 780 on bio m.\nAPs: all 5s Calculus BC, World History, Biology, Physics B, U.S History, Statistics (self-study), Physics C both parts, Chemistry, Lang comp.\n\nGPA: 3.92 UW, no weighted. By far my biggest weakness, would be lowest non-legacy gpa to get into a top ~ 10 college in school's history. Doesn't help that it's a downwards trend; aside from a B+ as a 8th grader on honors precalculus due to blowing off HW, straight As up till junior year. In my junior year, I got a B- in AP english language and composition as the teacher is an extremely harsh grader (grades about 20 points lower than the other AP teacher, gave me a 5/9 on practice AP essay (which would make a 5/5 on the AP extremely unlikely), and a 4/6 on the regents practice essay when I got a 6/6 on the actual exam). However, I doubt most colleges will know this and may just assume that I'm another stereotypical asian who just sucks at english and is a tryhard test-taker. (I am actually known in my school for my laziness and would consider myself fairly good, although not brilliant, at English). Doesn't also help that I got lazy junior year and earned an A- in honors spanish due to late work. Additionally, I received an A- in my first semester creative writing class this year with senioritis, although I have straight As in all my other classes (miraculously).\n\nClass rank: barely in the top 10% if at all.\n\nCourse Rigor: very high, have taken more AP exams than anyone has in years, also took linear algebra with differential equations  on a full scholarship at the local top 40 university last spring and earned an A. Took Multivariable calculus through my HS as a sophomore, and am currently enrolled in an online probability theory math course through UIUC and a pair of CS courses (through coursera and I need to make an update on this).\n\nSenior year courses: Ap spanish, ap gov pol, apes, ap comp Sci, orchestra, creative writing, literature of social criticism, health, psychology (self-study AP).\n\nAwards: 2x United States of America junior olympiad  qualifier (grades 9-10) (have a 50% admit rate to mit, only 250 nationwide out of 200k who take entry level exams), high scorer at American regional mathematics league (~120 people out of 2k participants), 2x high scorer at state math competition; 4th last year. Rennselaer medal (60k merit scholarship to RPI given to 1 junior by participating HSs), national merit semi-finalist, rsi alternate (might be mentioned in rec letter).\n\nECs (in order from common-app).\nMath team: 6-year participant, state qualifier since 8th grade, 2013 team mvp, captain.\nViolin: plays for school and local youth orchestra, have played since 3rd grade.\nResearch internship at local physics laboratory last summer: accomplished nothing of note.\n\nVolleyball: played for school and club teams since 8th grade, accomplished nothing of note.\n\nMathcounts assistant coach (9-12) saved program after old coach retired, spoke with middle school principal to continue it, have assisted coaches.\n\nHS math circle co-founder: grades 11-12, allow students to participate in more competitions.\n\nChess team: participated since grade 8, have served as key organizer since grade 9 (no official title), won county championships last year.\n\nScience Olympiad (9-12): pair of state medals, extremely strong performance at regionals competitons. No leadership however, I believe it is a harm.\n\nHospital volunteering (9-12): ~ 130 hours at a pair of them.\n\nFbla vice-president (10-12): 2nd, 3rd, 5th last year at states, a single 5th the year before, attended national leadership Confrence in 2014.\n\nTeacher Rec 1; from math team coach and calc III teacher, known me since 7th grad, speaks to incredible accomplishments never done in school history, refers to me as one of her best students, and talks of my leadership skills and growth.\nTeacher Rec 2: from grade 10 and current English teacher, Fairly average, says I'm more than what meets the eye, versatile, talks about me winning awards in mun too (where I also probably should have leadership but don't).\nCounselor rec: probably ok, either my ap world or Apush teacher described me as one of their best students ever too in their recs to her, but I unfortunately didn't ask either for a teacher rec. She said she did quote those parts however, and had the best teacher quotes for me vs any other student (and she has some of my main competitors).\n\nNo additional rec\n\nCommon app essay: wrote it about internship: lazy topic, not too much substance, lack of mentor rec may be suspicious.\n\nSchools(interview experience, supplementals, competitors, majors).\n\nStanford (REA): applied for math, somewhat awkward interview, great essays I thought. Had some mix-ups in ECs placed on common app, lower first quarter grades than I ended up with for mid-year. Rejected, a local girl with a below 2200 sat (but high grades and great leaderships and of course sibling alum got in).\n\nMIT: off common app, wrote good essay that spoke to my individuality. Solid interview. Main competitor from my school is an international student with perfect gpa, great Recs, and a solid number of leaderships, but Canadian got him deferred at princeton EA and may similarly ruin him here. Last asian male to get mit from our school was 14 years ago.\nApplied for 18C (applied math with CS).\n\nPrinceton: same essay as harvard. Good interview though I had some gaffes (notably asking him if he went there for law school (he was a lawyer) based on Carlton and will's uncle going to princeton law in the fresh prince of bel-air) and him saying mit would be right up my alley, he emailed me randomly 2 weeks later saying he submitted an enthusiastic rec and is wishing me the best. Main competition is the yale kid. I have hopes in princeton's yield protection; they waitlisted 2 previous star students who both got into harvard, Yale, and stanford (and one of them to mit as well, the other an Asian male with the waitlist). Also applied for math, maybe will change it to applied mathematics.\n\nCMU: good interest essay, terrible interview (she was young and unprofessional, asked around her friends for knowledge about me before she interviewed), trying to get that thrown out. Applied for CS school and applied math as alternate.\n\nPenn: applied for m&t program (engineering Wharton dual degree) with regular EE as a back-up. Skype Interview cut short after m&t alum had personal issue to deal with, only 20 min. Was somewhat awkward. Decent essays.\n\nDuke: ok essay, solid interview. Applied for math in trinity.\n\nColumbia: applied for applied math in engineering. Only ok essays, no interview. Usually takes 2-3 per year from my HS, none so far.\n\nCornell: good essay I thought, applied to EE, no interview. Will visit againnext week to show interest and see a class. Really hope to get in, they are supposed to like upstate ny and take about 20-30+ kids a year from my school, and the average gpa for once is lower than mine. Here I hope they don't think I will lower their yield-rate as I think it is unlikely I would.\n\nPlease see next post for some more schools and post Admit, waitlist, or rejection predictions, not a chance of reach,  math, safety.

However, I think that in my case explaining some icky grades Freshman and Sophomore year might help when it comes to my reach school (I am a Senior.)\n\nMy father has been incarcerated on and off throughout my life, and after being gone for a few years, he returned my Freshman year. His return stemmed a lot of drama within the family (my parents are divorced, so it was a matter of custody agreements, etc.) and through worrying about what was going to happen and having my parents being too preoccupied to pay attention to what was going on in school, I slipped into a depression and as a result, I let my grades go. My GPA is not at all a reflection of my potential or who I am as a student today (I've done well Junior and Senior year thus far), and I would like colleges to be able to see this. I would post it in the extra box thing on the Common Application, and I would try really hard to not make it sound like a total excuse for bad grades, because obviously if I had just focused on school and hadn't let my family life get in the way, I would have gotten the grades that I'm getting now! However, I just think it's less risky to post something like this, rather than have them wondering why my grades were so poor in the beginning?\n\nAlso, I thought it would be better to post it in the \"additional information\"box, rather than ruin an essay with it. Or it could be included in a recommendation letter (One outside of school staff) ?\n\nOpinions? Concerns?\n\nThanks!

However, I do think that their predictions were harsher than it really was.\n\n1) CC'ers tend to focus a lot on your SATs (many of them seem to emphasize that you NEED 2300+), but I really think that once you get over 2250+, it really doesn't make that much of a difference (unless you have 2400).\n2) Many of them seem to underestimate people's EC's.\n\nThat I got a very likely email from Cornell, accepted at Princeton with aid, and waitlisted at Yale seems to me that the adcoms saw me as a slightly stronger applicant than the CC'ers did.\n\nBut of course, when the CC'ers rated my chances, they hadn't read my recs or essays (or seen my interviews for that matter), which could have made a lot of differences. Actually, I do believe that my essays could have made a pretty significant difference int he whole process, because I really tried to show different sides of me and make a lasting impression through my essays.\n\nWell anyway, with all this rambling, what I am trying to say is that while asking about your chances on CC can definitely help you understand roughly where you stand among the top applicants, you really shouldn't give up hope just because some of them say you have VERY average/slim/no chances at some of your schools. With your essays/recs/interviews, you always have a chance at making your dream schools =)\n\nSo good luck in the future!

On the chance that it might be helpful to one of you out there, here is my admissions/decision story.\n\nI began researching colleges in the eighth grade. No joke. I've always been incredibly enamored with college academics, life, and all that it means. Needless to say, I applied to approximately none of the schools I wanted to apply to in eighth grade (except maybe Stanford). I hadn't fully recognized my abilities by that time and I wasn't sure where I could go. However, starting research early gave me a definite upper hand. By the time senior year rolled around, I knew the admissions process forward and backward. I, not our overworked public school counselors (who knew only about our state schools) was the go to for any sort of college question. I was able to navigate the system on my own. It was nice.\n\nI was still compiling my application list as I applied. I don't think that I ever completely finalized it until around December. It's a good thing I write fast and well. In the end, I applied to twelve schools ranging from the safetiest of safeties to arguably the best school in the nation. I sent in applications to the following schools:\n\nCSU Chico (both of my parents went here and I was fraught with paranoia over being shut out)\nAmerican University\nLewis and Clark College\nLehigh University\nUniversity of Southern California\nUC Davis\nUC Santa Barbara\nUC Berkeley\nDuke University\nBowdoin College\nPomona College\nStanford University\n\nTo give you a sense of who I am on paper:\n\nWhite\nFemale\nCA\n\nSAT: 2120\nACT: 35\nGPA: 4.0 UW, 4.40 W\nAPs: 9 total including senior year schedule\n3 community college courses\n\nECs:\nVarsity tennis 4 years, 2 years captain\nSports Medicine\nScience Club, treasurer\nCalifornia Scholarship Federation\nWomen's Chorus\nChamber Choir\nHospital Volunteer 1 summer\nCommunity Theater\n100+ Community Service hours for Police Department, club wrestling, local theater\n\nEssays: 1 on how my dad's job (police officer) shaped my passion for law and justice and 1 on how music helped me get over my perfectionism. Both very good, highly commended by my English teacher\n\nLetters of Rec: 1 excellent from my AP Chemistry teacher, 1 good from my counselor (they have many students, letters are generic), 1 that I thought would be excellent from my APUSH teacher but which actually turned out to be horrible because she was an awful writer, credited me with things I didn't do, misspelled my name, etc (she actually really liked me and claimed to write well but that was obviously a lie - I didn't get to read the letter until after applications were submitted and I requested a copy for scholarships)\n\nHooks: Absolutely none\n\nAnd now, the results...\n\nI applied REA to Stanford. I probably did not spend as much time on my application as I should have, particularly because I had a hard time coming up with topics for my essays and there were so many supplements. I was deferred to RD. I was pissed but also elated - I wanted to know, but I figured that if I was good enough to get deferred at Stanford, I could get in at most of my other schools. I sent in an optional update with a few minor awards that I had won. I did not submit an additional essay. I was rejected. My school is sending three athletes to Stanford this year and it makes me mad to know how much more academically qualified I am. This rejection still kind of stings.\n\nI applied to CSU Chico in about 45 minutes. I received my admissions decision a few months later. I was accepted and was invited to apply for their Honors Program and various scholarships. I did not.\n\nI applied to American University because of the location (Washington, DC for a Poli Sci major) and because I knew I could get in. I did not apply to their Honors Program or full-tuition Scholars Program because I was lazy and tired of writing essays. I was accepted and received a $20,000/year merit scholarship anyways.\n\nI was attracted to Lehigh University because of its beautiful campus and amazing wrestling program (I don't even wrestle, I just like to watch it). I was fairly confident that I could get in and maybe even get a full scholarship. I was accepted and received around a 1/4 scholarship, no need-based aid. I was accepted into a program that would have exempted me from General Education requirements.\n\nI applied to Lewis and Clark College as another safety, this one in case I needed to get out of California as I was planning on doing. The campus was beautiful and I liked the proximity to my cousin. I was accepted and awarded $17,000 in merit money, no need-based aid.\n\nI was accepted at UCD, UCSB, and USC.\n\nI received an email in January from UC Berkeley telling me that I was admitted and inviting me to interview for their Regent's and Chancellors' Scholarship. In the spring I was told that I had been given the scholarship. I received an honorary amount of $2500 (for those who don't qualify for need- based) a year, subject to increase if I needed it as well as various other perks important to a public university such as priority registration.\n\nBowdoin College seemed like the ideal college experience - if not a freezing one.  I wrote a very cliche essay about how having questions is more important than having answers for their supplement. I was very happy to be admitted.\n\nPomona College was probably my favorite of all the schools I applied to (minus the huge prestige factor at Stanford). I loved the location, the surrounding neighborhood, the small community within the big Claremont Consortium. I wrote a somewhat controversial supplement.. I was rejected. Pomona was my first rejection and I hated the sympathy it got me. In hindsight, I've heard not-so-great things about it, so maybe it's for the best.\n\nDuke University was also in my top five, but after being rejected from Pomona I was feeling very disheartened about my chances there. I applied RD and Duke accepts a huge part of its incoming class from ED, so my chances were slim. I was absolutely elated to find out that I had been accepted. I visited and really liked it. I did not receive as much financial aid as I had hoped.\n\nDecision Time:\n\nWhen it came down to it, I found myself deciding between Duke (a prospect I was very excited about) and UC Berkeley (which didn't seem like such a big achievement because of the proximity and the number of people I know there). I visited Duke and fell in love with the architecture, the relatively smaller size, the sports, the name, the new culture. On the flight home, I was sure that I would spend my next four years in Durham. When I got home, however, I realized that I wasn't so sure about the distance and I didn't know if I wanted to spend the extra money on my undergraduate education. Some days I would wake up set on Duke, others I would wake up and want to go to Berkeley. I submitted my SIR to Berkeley the day before it was due. Turning down Duke was very difficult, but I feel that I have made the right choice. I will be double majoring in Political Science and Integrative Biology, singing in an a capella group, and hopefully getting a Sports Medicine Internship. It's somewhat helpful that everyone at Berkeley hates Stanford, too.\n\nReflection:\n\nI regret that I did not invest myself more in the activities I chose.\n\nI regret waiting so long to start my essays and editing them so little.\n\nI regret not reading over that darn letter of recommendation that was so horrible.\n\nI regret not applying to schools with better merit aid.\n\nI am very glad that I knew so much about the application process.\n\nI am glad that I asked for help in editing my essays.\n\nThere is not always a clear cut best answer, and that's okay.\n"}, {"date": "2014-10-28T13:36:24+00:00", "url": "http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/sat-act-tests-test-preparation/1700387-shockingly-disappointing-results.html", "messages": "\n                    I doubt that my daughter has checked her October SAT results yet, but they were amazingly disappointing - especially compared to her May results.

The only prep she had done in May for the SAT was the PSAT the previous fall, and whatever little prep her school did the week before that particular test. She did quite a bit of self study for the math section of the SAT in August (the rest of her summers are fully taken up with her extra curricula). She had hoped to nudge her CR closer towards 700 (previously 690). Instead she took a 70 point drop in CR. Likewise, despite all her math prep, she dropped 20 points from 610 to 590. Only writing increased by 50 points from 590 to 640. Ironically, science and math are her strengths (received a 34 subscore on the ACT science section, and currently has 100% in her AP calculus class). Her hope was to edge all her SAT scores up to make them a little more competitive.\n\nNow, I don't know what to counsel her to do when she returns from school this evening. She was persuaded by one of her teachers to apply to a very selective college on early decision. The teacher is an alumnus of the school at the graduate level, and is writing her a separate letter of recommendation. Her ACT composite score would have put her in the 25th percentile of accepted students there, even though it is the kind of college where test scores are not enough by themselves. So it was already a long shot, which I didn't encourage, but nor did I fight her on it, even though I shared my skepticism. Unfortunately the college now has all her SAT results, which we assumed would merely improve, not get worse! She hasn't even taken the subject tests yet since we had no idea that she would even aim for such a selective college (yes, we did run this fact by the college and they will wait on receiving those scores). However, given that she is generally a poor test taker, I don't have high hopes. Like me, (and I attended an extremely prestigious college outside the States) she isn't fast, but she can produce great quality if given just a little more time. And this slow processing speed was confirmed by educational testing, but due to her scores falling above the average range to superior, she doesn't qualify for the same kind of accommodations that her older brother received who had some major learning disabilities that initially gave him a CR of 590 which later went up to 710 with the accommodations in place. Her processing speed makes her 'average' even though all her other scores fall in the superior range. Her weighted GPA is 97.42. She will graduate having taken 7 AP subjects as well as all honors/college prep courses. This on top of dedicating the majority of her time to ballet (hence she really has no time for test prep - right now all she does is dance and study, eat and sleep - even for most of the summer - and not even the time to get her driver's license).\n\nSo I'm not sure whether to encourage her to drop the selective college application, and just shoot for the local public university, or even whether to simply consider taking a gap year where she can take a breath, and get herself into a better place for college entrance - i.e. lots of reading, test prep to make her more competitive, and just simply figuring out who she is and what she wants from life. Her dream has always been to be a dancer. For the first time she sees that this might be unrealistic for her - she is very talented, but her body type betrayed her. Her complete focus on ballet is why she doesn't have her ducks lined up like other students who have been planning for competitive admissions for a long while. At the same time, dropping dance after 14 years is going to be so very traumatic for her, I was really hoping she'd have some bright spot to look forward to in the fall of 2015. Her local public college doesn't quite do that for her, even though she truly loves to learn, especially the sciences.\n\nDo you think that the college would perhaps discount her low SAT scores, and simply look at all the other strengths? I kind of think though, that any college that is asking for SAT subject tests, has to place quite a bit of weight on what test scores have to say. Am I wrong?

I not only want to talk about how exceptional the experience at the state school has been, but to also emphasize how the outcomes for top students who choose the state school are certainly on par with any prestigious private school.\n\nFour years ago I chose a large state school\u0092s scholarship over several other large state school scholarships, several generous scholarship offers (ranging from 2/3 tuition to a full ride) from top-20 schools, and an Ivy League school. I ended up with the University of Georgia\u0092s Foundation Fellowship, casting my lot in with a school ranked a mere 20th among public universities and known far more for football than academics at the time.\n\nHere\u0092s what I got for my decision: I\u0092ve studied abroad in Dubai for a semester, taken a cross-country geology/ecology/anthropology roadtrip that featured professors lecturing at a different national or state park across the nation each day for an entire summer, had breakfasts and lunches with Pulitzer-Prize winning authors, conducted field research on political violence in Kenya, interned at the Clinton Foundation, researched on everything from World War II to terrorism to Nuclear non-proliferation to US Intelligence Reform, and took spring break trips to Bosnia, Florence, and Washington DC. All of this was fully funded by the Fellowship in addition to tuition, room, board, and books every year.\n\nI was also a finalist for a major national scholarship this year thanks largely to the hard work of the people in UGA\u0092s Honors program who helped me through the 100+ hours I spent preparing my application and the many professors who graciously gave up their time to mentor me, guide me, and recommend me for both these scholarships and grad school. These professors, from a wide variety of disciplines including many far outside the realm of my major, were incredibly accessible; from lunches to office hours to just shooting them emails about a particularly interesting news story, I could always count on them to treat me with respect. I\u0092ll likely be back for another shot at these scholarships next year, again with their full support.\n\nBut those tangible benefits were secondary to the overall experience; even though I knew a grand total of one student coming into a 33,000 person university, I had a ready-made support group of 60 older fellows plus the other 20 students in my incoming class. If I ever had a question or needed advice, I could turn to someone who had likely been there beforehand or the wonderful staff at the Honors College who would literally put down what they were doing and help me out with anything. Having the top students in the school as some of your best friends was also incredibly intellectually stimulating; people doing research on stem cells, interning with Barack Obama\u0092s senate office, or putting together effective and lasting community activist organizations were also the same people with whom you snorkeled the Great Barrier Reef, explored the ruins of Petra, or cheered with at a football game. And although Honors students were great too, I also enjoyed getting to know and hang out with non-Honors students with a great array of talents in other organizations as well.\n\nI literally could go on forever about the benefits of the program, but I want to move on to some of the more concrete results as well since I know many parents are concerned about where their children will end up afterwards after taking these scholarships.\n\nNext year, I\u0092ll likely be entering a PhD program easily ranked in the top 10 in my field with the top fellowship the department offers and a gorgeous West Coast beach setting to boot. While I didn\u0092t get into every grad school to which I applied (and being from a relatively unknown state school may have something to do with that), I\u0092m confident that I\u0092ve been put on track to successfully compete with students from anywhere else in the nation in the job market and the larger forum of academic research in general.\n\nWhile my example is only one case study (the social scientist in me feels the need to note that I lack the data for large-N analysis), here\u0092s what the students from last year\u0092s class of Fellows at UGA ended up doing this year (note that this is a complete list; I have not excluded anyone):\n\nUVA Law\nFulbright Scholar\nConsultant/Intern at the Carter Center\nUT-Memphis Med School\nSelf-created nonprofit, Namibia\nEnglish Teacher, Spain\nIntern, Tampa Tribune\nMayo Medical School\nAmerican Constitution Society (DC)\nTeach for America (New Orleans)\nInternational Business, China\nSelf-created nonprofit, Ghana\nYale School of Medicine\nPhD in Finance, Vanderbilt\nHarvard Law\nMD/PHD in Neuroscience, Emory\nMA in International Policy Studies, Stanford\nRhodes Scholar, Oxford\nSuntrust Investment Banking\nStanford Law\nPhD in Computer Science, Georgia Tech\nPhD in Biostatistics, Johns Hopkins\n\nI also know of plenty of \u0093regular\u0094 UGA Honors students who ended up pursuing great opportunities around the world as well.\n\nSo in conclusion I not only want to echo the sentiments of many CC posters in the past who have advocated for taking the debt-free scholarship route at a lower-ranked school, but to offer a further and perhaps controversial opinion: For a significant portion of high-achieving students, these kinds of scholarships might actually help them succeed far more than paying full freight at a more prestigious school. I know for certain that I never would have been able to afford all the international travel nor would I have had the ability to work directly with faculty on research from my freshman year onward. While I may have gotten other exceptional opportunities at some of the other schools, particularly the other state schools, I doubt that I would have had any as good as what I got at a very \u0093average\u0094 state school by most official rankings.\n\nFor students and their parents considering a similar dilemma, know that your education is only what you make of it. Though you might face some unique challenges by choosing the state school route, the rewards can easily outweigh any disadvantages that might result. Think very carefully about what situation you'll be stepping into at each school you visit and make the best decision you can based on those unique circumstances. Good luck!

Up until about 11th grade I would frequently have anxiety attacks in my classrooms over things such as seating arrangements, desks not all facing the same way, and most notably handwriting. I just can't do it. I would spend the whole period focusing on one sentence when I was suppose to compose a whole essay. Choosing words wasn't the problem because I had no trouble typing essays. I just couldn't get over the fact that if I wrote the same letter twice that they wouldn't look the same. This made me struggle in just about every subject because I couldn't take notes, complete worksheets, or show my work in math. In 8th grade I began bringing my laptop to school, which helped a little bit, but not much because the curriculum was not technologically integrated. Finally, in the summer before 10th grade, my parents allowed my therapist to put me on medication to help with this. Its results weren't evident right away, and granted it took a while to find the right dosage, but by the end of sophomore year I was no longer struggling as much. The medication along with the help of an iPad helped me obtain a 3.8 my junior year, the best grades I have ever had. I am a senior now applying to college and I want to write about this because severely affects my transcripts, but my parents insist that it would be unwise to mention this because colleges will consequently \"label me\" and not admit me. My therapist and I disagree with this because just about every teenager is on medication for something these days, and I really shouldn't be penalized for something that  isn't my fault without even having the opportunity to explain myself. So my question is would colleges really look at something like this negatively, even more so than my 3.2 GPA?\nThis is primarily directed at University of Washington. I really wanna go there and I went and visited the campus last spring break. I met with and talked to a counselor in my intended major (industrial engineering) and I briefly mentioned this and she seemed to totally understand. This is especially important because I didn't discover my love of math until 10th grade when I started actually being able to show my work.

They are accepting more people than many huge state schools!\nI guess my point is that when more people get accepted decide to go to Tulane, then they would accept less people, and the acceptance rate would drop to single digit number like most of the ivies this year. By that point, we can definitely call Tulane prestige. But we'll have to work with the school to achieve that goal!

I need some help. So in the months before the March SAT I was studying a lot. I took practice tests (from collegeboard) every week and scored relatively well on all of them. My range was 2050-2160 on them so I was planning on scoring the same on the actual SAT. Anyways, March 8th came up, and I was ready to ace the test. After the test, I felt I did alright, but I knew Critical Reading didn't go that well, and I felt that I had made quite a few Math mistakes. I got my results yesterday, and I am still stunned.\n\nCR- 450 (450?! I won't accept that. I haven't scored that low since my VERY FIRST DIAGNOSTIC SAT. I usually score around 600 on my practice tests.)\n\nMath - 600 (This severely ticked me off, because I usually score around 710-780 on my practice tests.)\n\nWriting - 620 ( This also severely ticked me off because writing is my best subject. I usually score 750-800 on writing.)\n\nTotal score:1670\nThis score is not at all my standard, and it is sure as heck not where I want to be. I have no idea what happened on this test. My full online score report comes on April 1st so I'll look back and see what happened. Hopefully my score isn't an April Fools joke.\n\nI've started planning and I'm going to retake it on June 7th, but I also need advice on books. I already have the blue book, by the way. Oh, and my school got the SAT online course for students so we don't pay a dime.\n\nSo far, I've decided on getting the following:\n\nBarron's SAT Math Workbook\nBarron's SAT Critical Reading Workbook\nBarron's SAT 2400\n\nI really need advice on these. I want to score a 2200 or above. Yes, that seems pretty far, if you look at my March SAT score, but I know darn well that that is not my level.

I have merged these threads together, which is why you will see several similar answers from the same member and why the flow might seem a bit off. - FC, moderator\n\nI'm a freshman at a big public state school. Not huge but it's on the bigger side. I've always been pretty different for my age because I've gone through so many circumstances in my life that have made me much more mature than most people my age, plus I'm eccentric, and I'm really deep. My psychiatrist told me that I'm the kind of person who only connects with very certain people that are hard to find and I also don't get along with many people my age. But there are of course people my age who I connect with they're just hard to find. So my main struggle is not finding my place here because I haven't found those people who I click with. I do have friends though. But they're not what I'm looking for. I'm an introvert but I'm pretty outgoing. I've noticed people actually seem to like me and that's why I have friends on my floor who I got to parties with and include me in everything. And I've met a lot of people who have tried to hang out with me again. But I feel like I'm just getting a slap in the face on reality which is that most people my age aren't that mature and are mostly into the trivial things in life that I can't stand. I thought college would be much better than high school but it honestly doesn't feel like much of a change. And sadly I've been here close to two months and I still haven't found a single person who I feel a connection to. The reason why I'm so hopeless is because I do a lot out of my dorm that puts me in a position to meet many people. I really did put myself out there and stepped out of my comfort zone. I attended many different organizations before I decided on one I especially like. I go to parties a lot which I know isn't the best way to meet people but I mean it can happen. I've gone to different resident halls and hung out with different people. I always make sure I get people's numbers and if I like someone a bit I attempt to see them again. I attend review sessions for one of my classes every week. I go to study centers. I see a counselor every week now and started group therapy. But even my counselor said I am very different and he rarely meets people like me or people who he feels I could have a connection with. So it's not that I'm being picky or closed minded I'm really just that kind of person who only connects to certain people. I wish I weren't but I am. Even though I have friends here who like me and include me in everything, they don't make me happy even after I've gotten closer to them and we've opened up a lot to each other. It's not that I don't like them but you can like someone and not connect to them. I just know they're not who I'm looking for and I'm scared I'll never find it. I don't want to transfer and start all over again because I could get the same results. I'm scared I'm gonna run out of time and before I know it college will be over and I still won't have found who I'm looking for. What I value most in life are strong friendships with people who I have a genuine connection with who make me happy. I'm so depressed and scared I don't know what to do anymore. I've done so much to put myself out there and I've tried so hard but I've gotten nothing. Please help me I can't go on like this.

It is dated about a year and a half ago.\n\n\"A few days ago I blogged about the NY Times article which gave very bad advice to prospective college students\u0097that they should go to a less prestigious college that\u0092s a better \u0093fit.\u0094\n\nBut in the comments to my post, people wondered if more prestigious schools really conferred any benefit.\n\nA research paper by Stacy Berg Dale and Alan B. Krueger (1998) (link to pdf file) confirms that people who attended more prestigious schools earn more money. They looked only at students who were accepted to multiple colleges, so they were able to determine what happens if a student is accepted to a better school but attends a lesser school. From page 24:\n\nBased on the straightforward regression results in column 1, men who attend the most competitive colleges [according to Barron's 1982 ratings] earn 23 percent more than men who attend very competitive colleges, other variables in the equation being equal.\n\n23 percent is quite a bit of money, it\u0092s almost like getting two college degrees instead of one!\n\nThey also discovered that there was a benefit to attending a more expensive school. The more expensive tuition resulted in a lifetime internal rate of return of 20% for men and 25% for women.\n\nTHE MOST MIS-CITED STUDY EVER?\n\nWhenever this study has been cited, it has always been for the exact opposite of its actual conclusion. This typical article states that the study \u0093dropped a bomb on the notion of elite-college attendance as essential to success later in life.\u0094\n\nA third finding of the study was that when colleges were rated based on average SAT score, students who attended a school with a lower average SAT score didn\u0092t earn any less money. Everyone used this finding to say it doesn\u0092t matter what school a student attends. But what it really says is that the average SAT score of a school is unimportant, what\u0092s important is how highly \u0093ranked\u0094 it is. I suspect that in many cases, when a student attended a school with a lower average SAT score, they did so because the school with the lower score was actually the more prestigious school.\n\nThis demonstrates a persistent bias in which the media only reports what people want to hear instead of reporting the truth. Parents want to know that they didn\u0092t harm their kid by sending him to a state school instead of a more prestigious private school. Unfortunately, the reality is that sending your kid to a state school instead of the best private school he can get into does irreparable harm to his future career.\n\nSTUDENTS WITH HIGHER SAT SCORES EARN LESS MONEY\n\nThe regression analysis in the Dale & Krueger study had a coefficient for the person\u0092s SAT score and a second for the square of the SAT score. Based on these two coefficients, earnings peaks at an SAT score of 1100. People who have an SAT score higher than 1100 earn less money.\n\nI would find it hard to believe if I hadn\u0092t discovered the same thing myself. Seeing the same result in a completely different dataset confirms that I didn\u0092t do anything wrong.\n\nIt seems that the only benefit of high intelligence is that it gets you into a better college and graduate school. After you get your degrees, high intelligence is of no benefit in the labor market.\n\nATHLETES EARN MORE MONEY\n\nThe Dale & Krueger regression analysis also included a variable indicating if the person was an athlete. Those who were athletes earned more money. This also confirms my own findings from the General Social Survey.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nA kid who gets accepted to Harvard because of his athletic ability, even though his SAT score is lower than most other Harvard students', and attends Harvard, will likely earn far more money over the course of his life than an unathletic kid with a perfect SAT score who attends a state school.\"\n\nIts a very interesting article and at least for me confirms allot of my suspicions that regardless of your intelligence, attending one of the best undergraduate universities has an immense benefit on your career and earning path. Some of the person's statements I find a little extreme, but the general gist is very insightful. Thoughts?

I'm wondering if there are actual situations where multiple children/specific hardships aren't accounted for and result in a weird financial situation that results in the ivy college not meeting a reasonable amount of aid that would result in most other schools being cheaper?  Or, is this the usual answer to save face in the company of complete rejection from the ivies? I'm not asking this to put down anyone that says stuff like this (they might not have even been aware of how great ivy league financial aid is and saying it out of ignorance), but I've been hearing similar things so often recently I'm just wondering if these situations are as common as I hear or is it really only in crazy exceptional cases that Harvard becomes more expensive compared to the in-state public school? I really can't think of specific examples where this would happen, I guess I'm asking for some - does anyone know?

It won't indent for some reason.\n\n\n\nOftentimes, people have to deal with the demands of others. Whether at home or at work, everyone in some way has to deal with certain demands and expectations. Indeed, the demands of others do make people more productive than they would be without such pressure.\nA perfect example that illustrates this can be found in Upton Sinclair's The Jungle. In the novel, meatpackers in Chicago dealt with unsafe, unsanitary, and brutal working conditions. Because demand for labor was so high, workers were forced to work at breakneck pace just to keep their jobs. Employers exploited this high demand for labor by subjecting workers to long hours and demanding an inhumane pace. Although immoral, the demands of the employers in meatpacking companies did indeed soar the production of the employees. This example clearly illustrates how added pressure makes people more productive.\nAnother relevant example that supports this point is my current job at Dunkin Donuts. Although I consider myself a capable worker, I'll admit that when my boss is absent I have a tendency to work at a lethargic pace. However, last week I worked an 8 hour shift with my boss present. Fearing disapproval, I changed my usual routine of sluggishness and I worked quickly and efficiently. My boss was so impressed with my work ethic that day that he raised my pay from minimum wage. This personal example also illustrates how added pressure and demands can make one more productive.\nA third relevant example is the transcontinental railroad completed in the late 1800's. America had hit an industrial boom, and completion of a transcontinental railroad would signify the progressive nature of the era. Backed by strong public support and the demands of railroad companie, the Union Pacific and Central Pacific companies furiously constructed the railroad. Union Pacific working west from Missouri and Central Pacific working from east from California, the two triumphantly met in the mountain west region. Demands of the public and private companies led to the diligent, tireless work of the railroad workers.\nAll three of these examples clearly show how added demands spur productivity. When one has no pressure, it is easy for one to act lethargic and unalert. On the contrary, added pressure leads to more alertness and better results. Indeed, the demands of others do tend to make people more productive than they would be without such pressure.

There were also a record number of votes: over 50 Million.  How is that possible?  How could the USA be so evenly divided among the last three contestants.\n\nActually, the explanation is quite simple.  With the use of autodialers from computers (get yours today at dialidol dot com, which also has correctly predicted the loser almost every week, based on the percentage busy signals they receive during voting), and the popularity of the show, it's easy to predict that the usage of the voting lines is very close to 100% of capacity.  Thus, if the three contestants have equal capacity on their phone lines, the votes almost HAVE to be equal (within a small statistical variation).\n\nProblem is, when the usage is 100% on the lines, the vote then becomes meaningless.\n\nAssume that a \"line\" can support one vote per second and each contestant has the equivalent of 2400 \"lines\" of capacity.  If that capacity were used at 100%, that would mean 2400 votes per second per contestant, or 8.6 million votes per hour (3600 secs/hr * 2400 votes/sec).  The voting is open for 2 hours, so that translates to about 17 million votes per contestant for the night.  For the three contestants, that translates to a total of a little over 50 million votes total.

Websites, such as a petersons, which showed that all of the colleges on my list met 83%-95% of need and provided an average \"need-based grant aid\" of $6000 were apparently misleading.

That $12k in loans was the most generous offer I received.  The worst of the three colleges left me with roughly $17,000 a year in loans, $12,000 of which was unsubsidized, forcing me to pay 8.5% interest a year.  From this college, i've calculated that i'd owe about $80,000 when I received my bachelors, assuming that I paid it all off immediately when I graduate, since otherwise the interest would keep building up.

All of the Vocabulary lists and books claim to have \"the most frequently tested words on the SAT.\" But what is the truth? Which list and/or book really is the best?\n\nCC Fanatic and a host of CC posters did an amazing job of compiling a list of answers for the June SAT. Their list showed that there were 21 key Level 3 - 5 vocab words.\n\nA week ago I began a thread called \"Which Vocab list did the best?\" Thx to all the CC posters who contributed. I had no idea there were so many vocab lists and books. I have now reviewed 14 lists and books. Here are the results:\n\n1.  Direct Hits Vocabulary: 435 words; 13 hits; 33.3 words per hit\n2.  PR Hit Parade: 253 words; 7 hits; 36.1 words per hit\n3.  Rocket Review: 323 words; 8 hits; 40.3 words per hit\n4.  Barron's High Frequency List: 385 words; 6 hits; 64.1 words per hit\n5.  Barron's Hot Words: 396 words; 6 hits; 66.0 words per hit\n6.  TestMaster's Little List: 254 words; 3 hits; 84.6 words per hit\n7.  REA SAT Book: 600 words; 7 hits; 85.7 words per hit\n8.  SuperKids: 1120 words; 13 hits; 86.1 words per hit\n9.  SparkNotes: 1000 words; 11 hits; 90.9 words per hit\n10  Kaplan's SAT Score-Raising Dictionary: 1000 words; 11 hits; 90.9 words\nper hit\n11  Kaplan's SAT book: 500 words; 4 hits; 125 words per hit\n12  PR's Word Smart: 1505 words; 11 hits; 136.8 words per hit\n13  TestMaster's Big List: 2189 words; 13 hits; 168.3 words per hit\n14  Barron's Mini-Dictionary: 3, 500 words; 19 hits; 184.2 words per hit\n\nAs you can see, the top 2 were Direct Hits Vocabulary and Princeton's Review's Hit Parade. The Hit Parade's high rate of success was not a surprise. My older brother and sister used it and recommended it. Direct Hits Vocabulary was a surprise. I first saw it on a CC post. It is actually not a list. It is a vocabulary book with 10 chapters including prefixes, word histories and the toughest words on the SAT.\n\nMy best advice is to study both the Hit Parade and Direct Hits. The two have a total of 536 words that generated 16 hits on the June SAT for a rate of\none hit per 33.5 words.

What makes this difference? Of course people's own decisions and choices determines a lot about their lives; however environment is greater force that shapes one's life. Environment limits one's options to choose from.\n\nEnvironment first narrows down people's choices. Environment is what comes before making decision. For example, a student from very wealthy family may have more variety of universities to choose from than a student from poor backgrounds because poor student has to consider financial factors and this limits his options. And since which college one graduates from can determine his life, certainly it is plausible to say that the life of the student was affected by his poor backgrounds.\n\nComparing a child in U.S. and one in Somalia makes this idea more clear. A child in U.S. has rather prosperous and wealthy life and has more opportunity of education. However, in Somalia, most of the kids are deprived of good foods and shelters, and thus they are forced to join the pirates to keep up their living. What makes those kids in Somalia become pirates instead of civilized professionals? Their characteristics or their intelligence? No, it is the environment that determined their lives.\n\nIn conclusion, environment precedes the actual decision making, often narrowing down our scope of choices; decision making is just choosing within the boundary of environment. Thus, environment plays greater role in shaping one\u0092s life.

It feels unusual and wonderful to write it because I\u0092ve never acknowledged it before.  Being part of the last bastion of widely and openly discriminated group of people hasn\u0092t been a cup of tea; however, I wouldn\u0092t want to be heterosexual.  I wouldn\u0092t understand my enemy: oppression.\n\n\u0093The way to rid Africa of AIDS is to let them kill themselves,\u0094 my father says as the presidential debate skims over the topic.  My father comes from a racist 1960\u0092s South Boston and Marine Training that taught him to kill the \u0093Gooks\u0094 in Vietnam.  His mouth espouses ignorance.\n\nIf I weren\u0092t gay, I wouldn\u0092t be naturally inclined to believe my father to be irrational.  Label me a communist or an idealist, but I still believe in that elusive ideal \u0093equality\u0094.  I want it more than anything else, but I know there are greater inequalities in the world that warrant a more urgent response.\nBeing gay for me is not a choice, but being born in a poor country with no family planning institutions or contraceptive information is also not a choice.  Being gay involves oppression and prejudice, but when human trafficking or genocide is occurring, gay rights seem trivial to me.\n\nLast year, I realized I would never be happy if events like the genocide in Sudan transpire. Becoming a human rights activist is ironic insofar as my grandmother lived in Germany during the Holocaust and was, technically, a Nazi.  She couldn\u0092t have known what was going on in her very small town, but nonetheless has become part of the German public that did nothing to stop genocide.  In a way, I feel obligated to atone for that.\n\nI attended a discussion on race relations in Boston last year.  It was filled with both pretentious Harvard professors and homeless people stealing refreshments, but only one Jamaican man was worth hearing.  His discourse began with the words \u0093I\u0092m an optimist\u0094, and his is the only speech I can recall.  He spoke directly to me (as I was the only attendee not receiving social security) and said I would change the world.  I know I\u0092d like to.\n\nI hope to abolish race (lofty, I know).  Race is a means to no end where people are placed in uncomfortable boxes and stacked one on top of the other.  My Lilliputian brother thinks that all black people should die.  My 27-year-old single mother/ aspiring DJ sister likes \u0093black\u0094 music, but not \u0093black\u0094 people.  My 2 older brothers don\u0092t even have opinions, though I\u0092m sure if they exist they are akin to those of my father.  Color me black and call me a sheep, but don\u0092t call me a color or believe I\u0092m anything less (though maybe a little more) than human.  Throw semantics to the Yahoos; race does not exist.\n\n(Or, if you prefer obscure and non-cohesive endings, \u0093Go on! Get out! Final words are for fools who haven\u0092t already said enough.\u0094)\n- Dying words of Karl Marx\n\n\nFor Tufts, my supplemetnal essay is as follows:\n\nDorchester is stigmatized as the most dangerous place in Massachusetts.  Savin Hill, where I live, is labeled \u0093stab-n-kill\u0094.  In one way or another, these reputations stem from the truth; however, I could be an awful person if it weren\u0092t for Dorchester.  Some of the worst things about Dorchester have brought about the best things in me.\n\nI have 2 best friends and they are both within 5 minutes walking distance of my house.  They have both been robbed.  If my father weren\u0092t so crazy about locking our doors, I\u0092m sure we might have been too.  We actually call our house \u0093Fort Knox\u0094 \u0096 it takes 3 doors to get in.  Living in an environment where we need to have 3 doors really makes me desire a world where all the doors are open.\n\nPeople in Dorchester are robbed for a reason.  Other residents of Dorchester are poor and their only seemingly available option is to steal.  These people aren\u0092t innately bad.  They didn\u0092t choose to be poor.  These inequalities are so glaring to me that I can\u0092t ignore them.\n\nOne of my best friends, Alex, lives on Jones Hill.  When we walk up it late at night and pass by the playground, we often see cocaine transactions or used needles on the ground.  Dorchester has a major drug problem.  My own sister, Marta, was involved in drugs for a time.  As it turns out, Marta had a baby by a fellow drug user who has since left.\n\nAllie, her baby, is now 2.  I realize everyone thinks his or her baby is the cutest, but Allie is truly a marvel.  She has flaming red hair and bright blue eyes.  I have basically become her father.   I often have to watch her for hours on end while Marta leaves without notice.  It\u0092s not something I mind.  She never cries, she hugs and kisses me, and she mostly just watches the world around her.  My parents tell me that I was the same.  Allie reminds me of how beautiful the world can be.\n\nI\u0092ve been lucky enough to go to extremely diverse schools.  Being \u0093white\u0094 often meant being the minority.  It\u0092s an interesting position to be in, but not one I felt threatened by in the least.  At the Boys and Girls Club, \u0093whites\u0094 are, again, the minority.  As a result, most, if not all, of my friends growing up were African American, Vietnamese, or Caribbean.  I had much more in common with these supposed \u0093races\u0094, yet was different because of the melanin traces in my skin.\n\nMy fathers\u0092 racist beliefs are utterly different from my own observations.  I am forced to use my own logic as opposed to absorbing my fathers\u0092 views like a sponge.  If I lived in a suburb with all \u0093white\u0094 people, I would probably believe my father, but living in Dorchester makes being racist absurd, given that living here helped me realize race doesn\u0092t even exist.\n\nFor columbia I added a little bit from my tufts supplemental into my common app.  And I said I want to go to columbia because they offer human rights and are close in location to the U.N. Human rights watch, amnesty International, etc.\n\nFor NYU sunday afternoon, I wrote:\n\nMy room has 3 leaks in the ceiling and nor heat.  When combined with 2 snow storms, I became very sick on Friday.  As I had a swim meet to attend, I decided recovery would have to wait.  The, When approached about performing for BLS Idol as a special guest that night, I couldn't refuse; I'm known for outlandish antics (all in good taste) that could boost attendance where half of the proceeds would benefit tsunami relief.

The entire school heard by Monday, so when the event was produced onto video, everyone bought it and we were able to raise over 1,500 dollars for relief funds.  Sunday was spent sick and sore, but for a worthy cause.\n\nANd then I just talked about all the classes that I would take there and whatnot\n\nSo what y'all be thinking bout me?

Obviously, classroom exams aren't subjected to any formal testing or analysis like ETS does, in order to make sure smart kids aren't getting wrong an easy question because there's an error or something unintentionally misleading.  My older children were academically strong and could usually wade through the confusing, poorly worded questions.  They were also intuitive enough to interpret questions in light of their teacher's quirks and biases.  Furthermore, they paid attention to the details and were generally methodical and smart enough not to fall for the distractors when they actually knew their stuff.  They always wondered who DID fall for those distractors.\n\nKnow they know.  Their sister.  Youngest D will be the kid who won't have picked up on the teacher's idiosyncrasies enough to know that when she says X she really means Y.  Or D will solve the problem correctly, but pick the wrong answer.  She'll choose the first answer with the correct number part without noticing the unit is wrong.  I understand that sometimes confusion over a unit, like whether it's squared or not, is part of knowing the material.  But that's not the issue here.  It's being careful about the details.  Also, D gets easily ferhoodled.  She is the kid that WILL get tricked by the things designed to trick, even if they're not that tricky and would be an obvious option to eliminate for everyone else.  I think her brain can only focus on a few things at a time, so the least important detail could go out the window under stress.  When there's more time available, she can operate in more stages or increments.  A test situation doesn't allow for that.\n\nThis has made me more sympathetic to parents who claim their kid doesn't test well.  I used to think that was usually a rationalization, or else the kid had been pattern matching with the homework and lacked a depth of understanding.  But now I see that my D actually does know the material almost as well as her siblings did, but her test grades don't reflect that.\n\nBut this has also made me wonder, on a larger scale, whether classroom exams too often separate out who's smart and knows, from who's NOT smart but DOES know--right along with those who are indeed clueless.  D is now in a situation where despite several D's on tests, the teacher isn't worried about her.  He doesn't think she's really in any trouble with understanding the material.  That's nice, but what if this issue doesn't remedy itself?  She'll still fail the class.

The Committee on Admission invites you to complete arrangements for entering the University in January 2008.\n\nRice is fortunate in receiving applications from a great many students of unusual promise. Selecting from so many qualified candidates was a difficult task. Admission has been offered to a select few, like you, whose scholastic accomplishments and contributions to school, community, and family were significant.\n\nTransfer students must be registered in residence at Rice for at least four full semesters and must complete no less than sixty semester hours. Personal misconduct and academic decline in the 2007 fall term are reasons to rescind your offer of admission.\n\nYour hard copy admission packet was mailed November 16, 2007. To accept this offer of admission, submit your enrollment deposit by December 3, 2007.\n\n(Payment instructions)\n\nWe urge you to read carefully all of the information in your admission packet and to follow the procedures required for your matriculation.\n\n\nAfter we receive your deposit, The Office of the Dean of Undergraduates will send your residential college assignment. Transfer Orientation is January 3 & 4, 2008.\n\nCongratulations for the personal and intellectual achievements that led to your acceptance to Rice. If we can be of further assistance to you, do not hesitate to let us know.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n\n\nJulie M. Browning\nDean for Undergraduate Enrollment\"                "}, {"date": "2007-12-14T10:48:06+00:00", "url": "http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/johns-hopkins-university/432846-official-johns-hopkins-early-decisions-results-class-of-2012.html", "messages": "\n                    Okay, I'm in my TA prep hour and I have NOTHING to do but be on CC, so I decided I would be the one to take the fall for all of us and make the decisions thread. If someone else was dying to make this, I'm sorry. I didn't know. But, here it is! I hope this can hold some proud moments, alongside the disappointments, but overall I hope we can keep the process in perspective and not lose sight of our ultimate goals.\n\nBest of luck to all Early Decisions applicants!\n\n\n\n\n\nAs always, remove the spaces between the brackets, and pick the intro title (accepted/deferred/denied) that pertains to you and erase the other two. Also, fill in as much information as possible. Just as we used last year's decisions thread, next year will use ours so let's make it nice :)\n\nOH and since everyone inevitably freaks out about why they haven't gotten their e-mail yet, maybe include the first letter of your last name, state, and e-mail provider.

Given the brewha re: content of the test changing so much in 2009, we were quite anxious to see what it'd mean in terms of stanines/ curve for 2013. Seems only a few people applying to BS take the ISEE & instead take the SSAT. B/c of timing & capacity reasons, taking ISEE was our DC's only option if we wanted to get scores in by app deadlines.\n\nI know ISEE scores are compared with those of the last 3 years & that this year would be pretty telling because this would be the 1st year that there'd actually be 3 years worth of prior ISEE tests which used the revised format & higher difficulty level. Prior to 2009, the test had MORE questions (you get points for every correct answer so more quest. is better). It was apparently a good bit easier too. Yet those students who took the harder, revised version (starting in 2009) still had their scores compared to those who had taken the easier version. Hence, lots of 4,5 and 6's etc rather than 7,8 9's..\n\nSo, color me a bit flabbergasted today when I found that our DC's test scores were 5's and 6's. Even the Reading Comp which had come in @ the 90th percentile on every sample test & previous ERB taken thru school! Given the amount of sample tests taken at home & the relative comfort level our DC had before/ after taking it, we're puzzled. More importantly, wondering if anyone might have insight on these 2013 scores & how the schools are viewing them. Are they still looking @ them with a critical eye b/c of the problems/ changes ISEE encountered since 2009...or do the scores this year tend to garner more credibility?\n\nAs a rule, I know these tests are probably the least important aspect of admission but if these scores can & will be used as the \"tie breaker\" when deciding which student to admit...we haven't much ground to stand on, I'm aftraid.\nAnyone care to chime in?

Below are some of my previous threads and my final admission results, for a quick reference of my background:\n\nhttp://talk.collegeconfidential.com/china/1609820-urgent-help-am-i-really-doomed-to-lose-schooling-or-go-to-a-community-college-will-chance-u-back.html#latest\n\nhttp://talk.collegeconfidential.com/what-my-chances/1606501-help-me-predict-am-i-doomed-to-enter-community-college-or-have-a-gap-year.html#latest\n\nBelow is a summary of my app results:\n\nAdmitted: HKU(with a huge scholarship, currently attending); ChineseU of HK; Mcgill(with partial award), Baylor(with partial award), National U of Sg(with binding FA after acceptance);\n\nWaitlisted: Cornell, Vassar, Colby, Kenyon, Wash & Lee(all said no eventually)\n\nRejected: All the rest(I'm not that distressed with the outcome, since I'm well-aware of the need-aware policies for international students.)\n\nPerhaps my actual result may come as a great surprise to you all, but keep in mind that I'm an international student from China pursuing FA. In such a scenario, regardless of one's talent or the prestige of the institutions, all the schools become reaches or extreme reaches, so chances are pretty high that an int'l candidate can be rejected everywhere. Granted, there are people(or legends on paper) who manage to receive admission offers from reputed schools such as the Ivies with sufficient financial assistance, yet these guys belong to one of the very few - not just because of the quality of resume, but because of many other factors, or even luck.\n\nThough having lived in a city where educational agents do the utmost to advertise 'personal packaging' and the successful cases to Ivies with such assistance, I chose to handle everything in my own style, not so much for any sort of thriftiness(the commission involved could be $30- 50k sometimes) as for my integrity that I ought to endeavor for entry to top universities by devising my own extracurriculars and embracing my own ideas. And thus I worked by myself only throughout the process, without ANY HELP FROM THE EXTERNAL AGENTS - from my band at school to my experiences in one of the top Chinese National Youth Scientist Conferences, I overcame many barriers and eventually won many awards. Even if I had reapt nothing in the process, I still would have cherished these precious memories, for just as we all applaud to those who can't win the champion in a marathon, so we should all cheer for the process rather than the glittering offer letters.\n\nAnd then I waited for offers, feeling a sense in limbo occasionally yet often have no time to stew over trifling worries as I looked forward to the Intel ISEF as a part of Chinese delegation. Days, weeks, and months had gradually passed when, at the end of March this year, all the decision letters from US flew into my email and mail box. Waitlists. Rejections. The harsh reality loomed in front of me - with 90% of Chinese applicants willing to pay full-ride(even by selling their family flats) to go to virtually EVERY more or less famed school, FA candidates like me stand nearly no chance to win.\n\nBut I have my concerns. I should not rely on resources on family too much, because I'm the person who is going to shape my future. Those who see the Chinese kids riding on fancy Falarris or spending money like a genuine 'tuhao' do not understand many aspiring independent Chinese candidates, who strive for the best because we know our responsibilities in our family, who would stay true to ourselves when lured by agents devising all the nice-looking activities that make up a 'shiny' resume,who always remain original even when external agents produce batches and batches of students to good schools. Those wanting an easy ride by paying huge sums from family assets of $$ to agents and schools, we all fondly believe, will bear the responsibility that they should shoulder in the future.\n\nWould my post seem kind of cliched? It definitely would, as so many high-achieving international guys had aired their views from a wide array of outstanding schools. However, I still would like to share with you my ideas and thought, because I think whatever is real demands no embellishment, whether at Harvard, Yale or anywhere else. Wish all the studious candidates good luck, and hope that my comments can serve as motivation for you guys(esp. Chinese DIY candidates) to some degrees.

And the second problem is marked wrong for the same reason, the student made an array of six 4's instead of four 6's. Here is the most reasoned defense I've found of why the problems are marked wrong and I find it infuriating.\n\nTo me, the defense is idiotic and it even says that: \"If the teacher has already taught the commutative property of multiplication (the law that says a x b = b x a), then this is a fine substitution to make.\" Or, in simple words, the answer is correct but it's marked wrong, which means this isn't math but a reading quiz which ignores the basic rules of math; commutation is the most basic law of addition and multiplication and is what separates those operations from subtraction and division. That means, to me, this is an example of poorly written crap testing: if you don't want people to use commutation, then say that because the entire field of mathematics depends on using what is known UNLESS it is specifically excluded. This fundamental of math (and physics) is what makes it interesting and hard; to prove things, you have to show this is the only possible answer or you need to exclude all the other cases, even the absurd ones.\n\nMathematics works by picking away at the cases. A famous example is Fermat's Last Theorem: people first excluded n=3 and then a bunch and then an actual solution is derived using a bunch of weird techniques creatively applied because no one said the problem had to be limited to basic algebra but rather was open to creative solution. A more important example is the entire field of set theory: the entire axiomatic structure is designed to define the limits of what nature excludes, meaning a naive universal set. If they didn't state the specific limiting requirements of a set, then it could be anything even though that \"anything\" would contain paradoxical contradictions. In physics, a famous example is renormalization: if you don't think about the denominator going all the way toward 0, meaning distances become infinitely small, then you're just excluding all the hard or even impossible cases without a bleeping reason. Or in the news this past week, a possibly complete Bell's Theorem test: back in the 1960's John Bell showed that if you add up the probabilities from entanglement experiments then classical physics says the result would be this and quantum says it would be this. For decades people have been coming up with better and better tests even though each test shows the same result, that the probabilities always match quantum (and thus exceed what classical physics allows). Why bother? Because just like in this simple math problem, if it's not excluded, then you have to consider that it's not absolutely proven.\n\nTo me, marking commutation wrong is a sin and, in this case, a sin that covers up the original sin of not stating mathematically what was excluded. The importance of clearly excluding or including operations and characteristics is a far more important math lesson, one the teachers and writers of this test don't grasp. Sadly, the defense I link to also gets this wrong by citing Javascript: the reason \"4\" is not 4 is defined in the language rules that you learn, meaning it's specifically stated as an exclusion that while the value of \"4\" equals 4 the quote marks surrounding 4 define it as a string which may take other values and that is not the same as the value 4. You don't learn Javascript without learning that. In fact, you can't learn any computer language without learning that. It's as basic as knowing you can't switch order in subtraction.\n\nThe problem with this math test isn't the answer but the wording of the test itself. It tests what the teacher says the words mean: that \"using the repeated addition strategy\" somehow in this case excludes the basic operation of commutation. That isn't math.

However... I took the SAT Subject tests and completely bombed them, despite the fact that I got 750+ on my practice ones.

I could focus on my essays and keeping up my grades.\nQuestion: If I do this, should I retake both Bio M and Math IC, or only Bio? (Consider the fact that I have only 1 month, as well)\n\n2.

Just apply RD and retake subjects in December.\nPros: 2 month of studying for the subject test(s) that I'll be retaking. Definitely better scores.\nCons: Well... RD.

I got twelve with the e-rater but I've basically understood that it gives 12 for anything that's long enough.\n\nEssay Prompt\nThink carefully about the information presented in the following excerpt and the assignment below.People's lives are the result of the choices they make\u2014or fail to make. The path one takes in life is not arbitrary. Choices and their consequences determine the course of every person's life. All people, whatever their circumstances, make the choices on which their lives depend.\n\nAssignment:\nAre people's lives the result of the choices they make? Plan and write an essay in which you develop your point of view on this issue. Support your position with reasoning and examples taken from your reading, studies, experience, or observations.\n\nMy essay:\n\nChoice is what defines us and the lives we live. In other words, Life is like a huge sheet of paper with hundreds of thousands of dots on it; our choices influence how we choose to connect those dots from start to finish, from birth to death. Since there are so many different possible combinations, the individual choices we make differentiate each of us from one another.\n\nExploring literary examples for substantiating evidence, one comes across \"Fasting Feasting\", by Anita Desai. In this novel the reader is exposed to Indian culture and the lives that typical, decorous Indian women were supposed to live in traditional Indian society. However, the protagonist of the narrative, Uma, chooses to deviate from the norm, by eschewing propriety and indulging in her true whims and fancies. She ignores her parents\u2019 demands, and that is what allows her to, temporarily at least, catch glimpses of the \"tantalising inner world\" she so wishes to explore. That being said, this novel also allows to explore the opposite end of the spectrum. As the prompt rightly states, the choices one fails to make may be as impactful as the ones they do make. Take Anamika for example. She was the perfect Indian girl. She was beautiful, she had excellent grades and she was extremely adroit at cooking; to top it off, she was even accepted by Oxford. But the decision she failed to make was to actually go to University and live the life she deserved. After all, society decreed it suitable for an Indian women to stay in India and get married first. And she wasn't going to question Society.\n\nIn addition this notion of choices setting a path for you is omnipresent in today's society. Everybody can choose to live a normal life, get a day job, het married and carry on with their life. That is a choice in and within itself. However, there are certain people who decide to change their lives by taking executive decisions. Edward Snowden comes to mind at this moment. Let it be known that Snowden was a brave man- brave enough to be the first person to expose the inhumane reconnaissance activities that were being conducted by the NSA(National Security Agency). He showed the world that not only in US, but around the world, thousands of people's privacies were being invaded, illegally of course. However, he undertook this courageous task knowing the potential ramifications. He had to leave America, knowing that the government would try him as a criminal and is know taking asylum in Russia. This decision that Snowden made altered the balance of his life; and the important thing to note is that any decision that he makes everyday, no matter how small, will continue to shape his life, constructing out this undulating and constantly changing path that makes life so interesting and unique for each and every person.\n\nI cannot stress enough that choices are made or not made everywhere. In fact the decision to make a choice is funnily enough a choice in itself. Every little decision we make takes us a little further on our journey and every decision we take makes our lives a little more different from the ones around us. Therefore, we should make these decisions wisely, because once we make one, there's no going back.\n\nThanks :) "}, {"date": "2015-10-25T02:04:23+00:00", "url": "http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/texas-colleges/1823654-admissions-to-texas-a-m-blinn-team-as-well-as-utsa.html", "messages": "\n                    I'm a high-school homeschooled senior with a 4.0 GPA (fell to a 3.9 GPA the year before), with tons of extracurricular activities that benefit the degree I want to get (Mass Communications), have taken dual credit courses and made straight A's in those, but the only issue is is my SAT score.

If not, look at the comment written under and look at my accomplishments.\n\nThis is a genuine college admissions question. I am lacking in GPA but not in life experiences. I believe these experiences set me apart, but are hard to quantify and long if strung into a story of cause and effect. It's hard to make them appealing, but what sets me apart is learning from each and every experience.\n\nI live now realizing today is the first day of the rest of my life. If I am able to get a fighting chance into said colleges I will fight. If not, I will find another solution.\n\n\nBackground: I am an 11th grade, Indian (Asian-American) male living in Michigan who wants to get an MBA. I aspire to get into Finance or Management in UofM Ross, Wharton- UPenn, NYU, Columbia, Harvard, or any other Ivies (of which I know, have \"extremely low acceptance rates\", but upon looking and analyzing I believe the system does reward those who make an effort and care).\n\nBefore making judgements, the following is very long and doesn't deserve a read by any standards. But it would mean the world, and hopefully help others along the way.\n\nFrom what I understand, getting into a opportunity-laden college means showing I am academically sound and capable of time management while being a leader.\n\n\nThe Story:\n\nAt the moment I have a 3.33 GPA. It is my only limiting factor, yet it opens an extremely large hole of insecurity in me. I have worked through this partially and have a few accomplishments to note. But, it all requires a story to explain. It's fair to assume I won't get in anywhere prestigious but to combat this initial judgement it's probable I will get a 36 ACT, guaranteed 35 (I have received similar scores on an upward trend since 5-6 years), high chances of national merit (results haven't been released), and a similar SAT.  I have measured my IQ out of boredom several times and it is 130 (not high but far above average according to the bell curve).\n\nBy reaching for the stars I plan to land on the moon, one of Saturn's if I'm lucky, and I know to cherish my experiences all the same. To those who may comment prestigious colleges are not necessary, and neither is college in the first place: it is my belief that becoming extremely specialized in something I love will both satisfy me and give me something to eventually start a business out of.\n\nNot only do I love Finance/HR I love entrepreneurialism and working for oneself (I actually dislike the idea of Wall Street but using it for a purpose, all while becoming specialized and LEARNING  is what I want).  To those who complete this read, I truly appreciate the love and will consider every criticism.\n\nI have been smarter than most everyone I've known my entire life and I am decades beyond others maturity-wise, even with my brother of 21 (I'm 16). I don't have the ego one would expect the way I am talking about myself, but I must describe who I am. My knowledge comes from the sheer number of books I've read. Every parent I've had dealings with for both limited and extended periods of time outside my immediate family- interaction with them is both painful and limited- has seen I am years beyond my peers in maturity and look to me as a leader ( I could get a Rec. from one of them who was my team manager at one point but now I lead said team).\n\nELEMENTARY SCHOOL\n\nI was a very happy, motivated child (discounting my troubled family) whose relationship with books could not be described with the word 'love'. I was a bibliophile, and told everyone I could of my passion. I had been partially successful in a few math competitions in my elementary school days (AMC, Gauss, etc). I was recognized by my peers as the smartest in school (the same peers who now have extremely, extremely high chances of getting into colleges with great opportunities- Ivy League/ similar caliber).\n\nThis continued into 5/6th grade where I religiously worked (it doesn't count as work to me though) to keep the highest AR total,which was the way of measuring the amount of books a student read. I maintained the highest count for both 5th and 6th grade, the only years they were measured. I was enrolled in high school math. Not a big achievement but it speaks to my intrinsic drive, and more importantly the fact that I am in love with learning.\n\nMIDDLE SCHOOL\n\nIn 7th grade I changed my focus from being the first to finish a math worksheet or read a book to more on sports, being popular, and getting girls when my previous friends were too shy. I wanted to be the most popular Indian, as shallow as it may be- because of the attention I so desperately needed. I distanced myself from my previous friends who were too insecure or scared to be made fun of by 'cool kids'. I worked extremely hard to be the second fastest kid in my grade (the first was far too genetically gifted and molded from childhood for me to surpass), make the basketball team (and contribute), make and lead my travel basketball team to be undefeated, be one of two 7th graders on a 200 student track team to make it to an extremely  competitive track invitational,and be a great football player my first year of playing in 8th grade. I maintained good grades and tested out of another year in math (back then there were less than 5 who did so in a class of 500, the few others took summer school) and had big visions for my future.\n\nSummer of 8th grade my best friend moved and I honestly missed her- she was the most attractive/popular girl in my grade with an amazing personality that didn't care about popularity in the slightest (I may have had a little crush on her). I made many friends to offset the loneliness/ pain of poor family relationships but with my best friend leaving I suddenly lost what made me the happiest. I've had an extremely bad relationship with my father, who is troubled himself, since age 3 or 4. I ran for class president and came up short because I failed to appease the students who I left behind and didn't know me, but grouped me as a 'cool kid'. I believe these major events, along with other minor failures spiraled me into severe depression in which I desired to end my life for the past two years. Simply because I couldn't find a purpose. But, I have learned from each and every one of my shortcomings and experiences.\n\nHIGH SCHOOL:\n\nFrom a high A student (95-100) and having a 4.0 in basic high school math/language I turned to having a 3.33 GPA in my freshman and sophomore years (my grades have dropped freshman to sophomore). In my depression I wasn't motivated to test out of math classes so I could start Calculus in 9th grade, and remained in pre-calc (3 years ahead) and didn't have the motivation from my peers to succeed. I was alone. If you can empathize, my grades or academic achievements didn't really matter when I didn't want to live.\nI didn't see the importance of GPA, AP classes or not, when all that needs to be done to get an A is read a few hundred pages. It didn't motivate me other than quantifying my then little work ethic for academics. It's a path of diminishing returns when striving for extrinsic motivation. Being depressed demolished my intrinsic motivation. I'd watch motivational videos for hours and ask myself how bad I wanted 'success'. I'd read books by Osho, Robert Greene, and Ralph Waldo Emerson.\n\nWhile this is obvious, colleges need a way of scaling the general public and I have realized so. While depressed, I wasn't entirely underachieving. It's a fact now that I am the most popular Indian in school (even as I entered freshman year with all the upperclassmen included). I say this because I achieved what I set my mind to. However, as a freshman I stopped caring about popularity and the trivial enjoyment that's brought about by high school sports. Leaving organized sports increased the severity of my depression because it meant spending less time with others.\n\n"}, {"date": "2015-10-26T05:09:38+00:00", "url": "http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/college-majors/1824239-what-major-should-i-choose.html", "messages": "\n                    I know everything depends on high school GPA and standardized testings....but let's not talk about them right now.\n\nMy first choice of major is pharmaceutical science. I have a great interest in science and have a cousin practicing in the field as well. Under her influence and my interest, I want to study in this field as well.\n\nHowever, the problem comes that I'm not sure if I should really enter this field ( or can get in or not). I was terribly knocked by my AP biology teachers. In addition, unfortunately, i had an extremely harsh sophomore year when I took the AP biology. Things happened in my family so I barely had time to study. As a result, I failed my sophomore year. All my grades for math and science were below B or below. According to my knowledge, pharmaceutical science requires a large area of study on biology ( and chemistry I know). Should I still go for this major if I failed my AP biology??\n\nAnother choice for me is either architecture or interior design. I'm pretty sure I'm ok at math ( I don't even know how can I earn a B in algebra 2 honors) since I have A in both pre-calc and ap calculus ab. I'm taking AP physics 1 & 2 currently and I don't feel it's so bad compare to AP biology. In addition, I think I'm good at art, at least it's one of my favorite hobby. I've been learning art for more than ten years. Although I've stopped the lesson for two years, my drawing skill hasn't gone back too much. Since I like art, should i go for one of these majors??\n\nOR.........does anyone have a suggestion for the major i should go for instead?  by the way, I'm not sure for my actual gpa (haven't calculated them yet), but I know I have a GPA of 3.5+ for sure.

Parents are assigned to a different tower within RCS. Sibling orientation is also available for an additional cost for students with siblings. I think siblings have to be a high school freshman or older to participate. Linens are furnished for parents, but must be requested for students. BB is a good opportunity to measure if your student will be in RCS. Expect to find a twin xl bed with mattress, dresser, desk, chair in the bedroom, a bathroom with shower, and a fridge, sink, microwave, sofa, table, and chairs in the dorm.

The Chicago Maroon\n\nFor the first time this fall, almost every student in the College will have been admitted under Jim Nondorf, who took over as vice president and dean of admissions and financial aid in July 2009. During Nondorf\u0092s time leading admissions, interest in the College has soared; overall applications have more than doubled, the yield rate of accepted students who choose to matriculate has increased, and the College\u0092s acceptance rate has declined to 8.8 percent this year. Nondorf has also overseen a significant expansion of financial aid resources, including a nearly $40 million increase in the overall financial aid budget since 2009 and the launch of UChicago Promise, which converts loans to grants for all students with demonstrated need who attend the University from the city of Chicago.\n\nNondorf, who sang in the Whiffenpoofs as an undergraduate studying economics at Yale and still goes out to sing karaoke with his staff, sat down with Grey City to discuss financial aid, the College\u0092s increasing popularity, and the death of \u0093where fun goes to die.\u0094\n\nGrey City (GC): What are the challenges of expanding financial aid in a financial climate like the one we\u0092re in now?\n\nJim Nondorf (JN): Well, I think that the biggest issue is post, despite, the financial crisis, where a lot of schools had been very aggressive prior to that, perhaps more aggressive than they should have been, and then struggling toward coming back to meet the programmatic promises that they\u0092ve made, the University has really been thoughtful in that it continued to be moving forward. So I would say every year we have made improvements to financial aid in a whole variety of ways.\n\nYou always want to do more, and unfortunately it\u0092s need-based aid, not want-based aid\u0085. It would be great if we could just give everybody more\u0085so it\u0092s really choosing which policies or which things to do. And then you see what the actual results are. When you really model, you don\u0092t know how much something is going to cost because you don\u0092t know what the incoming freshman class is going to look like until you actually have a program, and then you can see what the results are. You want to do a lot, and you have to balance it with what you can afford.\n\nYou talk about what should we learn from our peers. One thing is there wasn\u0092t that kind of, \u0093Are we gonna be able to afford this in the long term?\u0094 for some schools, and now they\u0092re paying the price for it. We want to make sure that everything we do, we can continue to do in the future.\n\nGC: Where would you like to see financial aid go moving forward?\n\nJN: Some of our bigger projects are more mundane right now. We\u0092re moving online, and I think the big improvements this coming cycle are more back office things, which will allow us to really service the students a little better. So I think we\u0092ll be able to give more of the students\u0085at the time of their admission a more accurate and faster award. I think coming in and having to sign, you know there\u0092s a lot of things that current students have to do that I think we\u0092re gonna work on that area. For current students, there\u0092s a lot of stuff that we\u0092re trying to do.\n\nIn the not-too-distant future, I would like to look at the ranges for Odyssey, and that\u0092s certainly something I\u0092m going to be hoping to do in the future. I don\u0092t know in the how-distant future that will be.\n\nGC: You\u0092ve met recently with students who have been pushing for a \u0093no loan\u0094 policy. What have you learned from those meetings?\n\nJN: We all share common goals of making sure that we\u0092re supportive. Within that, we have whole sets of priorities and I think financial constraints that\u0085we\u0092re balancing. Where do we spend the best dollar? Even within financial aid, where do we spend the best dollar?\n\nI think that we are affordable, and we make sure that every student can attend here\u0085. Our loan average is way under everybody else\u0092s. It\u0092s $2,500 [less than the average] I believe. It\u0092s $150 a month for a student loan payment. I think with a University of Chicago education, you should be able to afford $150 a month. That\u0092s what I borrowed, and that was 20 years ago.\n\nAnd everyone should have skin in the game. Parents contribute, students contribute, the school contributes, alumni contribute\u0097I mean, everybody is putting something in to make sure that college is affordable.\n\nGC: Why do you think so much of the campaign has centered on the fact that so many of our peer schools have no loan policies?\n\nJN: Not that many, actually. Very few [laughs]\u0085. You know, I don\u0092t know. I think it\u0092s an easy thing to talk about. In some ways, I think the highly selective schools do themselves a disservice by making any kind of loan feel like a bad thing to the families. You take out loans when you\u0092re an adult. It teaches fiscal discipline; it teaches you [about] credit rating. You know there [are] a lot of good things about having reasonable, normal loans.\n\nYou know, I find that when I listen to parents, it\u0092s like, \u0093Oh my God, they should have no loans\u0094\u0085and we\u0092re like, \u0093It\u0092s a small student loan. Most of America grew up that way.\u0094\n\nWhere the jump goes are people that borrow $100,000 or something crazy. We would never advocate for that. No student should do that.\n\nI mean, what we do for aid is so much better than 90 to 99.9 percent of universities and colleges. We meet the need. There [are] not many schools that do that, when you really think about it\u0085. I mean, that\u0092s an enormous commitment, when you think about it. Sight unseen, we\u0092re saying anybody can come here and, based on the formulas for aid, we\u0092ll meet everything you can\u0092t afford, essentially.\n\nGC: In your op-ed in the Maroon, you wrote that at a University \u0093devoted to free inquiry\u0085we cannot let finances be a bar to entry.\u0094 What is the relationship between the University\u0092s mission toward inquiry and its attitude toward financial aid?\n\nJN: I don\u0092t know if it\u0092s just the free inquiry, as much as we want the best and brightest minds engaging in this free inquiry. And if we\u0092re only getting a wealthy family, wealthy students who can afford to come to your school, you\u0092re entirely missing a section of the population, but you\u0092re also missing different perspectives, which you need. You need people with different backgrounds, socioeconomic backgrounds, areas of the country to add to that discussion, and we\u0092re a very discussion-focused culture, and I think the more diverse we are in any way you can measure diversity, the better the conversation will be, the better solutions we\u0092ll develop.\n\nGC: Is there a challenge in doing that at a school that emphasizes the liberal arts, where students are encouraged to study learning for the sake of learning, not just learning so that they can have a lucrative career?\n\nJN: The things I like most about the University and how we stand out amongst our peers right now is\u0085I mean, I think many people say that they\u0092re focused on a liberal arts curriculum and allowing their students to pursue whatever their academic passion is. But on top of that, we layer what I think is the most robust career advancement kind of operations.\n\nI\u0092ve begun to describe [Career Advancement programs] to guidance counselors, basically saying, \u0093I don\u0092t care whether you want to be an English major or a classics major or whatever you want to be.\u0094 Even [if] you want to go into the arts, there are jobs\u0085. Really it sets us apart because we\u0092re helping students no matter what they decide to do academically [so] that they can have a career. Those careers can match their academic passions or not\u0097it doesn\u0092t really matter. If you can essentially help people do that during their four years, there\u0092s no reason you have to be an econ major or go work at Goldman Sachs to utilize your UChicago education and make money.\n\nSo the Metcalfs. That\u0092s a great example. When I was in school, I had to go work during the summer because I was on financial aid. And I had to make a certain amount of money, or else I wouldn\u0092t have the money for college. So that meant I either had to do some kind of labor job, or I had to go work at a bank or something. With the Metcalfs, with the arts, if you want to go work in the arts, we fund those Metcalfs. So even if you want to go and work for a nonprofit, there are nonprofit Metcalfs. Those companies can\u0092t afford to pay you, so the University picks up about half of the Metcalfs. That\u0092s kind of like a financial aid\u0085not from a socioeconomic standpoint but from a career standpoint, because we want to help students pursue their passions even if those passions aren\u0092t necessarily overly lucrative. And the way we enable that is basically making sure that you can get through your four years.\n\nGC: When you see the yield of accepted students and the number of applications increasing, and the acceptance rate going down, what does that mean to you?\n\nJN: When yield goes up and when applications go up, I feel really, really excited because it tells me that people in the United States are appreciating the University for what I think it is. I think in some ways maybe it was underappreciated, but at the very least now there\u0092s recognition for what an amazing place it is. I think they knew it was an incredibly academic place, and it still is. That it\u0092s also a place where we help people prepare for their career, where people come and enjoy themselves, perhaps not in the same way as at other schools, but they are having fun at Summer Breeze or Scav Hunt, or that zombie thing that goes on at the beginning of every quarter, which I find fascinating.\n\nMore applications [are] a sign to me that there is a growing appreciation for what we offer. A rigorous academic experience in a positive environment is highly sought after. I would say in yield, that\u0092s even more exciting because it tells me that the best and brightest who get into the University of Chicago and lots of other schools\u0085think we are the best fit for them. There [are] two reasons that I like that. One of the reasons is that [that] tells me that when you look at comparable schools\u0097the other ivies or West Coast, Stanford, or MIT, Caltech, all these different schools\u0097they think that we are just as good or better from a public standpoint. But it also tells me that my admissions officers are doing a good job reading files and admitting students who are a good fit for our kind of education. You know, in many ways, it\u0092s all about the fit: the students who are going to make the most of a UChicago education, not just a highly selective education.\n\nGC: What are some of the things you hear in high schools now that are different from when you started?\n\nJN: Oh, gosh. Well, you know, I don\u0092t hear, \u0093Is this where fun goes to die?\u0094 that often, I have to say. The fun dying has died, which is great. Or it\u0092s being resurrected here [laughs].\n\nWhat\u0092s nice about us is that we\u0092re not the same as every other school. The kids who want our kind of education, who are rigorous and really love to learn, they\u0092re gonna get that vibe and they will apply, I think followed by we\u0092ll love them, and they\u0092ll accept. And the students who aren\u0092t a great fit, they\u0092ll know it too.\n\nI always laugh: People fly in here to Chicago, and they\u0092ll visit our northern friends up there [Northwestern] and us. And you can usually tell when a student has visited one and they left there early and came. Or [if] they came here fairly early on, you can tell: \u0093Oh, that student was probably happier up there.\u0094\n\nGC: Next year, all four classes in the College will have been admitted by you. How do you think the College is different now than it was when you started?\n\nJN: When all of the classes have been admitted by you as the dean of admissions, that\u0092s like a huge deal. Because then pretty much everybody you see you\u0092ve interacted with a few times before.\n\nAnother big thing is that there are more of you now than when I first got here. That had something to do with being slightly over-admitted the last couple of years [laughs]. I would say those are the big differences: There\u0092s more of you, and just knowing a lot more of you just makes it feel more homey for me personally, I would say.\n\nI don\u0092t think there are a lot of other differences in terms of faculty who love you guys\u0085. In fact, I get a lot of compliments about the quality of the students. Students seem as happy, happier even\u0085. I feel there\u0092s more energy.\n\nGC: The last few years, the yield rate has exceeded what was projected. What are the challenges of admitting a class but also looking at realistic accommodations for student life?\n\nJN: Because I was slightly over last year, I really shot high this year in my yield predictions. And of course we hit those yield predictions. I mean, I wasn\u0092t really predicting that number; I was like, \u0093Well, I\u0092ll take this percentage, and then I\u0092ll just take students from the waitlist because we\u0092ll never go up that much again.\u0094 And then we did. And a little more [laughs]. So I\u0092m hoping that a few students will take gap years over the summer, which they usually do. I mean, the yield has gone up almost 20 points in four years.\n\nIt affects the admit rate dramatically as well. So I\u0092m admitting about 1,000 less students than I would have admitted a couple of years ago, which is kind of a downer. Part of having a high yield is that you don\u0092t give out as many offers of admission.\n\nGC: Why do you think that admissions statistics get big sexy headlines, and then financial aid doesn\u0092t grab that much attention?\n\nJN: You know, you\u0092re right, and that\u0092s disappointing. When we say we\u0092re spending $100 million on aid for students at the undergraduate level, we should get more kudos for that. That should be more exciting to people. You know, the fact that we can only admit less than 10 percent of the applicants isn\u0092t as exciting as the fact that we\u0092re spending $100 million on the ones who are coming here\u0085but there [are] a lot of things about the media attention that tends focus on the negatives or the scary things, and not [on] the positives. I guess there could be one of those human-interest stories where there\u0092s a cat hanging in the tree, and then the $100 million doesn\u0092t sound very exciting. So I would say that\u0092s one of the big ones.\n\nBecause if you look at trends, our admit rate and our application changes are not that different from the tripling of the financial aid budget. They\u0092re all fairly significant and have taken place over a relatively significant, short period of time. I\u0092ve never really thought of it that way until just now.\n\nYou know what? I actually think we got enormous positive feedback and press around the UChicago Promise. Like that\u0092s an example of\u0085something we\u0092re doing that\u0092s costing a lot of money, spending a lot of resources on our home city, and that actually we did pretty well. I get actually stopped by random people. I wear Chicago gear around\u0097we like T-shirts around here\u0097and I\u0092d say once every couple of weeks when I\u0092m walking around the South Loop in my UChicago T-shirt, somebody is like, \u0093Hey, I just heard about this thing,\u0094 and that\u0092s really nice.\n\nGC: I wanted to ask you about UChicago Promise. Why did you choose to launch it in the economy that we\u0092re in when the school is already so popular?\n\nJN: Well, I think that it\u0092s a combination of things. One of them is that the economy is not so great. And when that\u0092s what you read in the paper all the time, if you\u0092re a student, or parents of students, you can be thinking that a place like Chicago is out of your reach. But the reality is that a lot of top-tier schools are very interested in these kinds of kids. So I would say that now is the right time to do it.\n\nThe reality is that we do a lot for the city of Chicago already, and I\u0092m surprised more people didn\u0092t know all the things we did. This was an opportunity to do something highly impactful and draw attention to the fact that it\u0092s not just that we\u0092re doing this, but we\u0092re doing a whole suite of things to help young people across the city.\n\nI\u0092d say the catalyst or the spark that really lit it was the Chicago Public Schools (CPS) teacher strike. It\u0092s a great example of why I have the best office in the entire country. I was away, I was gone recruiting\u0097I think I was in New York\u0097and I get an e-mail from one of my admissions officers who reads CPS, that says, \u0093You know they\u0092re on strike and the kids are gonna have nothing to do, and I\u0092m sure that the seniors are starting to worry that they\u0092re not getting any guidance for getting into colleges. Why don\u0092t we invite all the kids to come to campus? We\u0092ll do essay writing workshops, filling out financial aid workshops, and we\u0092ll do filling out the Common App workshops.\u0094 So we e-mailed. Literally they put it together in a day. And then we sent the e-mail out, and then the following Tuesday, while they were still on strike, we had hundreds of kids from all over the city come to campus and we essentially became the college counselors for all these students.\n\nAnd it was so well received and the feedback was so great; the mayor was so appreciative. We were like, \u0093You know, we could do more things like this.\u0094 We have a lot of expertise in this area, we\u0092re not trying to tell them all they should come here, but we\u0092re trying to tell them that they should go to college and that many of them will probably get into really good colleges, and really good colleges have a lot of money to support them in getting there. It\u0092s kind of a multi-pronged attack.\n\nNow we\u0092re running these counselor academies. They\u0092ve been incredibly successful, in terms of high school counselors coming to campus and doing training programs with them.\n\nMy favorite story of this one is\u0085doing the posters of the UChicago Promise announcement. I gave the admissions officers the day off and had them drive around the city and hand-deliver them to the schools. One of the schools, the officer was in there talking to the person at the front desk, and the principal overheard it and was so excited about it that she took the person into his office, and got on the speaker and essentially shut the school down and was like, \u0093I want to tell you about this exciting new program that the University of Chicago has just launched.\u0094\n\nIt\u0092s all good. You know, this one there\u0092s no hidden agenda. Even if they decide not to come. The nice thing is that we have seen a lot of really wonderful students applying this year, and actually every good deed should get some positive, and so my yield in Chicago was much higher this year. So we did a good thing, and there were nice results.\n\nGC: What have you learned about the University since you\u0092ve started?\n\nJN: Oh god, so many things. Probably the first one, which probably took the most getting used to, was the inquiry and discussion. Highly desired discussion aspects of the University, which I remember at my first staff meeting, covering one policy I was planning to review and change, and two hours later we were still talking about it. And I remember thinking, \u0093Well, I thought I was the boss here. Don\u0092t I just get to tell them this is what we\u0092re doing and we\u0092re doing it?\u0094 So I think that there is a discussion on most topics. And it does a review, although it is exhausting.\n\nI mean, I know a lot more about the University just from a historic standpoint, going to a lot of Dean Boyer\u0092s presentations and things and College Council meetings. I grew up in Hammond, Indiana, which is just over the border, but I didn\u0092t know anything about the University of Chicago until I got here. And what I did know, I only knew from my admissions officers at other schools, and what I did know from that wasn\u0092t overly positive.\n\nAlmost everything has been a pleasant surprise. I haven\u0092t made it to, but I really want to go to, the Latke-Hamantashen Debate, but at least I know what they are, which is a step in the right direction. I\u0092m learning more than I thought I would ever continue to learn at my age. I mean, I know more about how the hospital is run, or the different areas. The nice thing about being at the University and engagement and all the discussion is that people tell you actually the details. You learn about what\u0092s going on. When someone is explaining to me about how this works, they\u0092re telling you; they\u0092re not just kind of saying, \u0091Oh, I handle this,\u0094 or something, so I\u0092ve learned a lot more about things that aren\u0092t in my area.\n\nGC: How do you stay engaged with a student culture that you\u0092re communicating about?\n\nJN: I\u0092m probably one of the two vice presidents of enrollment, probably the only one; that would be my guess. I read and I recruit. I visited Stuyvesant [High School] this year, and I visited Horace Mann, New Trier [High School], and [University of Chicago] Lab [High School]. So I get to know students. I read and I have a reading load. My reading load, actually because my area grew\u0097I had almost 200 applications from Stuy this year\u0097that I actually had read more than some of my admissions officers, because we had a lot.\n\nPlacement is important, in terms of where my office is. The door is always open, and almost all of the tour guides\u0097I don\u0092t know if you know any of them\u0097but they come wandering in and chitchat. That\u0092s nice. I go to functions, I go to games, I try to just be out and about. And for the most part, any student who shoots me an e-mail and asks, \u0093Oh, can I come in and talk to you about something, or give you an update on something?\u0094 I try and find time [for]. I\u0092d say almost once a week, I have a breakfast or lunch or a coffee or something with a student to catch up on something. I spend a lot more time on career things these days, if students are interested in going into this field or that field. I think there [are] just a lot of students. We probably have four or five times as many student workers in our office as we did before I got here. And so that is great, interacting with them at all times. I have dinner with the PSAC (Prospective Student Advisory Committee) board.\n\nGC: Is there anything about students here that has surprised you or stood out to you?\n\nJN: People here are witty. They are very witty and clever. And can do more work in a short period\u0097I actually think you guys are at your best when\u0097the more work you have, the more impressive the results, I think. You know, [for] my admissions officers who are alums, I find that in crunch time, amazing things happen. When they\u0092re less busy, that\u0092s when you have to go looking for them. And I think that\u0092s the way around the campus too. When you guys are in crunch mode, you guys do amazing things. When you\u0092re not, that\u0092s when you wind up in the Dean of Students\u0092 office or something [laughs]\u0097no, there\u0092s not much of that here.\n\nGC: You studied economics; you were in the tech industry. How did you get into admissions?\n\nJN: After I finished my time in tech, I actually moved to Florida, and started a charter school with my friend from Yale\u0085. I was loving it\u0085I taught social sciences, and I coached, and I taught music, which is what you do at a charter school.\n\nI will say that the problem with charter schools, some of them, is that the parents had very high demands that you would expect of private school parents, but charter schools don\u0092t have the resources of private schools. So it can be very draining on the teachers. So after a few years of that, I thought I would spend a few years giving back to my alma mater, and I contacted friends that I knew at Yale, and I said, \u0093You know, my background is in all these different things. Do you think I\u0092d be good at anything?\u0094 And they said, \u0093Yeah, try development or admissions.\u0094\n\nActually, my first job at Yale, they hired me\u0085in the major gifts office. So I did a year of fundraising, and one of the gifts I raised was in the area of admissions, and I got to know the dean, and the dean had this new job, had never existed before, called the director of outreach, and they were looking for someone who knew Yale really well, who understood technology, understood marketing, and I was a good fit for that, and so then they hired me to do that.\n\nAnd probably the best thing that happened to me was that in addition to having that role, I was also associate director of admissions. I had a territory, and that was my first exposure to reading and presentation and giving talks to the students, and after my first year, I was like, \u0093This is awesome. What a great job. I\u0092m going to do this as a career now.\u0094 So that\u0092s how I ended up in admissions.\n\nGC: And then you were at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI)?\n\nJN: Yes.\n\nGC: I know that one thing you\u0092ve said you were really proud of there is the way that you were able to recruit women. Tell me a little bit about how and why you did that.\n\nJN: When I got there, and this is pretty common when you get to new jobs like mine, the hope is that the president, or the trustees or whoever is hiring you, [has] goals for what they\u0092d like the student body to look like. In my case\u0085[Shirley Ann] Jackson, who was the president of RPI\u0085laid out a whole set of things that we were hoping to achieve, and one of them was to improve the male-female ratio of the student body. It\u0092s known for being an engineering school, in low times it was 25/75, 75 percent boys. Now that has negative impacts on social life, one can imagine, and we wanted more women engineers; I mean, there\u0092s a lot of reasons. Going back to that earlier discussion about the importance of diversity, you know when you look at an engineering problem and everybody is a male in the room, there would be other ways of looking at it, and that would [come from] those female engineers. So that was one of my goals, to get it to be in the 40 percent.\n\nYou have to develop communications that resonate with [women] more. Most of our e-mail or anything we do from a communications standpoint, we shop around to the students who work in the office and are like, \u0093Do you like this? Is this clever? Is this funny?\u0094\n\nWe had a lot of the\u0085women who were chosen at RPI working in the office, and they were helping us do a better job of talking about the school and appealing to young ladies who\u0092d be interested in this kind of education.\n\nThere, they used scholarships to appeal, so I would say it was a good year to be a female student\u0085and then you visit all the girls schools. You make that a priority for your admissions officers, so it\u0092s a whole host of things. You make sure that you, for admitted student days and things like that\u0085have enough programming\u0085. You make sure that they know that they\u0092d be comfortable on the campus.\n\nGC: What did you take away from that that you applied here?\n\nJN: I think what I probably took away from it that I applied is that if you are purposeful about what you\u0092re trying to achieve, you know, like to see other students from other parts of the country, you can do that: You have to create a plan. Things don\u0092t just happen. You have to actually think about how you want to talk about the school, what areas are you going to visit. All of these things are very achievable, but you have to have a plan and execute it. I could have sat at RPI and wished for a lot more girls to apply and come, but usually that\u0092s not successful.\n\nGC: Is there anything else from your experience at the charter school or in tech that you were able to apply?\n\nJN: In tech, probably a lot. I mean, I think we have a great system\u0085. It\u0092s also our outreach system, so it enables [admissions officers] to interact with students a lot. You guys may remember, when you got admitted, you did it online. The importance of social media. I\u0092m probably more comfortable with my admissions officers using technology in a lot of different and creative ways than some of my peers would be because I\u0092ve had a lot of iterations with technology over my time.\n\nGC: What do you do in your free time?\n\nJN: What would I do if I had free time [laughs]? Well, my siblings live in Valparaiso still; one\u0092s a fire chief, and the other one\u0092s a dentist. And I\u0092m actually a member of the Valparaiso country club with my brother who\u0092s a dentist. And so I like to play golf, [which] tells you how little free time I have. I love to play golf, and play eight to 10 times a year.\n\nI still actually have my home outside of Albany, and I like to go there and just relax\u0085. I spend a lot of time going to dinners, and hosting things; last night, Sunday, I hosted guidance counselors. This coming Friday night, I\u0092m hosting another set of guidance counselors. Saturday, I\u0092m spending the day with them. So that doesn\u0092t leave a lot of free time. Luckily I like the guidance counselors. It\u0092s not terrible; it just doesn\u0092t leave a lot of free time.\n\nI sang in the Whiffenpoofs at Yale\u0085and I occasionally go out karaoke-ing with my young staff.\n\nGC: I can\u0092t imagine what that\u0092s like.\n\nJN: [laughs] You would be surprised how many of the admissions officers are really good singers.\n\nInterview has been condensed and edited.

In fact, expert testimonies and clever anecdotes place coffee as the very pillar of the existence of our technological innovations. But brewing is an art, and for centuries, that art was confined to the knowledgeable few. As the population is expected to grow at an exponential rate while that of knowledge transferred by mouth of word is dramatically slowing, we must expect that eventually, the projected demand of coffee will asymptotically overshadow the ability to produce and brew quality coffee.\n\nIn preparation for such disasters of apocalyptic proportions, the Internet Engineering Task Force drafted a RFC (effectively a behavioral specification of a protocol on top of TCP) to ease the task of distributed brewing using traditional technologies. (http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2324.txt) Sadly, CollegeConfidential does not seem to support the Coffee Pot Control Protocol, also warmly known (by coffee lovers at least) as HTCPCP. Hence, we can not actively check for the status of brewers nor can we use the uptime statistics of RFC2324 compatible coffee pots to project expected downtimes of CollegeConfidential due to coffee related incidents. It is in my humble opinion that CollegeConfidential is squandering a huge opportunity for an innovative and community driven chance to get free coffee maintenance for the duration of business operation as well as giving a new meaning to the \"Cafe\".\n\n\nBug Specifics\n\nReproducibility: Consistent\nSteps:\n1. Using a RFC 2434 compliant client application, send a simple brew request to coffee://collegeconfidential.com\n\nFor reference, here's a sample implementation. Dependencies: w3 from emacs\nhttps://gist.github.com/1105982\n\nActual results: Connection over standard coffee port shuts down prematurely, leaving a distastefully grainy texture. Piggybacking on HTTP port 80 results in no response from apache, typical for unknown headers. Secured coffee protocol over port 434 also fails.\n\nExpected results:\nUsing List of HTTP status codes - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia as the foundation:\n\n20x on successful brewery, you may now send a GET request to stream the coffee.\n401 Unauthorize\n402 Payment Required\n404 Not Found - if no more coffee is left, this should be monitored by third party applications to ensure that the coffee pot is functional for as long as possible.\n406 Unacceptable - if the user asks for alcohol to be mixed into their coffee and the request is from less than 21 years ago, then gently scold the client on the potential dangers of underage drinking. This method ensures that the client is at least 21 years old. Also, if unacceptable coffee mixers are requested, such as bacon in your espresso, then 406 is returned until the user no longer requests for the espresso.\n408 Request Timed Out - that guy who always takes other people's coffee strikes again...\n418 I'm a teapot - Any attempt to brew coffee with a teapot should result in the error code \"418 I'm a teapot\".\n\nWith CC's support, users of the site may never need to remove themselves from their computer and hence can stay on CC forever.\n\nOn a more serious note, a past year had a final assignment to implement an HTTP compliant server framework where they actually had to interpret what 2423 meant.

Almost all of this, by the way, is lifted from Mark Bluemthnal's outstanding Exit Poll FAQ. For the long version, see over there.\n\n1. Exit polls have a much larger intrinsic margin for error than regular polls. This is because of what are known as cluster sampling techniques. Exit polls are not conducted at all precincts, but only at some fraction thereof. Although these precincts are selected at random and are supposed to be reflective of their states as a whole, this introduces another opportunity for error to occur (say, for instance, that a particular precinct has been canvassed especially heavily by one of the campaigns). This makes the margins for error somewhere between 50-90% higher than they would be for comparable telephone surveys.\n\n2. Exit polls have consistently overstated the Democratic share of the vote. Many of you will recall this happening in 2004, when leaked exit polls suggested that John Kerry would have a much better day than he actually had. But this phenomenon was hardly unique to 2004. In 2000, for instance, exit polls had Al Gore winning states like Alabama and Georgia (!). If you go back and watch The War Room, you'll find George Stephanopolous and James Carville gloating over exit polls showing Bill Clinton winning states like Indiana and Texas, which of course he did not win.\n\n3. Exit polls were particularly bad in this year's primaries. They overstated Barack Obama's performance by an average of about 7 points.\n\n4. Exit polls challenge the definition of a random sample. Although the exit polls have theoretically established procedures to collect a random sample -- essentially, having the interviewer approach every nth person who leaves the polling place -- in practice this is hard to execute at a busy polling place, particularly when the pollster may be standing many yards away from the polling place itself because of electioneering laws.\n\n5. Democrats may be more likely to participate in exit polls. Related to items #1 and #4 above, Scott Rasmussen has found that Democrats supporters are more likely to agree to participate in exit polls, probably because they are more enthusiastic about this election.\n\n6. Exit polls may have problems calibrating results from early voting. Contrary to the conventional wisdom, exit polls will attempt account for people who voted before election day in most (although not all) states by means of a random telephone sample of such voters. However, this requires the polling firms to guess at the ratio of early voters to regular ones, and sometimes they do not guess correctly. In Florida in 2000, for instance, there was a significant underestimation of the absentee vote, which that year was a substantially Republican vote, leading to an overestimation of Al Gore's share of the vote, and contributing to the infamous miscall of the state.\n\n7. Exit polls may also miss late voters. By \"late\" voters I mean persons who come to their polling place in the last couple of hours of the day, after the exit polls are out of the field. Although there is no clear consensus about which types of voters tend to vote later rather than earlier, this adds another way in which the sample may be nonrandom, particularly in precincts with long lines or extended voting hours.\n\n8. \"Leaked\" exit poll results may not be the genuine article. Sometimes, sources like Matt Drudge and Jim Geraghty have gotten their hands on the actual exit polls collected by the network pools. At other times, they may be reporting data from \"first-wave\" exit polls, which contain extremely small sample sizes and are not calibrated for their demographics. And at other places on the Internet (though likely not from Gergahty and Drudge, who actually have reasonably good track records), you may see numbers that are completely fabricated.\n\n9. A high-turnout election may make demographic weighting difficult. Just as regular, telephone polls are having difficulty this cycle estimating turnout demographics -- will younger voters and minorities show up in greater numbers? -- the same challenges await exit pollsters. Remember, an exit poll is not a definitive record of what happened at the polling place; it is at best a random sampling.\n\n10. You'll know the actual results soon enough anyway. Have patience, my friends, and consider yourselves lucky: in France, it is illegal to conduct a poll of any kind within 48 hours of the election. But exit polls are really more trouble than they're worth, at least as a predictive tool. An independent panel created by CNN in the wake of the Florida disaster in 2000 recommended that the network completely ignore exit polls when calling particular states. I suggest that you do the same.\n\n-- Nate Silver at 9:15 AM\n\nLabels: exit polls                "}, {"date": "2007-07-13T10:42:25+00:00", "url": "http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/parent-cafe/369117-measuring-progress-in-iraq.html", "messages": "\n                    Or lack thereof.

The story of an international applying to US-Universities! :D\n\nBut first things first, so here we go:\n\nI'm a german student, currently enjoying the 12th year of my secondary school experience, meaning that I still have to live through a \"13th\" year, since the german system requires you to attend school for 13 (actually 12 1/2) years...\nThis means that I won't be finished with school until June 2006, and I'm  going to apply for the fall semester of 2006. And here comes my first question (Ready? Then go!)\n\n1. My senior secondary leaving exam results (Abitur) won't be available until June 2006. This is far too late to be taken into consideration by the admissions people. Therefore, my teacher is asked to predict the results of my Abitur in the \"School Report\". But let's just say he/she predicts that I get a 1.2 (on a 1.0; best - 4.0; worst scale) and my actual results deviate from this prediction... up until what point can they deviate? E.g: Is a - let's say- 1.5 or 1.7 or even 2.0 still acceptable, or are they going to revoke the admission if it comes down to that? \n\nNext question:\n\n2. I am well aware of the fact that I have to hand in teacher evaluations. One from my guidance counselor, and two from other teachers. So far so good. Since I am the very first from my school to EVER apply to an american university, they're rather unsure of what to write or what not to write in order to present their opinions about me. Can the teacher recs be rather personal, or are they supposed to be formal? Are they supposed to explain the grading system? What is worth mentioning?\n\nYet another to come:\n\n3. Apart from my activities at school (founded the school newspaper, lacrosse, student government, tutoring and various minor clubs) I also have a range of other outside activites - especially because german student are not as involved with their school, as americans are. I've been working as a semi-professional actor, wrote my own play (which got published),annually hold various international seminars (about obtaining leadership qualities), won language competitions and so forth. I feel like my teachers, who are nice, but not that interested in me (or any other student for that matter) really don't know enough about me. That is why I'd like to hand in various other letters of recommendations (from my seminars, official certificates of my awards, evaluations from my acting coach etc.) ... to what extent is that possible? I know that academics are a key factor, but I also think that, since everyone applying to american universites has great academics, should try to make oneself stand out in some way, correct?\n\nAnd ... :\n\n4. Concerning my grades: I have absolutely no idea how to convert my grades to your GPA system. What is a weighted and unweighted GPA? And I'm not even sure if it's necessary? Our school does rank though and I understand that the rank is of importance to colleges, so I should include it into my school report, right? \n\nStill not done, but - relax- it's a short one:\n\n\n\n\nThat is all (for now) ;). Please forgive me for overwhelming y'all with this huge amount of questions. But every answer will be greatly appreciated! And even if you're unable/unwilling to answer any question, the effort you've made in order to fight yourself through this post, will never be forgotten :)\n\nThank you very much for listening,\n\nhave a great day, everyone\n\n\nYours,\n\nSeeYa Thomas :p "}, {"date": "2011-04-03T20:54:57+00:00", "url": "http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/sat-act-tests-test-preparation/1119482-rate-my-essay-plz.html", "messages": "\n                    I used the prompt from last December:\n\nAssignment:\nDoes the way that information is communicated today result in people learning less than ever before?

The exchange is meant to parody how users often find irrelevant results and get sidetracked when using the popular search engine Google. Despite Microsoft\u0092s implied criticism, Google remains by far the dominate means of finding information on the internet, and indeed we can all relate to the excursions into distraction that it often procures.\nWhile Google demonstrates how new technologies have caused trouble when seeking factual information, the lack of emotions conveyed through instant messaging shows how new technologies have damaged interpersonal communication. Mediums such as Facebook claim to allow users to \u0093stay connected\u0094 with their friends through short textual messages. In theory, this would augment our receipt of information. However, IM conversations often substitute phone conversations, and lack the subtleties of voice inflection and emotion conveyed through tone. Moreover, general laziness in typing causes IM conversations to be overly cursory limited to a series of \u0093What\u0092s up?\u0094s and \u0093not much. How bout you?\u0094s. Indeed, this new technology has actually served as a detriment to our acquisition of information.\nClearly, a discrepancy exists between theory and practice when it comes to utilizing technology to receive information. In theory, Google should be an easy way to find facts about whichever topic we please. In theory, instant messaging should allow us to easily communicate with our friends. However, if we wish to benefit from these technologies in practice, it is necessary that we change our methods of utilizing them.

I've been thinking a bit lately about the issue of psychological preparedness as it affects one's scores on the SAT.  There are some students who can do quite well on practice exams, but then drop significantly on the actual exam.  Then there are some students who do well on the practice exams, and then score as well or even better on the actual exam.  I'm interested in what sets the two groups of people apart.  What, exactly, enables the second group to handle the rigors of test-taking and come out unscathed, while the first group can sometimes crumble under the pressure?  I think a survey such as this is may really help those who are not as good at taking tests such as the SAT.\n\nNote that I'm *not* asking about how you \"studied\" for the exam.  I'm only concerned with the psychological aspects of taking the SAT right now.\n\nTo that end, I'm going to ask a few questions.  Please answer all of them:\n\n1.  What were your practice test scores (please also name the source of the tests) for the new SAT (or old SAT) just prior to taking the actual exam?  Was your actual test score close to (within 50 points overall) or higher than your practice test scores, or did you drop significantly from your practice test scores (more than 100 points combined) on the official exam?  What was your official SAT score?\n\n2.  How many practice exams did you take in total (say, in the month and a half before the SAT)?  Were they proctored (by someone else), or did you take them on your own?  Did you time the exams strictly?  What time of the day and what day of the week did you take them at?  Did you usually complete each practice exam all in one sitting?\n\n3.  How would you describe your state of mind right before the exam started?  During the exam?  What kind of thoughts were going through your mind during the exam (other than thoughts about the questions themselves)?  Did you feel confident?  Nervous?  Were you focused?  Distracted?  Were you calm?  Or freaking out?  Were you thinking about achieving a certain score constantly throughout the exam, or did you leave that all behind once you started the exam?  Did you feel or act differently from how you felt or acted at the practice exams?  The more detail, the better!\n\n4.  How did you feel you did right after the exam was done?  Did you feel good about it?  Did you feel just \"okay\"?  Did you KNOW that you did well (if you indeed did well)?  How did the actual results compare to your feelings and expectations at the conclusion of the exam?\n\n5.  Did you set a score goal for the exam?  If so, did you think about this goal much during the exam, and did you actually meet your goal?\n\n6.  Would you describe yourself as a good test-taker?  Have you always done well on exams (school AND standardized)?  Do you work well under pressure?  If you do think you're a good test-taker, how do you think you're able to consistently handle test-taking situations well?\n\n7.  If you actually did well on the exam and met your goal (and scored close to or higher than your practice test scores), what tips or advice would you give a student who is not as good a test-taker?  Again, I am concerned with psychological preparation for the exam (so I'm not looking for something like \"Read the Math section in Barron's\").\n\nThank you very much!

Barack Obama strikes a chord with me like no political figure since Ronald Reagan. To explain why, I need to explain why I am a conservative and what it means to me.\n\nIn 1964, at the age of 16, I organized the Dallas County Youth for Goldwater. My senior thesis at the University of Texas was on the conservative intellectual revival in America. Twenty years later, I was invited by William F. Buckley Jr. to join the board of National Review. I later became its publisher.\n\nConservatism to me is less a political philosophy than a stance, a recognition of the fallibility of man and of man\u0092s institutions. Conservatives respect the past not for its antiquity but because it represents, as G.K. Chesterton said, the democracy of the dead; it gives the benefit of the doubt to customs and laws tried and tested in the crucible of time. Conservatives are skeptical of abstract theories and utopian schemes, doubtful that government is wiser than its citizens, and always ready to test any political program against actual results.\n\nLiberalism always seemed to me to be a system of \u0093oughts.\u0094 We ought to do this or that because it\u0092s the right thing to do, regardless of whether it works or not. It is a doctrine based on intentions, not results, on feeling good rather than doing good.\n\nBut today it is so-called conservatives who are cemented to political programs when they clearly don\u0092t work. The Bush tax cuts\u0097a solution for which there was no real problem and which he refused to end even when the nation went to war\u0097led to huge deficit spending and a $3 trillion growth in the federal debt. Facing this, John McCain pumps his \u0093conservative\u0094 credentials by proposing even bigger tax cuts. Meanwhile, a movement that once fought for limited government has presided over the greatest growth of government in our history. That is not conservatism; it is profligacy using conservatism as a mask.\n\nToday it is conservatives, not liberals, who talk with alarming bellicosity about making the world \u0093safe for democracy.\u0094 It is John McCain who says America\u0092s job is to \u0093defeat evil,\u0094 a theological expansion of the nation\u0092s mission that would make George Washington cough out his wooden teeth.\n\nThis kind of conservatism, which is not conservative at all, has produced financial mismanagement, the waste of human lives, the loss of moral authority, and the wreckage of our economy that McCain now threatens to make worse.\n\nBarack Obama is not my ideal candidate for president. (In fact, I made the maximum donation to John McCain during the primaries, when there was still hope he might come to his senses.) But I now see that Obama is almost the ideal candidate for this moment in American history. I disagree with him on many issues. But those don\u0092t matter as much as what Obama offers, which is a deeply conservative view of the world. Nobody can read Obama\u0092s books (which, it is worth noting, he wrote himself) or listen to him speak without realizing that this is a thoughtful, pragmatic, and prudent man. It gives me comfort just to think that after eight years of George W. Bush we will have a president who has actually read the Federalist Papers.\n\nMost important, Obama will be a realist. I doubt he will taunt Russia, as McCain has, at the very moment when our national interest requires it as an ally. The crucial distinction in my mind is that, unlike John McCain, I am convinced he will not impulsively take us into another war unless American national interests are directly threatened.\n\n\u0093Every great cause,\u0094 Eric Hoffer wrote, \u0093begins as a movement, becomes a business, and eventually degenerates into a racket.\u0094 As a cause, conservatism may be dead. But as a stance, as a way of making judgments in a complex and difficult world, I believe it is very much alive in the instincts and predispositions of a liberal named Barack Obama.\n\n(\"National Review and NRO are America's most widely read and influential magazine and web site for Republican/conservative news, commentary, and opinion.

I just took the online practice SAT on the College Board's website, and it gave me a 12 on my essay. I was wondering how reliable the system actually is, and as such, have decided to ask what an actual human grader may have given my essay. Thanks in advance!\n\nThe prompt was \"Do people accomplish more when they are allowed to do things in their own way? Plan and write an essay in which you develop your point of view on this issue. Support your position with reasoning and examples taken from your reading, studies, experience, or observations.\"\n\nMy response is below:\n\n\"Due to society's incredibly goal-oriented nature, it often becomes difficult to make novel contributions to the world while operating within a pre-established framework. Indeed, true societal advancement can only occur through individuals' pushing the boundaries of what is accepted at the time.\nFor instance, the independence of research is the basis of new discoveries in the sciences. In the field of neurodegenerative diseases, for instance, much still remains unknown about the most fundamental factors that actually result in such afflictions. However, recently, I interned under a professor at Stanford, who, although previously criticized for researching a certain protein that was thought to be completely irrelevant to the disease ALS, has actually used that research to determine that, in the face of conventional wisdom, the misfolding of this protein is actually the most important factor that causes the disease. Moreover, in a review of literature, a type of study that is often considered inconsequential, the same group concluded that understanding such protein misfolding will provide a more basic understanding for how all neurodegenerative disorders affect their victims. This professor's group would not have made such an important contribution to determining how ALS is caused if they had not been granted the funding to research their independently developed ideas about the pathogenesis of the disease.\nFurthermore, if someone is motivated to achieve a certain goal, he will typically do so in whatever way he can. Often, the existing guidelines for performing certain actions are incredibly restrictive and allow little room for individualism, but if an innovative individual manages to find a way to improve on the existing system, he often outperforms his peers. One such inefficient set of rules manifests in the average person's sleep patterns. Everyday, after getting back from school, most students typically bounce between their homework and their social media profiles until as late as midnight, or even two in the morning. However, because I return home at seven in the evening, exhausted from a three hour long water polo practice, I typically eat dinner and sleep from about seven-thirty to four-thirty. When I awake rejuvenated from my deep slumber, I am able to quickly finish my homework by six-thirty and be ready to leave the house by seven, as the countless people who would distract me on the internet are still asleep and thus of no consequence. In the process, I can not only sleep longer than most of my peers, improving my performance in class, but also improve my real-life, face-to-face bonds with my peers, as I cannot rely on Facebook as a substitute for them.\nThus, when people are allowed to do things on their own terms, they often discover new ways to do them that improve both their own life and even the societies they live in.\"                "}, {"date": "2007-10-08T17:20:03+00:00", "url": "http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/what-my-chances/401742-that-dont-kill-me-can-only-make-me-stronger.html", "messages": "\n                    Anyone like that Kanye West song? :D\n\nAnyway...so I need a bit of feedback on whether my college list is reasonable or not.

I'm a bit OCD about test scores, if you haven't already noticed hehe.\n\n-Do my extracurriculars sound credible? I tried to be as honest with hours and descriptions as possible. I know some hours may seem a bit dramatic, but it's because my activities are spread out throughout the year. I'm not always doing all of them at the same time. If I did that, I'd probably die haha...  Also, I don't sound cocky or arrogant do I? I know wording is everything, and I've made mistakes in the past which I regret. There's a fine line between informing and bragging. =\\\n\n\nThank you SO much for reading, if you actually looked over everything.

As honestly as possible, we describe all our \"stats\": GPA, ECs, LSAT score, undergrad college (whether it's as specific as \"UC Los Angeles\" or as general as \"small co-ed liberal arts college in Northeast\"), etc. Basically, describe what many people do on this board, anyway. And we ask CC members for their guesses as to what law schools they feel we would be accepted at.\n\nThe difference being, in months' time, when the admission letters come in, we make sure to compare how accurate CC members really were. As it's an \"experiment,\" we observe (or more precisely, \"track\") responses (hypotheticals) and then compare them to the actual outcomes.\n\nIt's not an important thing, obviously. But I would find it quite interesting. And it might actually be, in some ways, helpful to other lurkers and/or potential law school applicants who use this board.\n\nIf anyone is interested in participating just for fun, leave feedback.

We always fear whether our decisions would turn out the way we planned them to. Although making bad decisions may not seem to always have positive outcomes, making bad decisions are better than no decision at all. Even bad decisions can teach us something of value. In Victor Hugo's Les Miserables, he introduces a character whose bad decisions early on led him to success in the latter. Not only in this literary piece do decisions play an important role but also in Leo Tolstoy's The Death of Ivan Illyich. In this novel, Tolstoy portrays a character who had not made any decisions of his own throughout his life; therefore, leading him to not have a successful life. Let us now take a look where a bad decision at first, actually resulted in becoming something positive in the end.\nIn Victor Hugo's Les Miserables, Jean Valjean is portrayed as a character whose bad decisions led him to eventual success. Early in his life, Jean Valjean was found guilty of theft. Jean Valjean was sentenced to prison, but after his escape a few years later had an epiphany. Jean Valjean now, with the help of his peers, was able to change the lives of those closest to him for the better. Although Jean Valjean had committed a theft, a remarkably bad decision, he had a successful life in the latter. Without making that bad decision and learning from it, Jean Valjean would have never helped so many.\nThe story of Jean Valjean presents us with a literary example where decisions are made, opposite to this is the story of Ivan Illyich where he had made absolutely no decisions throughout his life. In Leo Tolstoy's The Death of Ivan Illyich, Ivan Illyich is a character who never makes any decisions of his own throughout his life. Ivan always follows what others are doing in society- never committing to decisions on his own. Thus Ivan Illyich having made absolutely no decisions on his own, is faced with no success in his life. Ivan Illyich never had the chance to even learn from any of his mistakes throughout his life, he had always been chained down by what society expected from him. Making any decisions in Ivan's life would have resulted in some form of positive gain, whether it be the outcome of his decisions or having to learn from his mistakes.\nAll in all, even bad decisions are much more powerful than no decisions at all. Bad decisions may not always have positive results, but always can teach us something valuable. In the stories of Jean Valjean, his bad decisions proved to be something positive while on the other hand, in the story of Ivan Illyich, his inaction led him nowhere.\n\n\nTime Given: 25 minutes\n\nThank You                "}, {"date": "2012-03-15T01:17:34+00:00", "url": "http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/singapore/1303679-nus-ntu-chances.html", "messages": "\n                    Hey guys,\nLike the thread title states, I'd like to know what my chances are for getting a place in NUS/NTU.\nI've applied for Electrical and Electronic Engineering\nI'm not exactly that great in the CCA part, my participation is limited to school level so yeah.\nAcademically, I study under CBSE (Indian Board of Education)\n10th Grade : CGPA 9.8/10 [NUS said this doesnt really matter, but anyway)\n\nSAT 1 : 2010\nCR:620\nWriting:600\nMath :790\n\nSAT Subject Test\nPhysics 800\nMaths level 2 800\nChemistry 800\n\nand for 12th grade, results will be out in May, I'm expecting around 94-96%\nWhat do you guys think?

I just did not study at all for the essay because the first time I did not study either. But this time, on test day I was so worn out by the time that I wrote the actual essay that I just...blanked. Like panicked. It was like a page and a half of writing total, and my points were not very solid. my fourth paragraph was my conclusion and I was only 2 sentences in (2 very, very shaky sentences---kind of just restated the last sentence from my second point twice) and had written half of another sentence when they called time. So I had to stop after something like, \"In order for teens and parents to bond, they must recieve-\" and that was all she wrote.\n\nI am so mad at myself but I do not plan on retaking the ACT a third time. So what should I do?\n\nI plan to major in Poli Sci by the way...

But after spending some time at the  Berkeley board, I've become a bit worried about what I've seen. I was hoping you'd be able to clarify something.\n\n-What are the problems you have with Cal? Is it just the fact that those that are less motivated or willing to take initiative have a higher chance of falling through the cracks?\n\n-If so, why do you continue to tell those that are considering other schools, such as MIT, Harvard, etc., about this horrible atmosphere at Cal? Your posts have strong negative undertones, and although you do make some concessions, they will for the most part turn those people that are considering Cal with other top schools away. However, those that have been accepted to Cal as their best school will take Cal over UCSD or other comparable schools. This seems to actually result in the opposite of your intention; those with the best chance to succeed at Cal (those that have shown their skills and intelligence by getting into other great, highly selective schools) reject Cal. Those that have Cal as their top choices and probably at the highest risk of \"falling through the cracks\" go on to choose Cal.\n\n-If my goal is to eventually double major in business and engineering, while participating in undergraduate research, where will I most likely have the best academic opportunities, assuming I am motivated enough to seek them out? Penn has the Jerome Fisher Tech/Management program, which integrates business and engineering. At Cal, there is the risk I won't get into one of the two schools. At Northwestern, the integration is to a lesser degree and an Undergraduate business degree is not available. However, as far as research, it is most available at Northwestern but the caliber, in my opinion from what I have seen, is greater at Berkeley. I do not know of the research at UPenn. If you have the time, please correct the inaccuracies of my statements and fill in the blanks.\n\n-As far as atmopshere, I visted all three of the campuses in the past couple weeks and loved them all. San Francisco is an awesome city, so much to do, great food, great weather. Chicago.. how can you not like Chicago? I hear its cold. Very cold. Never been there when its cold. But at the same time, I've always lived in mild/hot weather and I wouldn't mind a chance to experience something different. (Yes, I realize both UCB and NU are in suburbs, not SF/Chicago. But the culture does carry over, and neither is eccessively far.) I don't know much about Philly, but I loved the UPenn campus and the surrounding area, or what little of it I saw. And the athletic facility is freakin' awesome.\n\n-Yes, I realize the Penn waitlist is hard to get in off of. But I'm still considering it as an option just because if you get in, you basically do have to go (assuming you make the effort to go and they let you in because of your enthusiasm.) I loved the place, but I just don't know where I think i'd fit best. They're all wonderful places. (I visted it because a friend got in, we were both visiting Northwestern, and I did not want to make the effort of getting in off the WL if I hadn't seen the campus.)\n\n-Sakky, please do reply to the paragraph about your intentions of steering those that may fall through the cracks away. I don't want to you drive away a potential future friend, genius, witty, motivated, etc. because of your negative posts even though they may have succeeded at Berkeley. I recognize you are an intelligent person, and I am sure you can see why I have an issue. I also recognize that you are trying to help people, but I think you need to make sure you make it clear that those that have the drive, intelligence, and will to succeed at MIT and make it far in the world could do so at Berkeley as well. Please do not take away the gifted at my potential University :)\n\n-Thank you for any information any of you end up giving me, and sorry for any spelling errors or grammatical mistakes.\n\nEdit..I changed the title a little                "}, {"date": "2006-06-20T18:26:01+00:00", "url": "http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/what-my-chances/204450-how-accurate-are-ccs-chances.html", "messages": "\n                    anyone who has been accepted into college and who has had a chances thread on CC post their actual results?\nThis should be itneresting!

In class, professor taught us a way of doing it and I'm pretty sure that's how everyone else in my class did it, as they were just coping the way we were taught in class and handed it in.\n\nBut because I had learned a lot about probability on my own, I did this problem a different way and I'm 100% certain I got the correct results and the correct conclusion.\n\nThe professor didn't understand my work and marked that my figures were wrong even though I generated the same conclusion. So I went up to him after class a few days ago trying to get him understand.\nUnfortunately it didn't end well. Before letting me explaining myself he was already so ready to start \"here's why you were wrong... blabla\"\n\nThe moment he started talking I knew for sure that he did NOT understand what I did and he did NOT know anything about probability himself. So I kinda forced him to listen to me, which he did.\n\nAfter he understood my work, he started saying \"Oh I never said your technique was wrong. It's just you didn't give me the figures we needed. That's where you were wrong.\"\nBut the question of this project is to propose that in a certain scenario, we should choose to do A or B. As long as I still concluded that we should choose A (which is the correct conclusion) and provided accurate mathematical calculations and figures, I don't see why he could say I was wrong just because I didn't prove it by the way he showed us in class.\n\nI knew that he marked me wrong in the first place because he didn't understand my work at all. I wrote out everything nicely on the paper with diagrams and everything, so I'm pretty upset when I got the results back and realized that I actually got a lower score than others for doing extra work.\n\nHe even said this to me: \"You only got 30 seconds to prove to a decision maker. Now, we've spent 15 minutes already and you still can't explain yourself well. How would you think your work was good enough?\"\n\nAnd that, made me SO MAD. Sorry for being so vague here but I'm pretty sure if I lay out everything here, whoever knows about probability will know I'm right. (p.s. this course isn't probability. But this question is.) And it wasn't that hard either!! That's why I felt so bad about it; it's like I was punished by being too smart than what the professor was asking for.\n\nIt also scared me that this argument with him could possibly affect my grades as in this class we were just doing several projects and he's the one giving out grades.\n\nMaybe it's a very common thing in universities for students to get into arguments with their professors. But as a minority female I'm just not used to it. I'm not used to being on \"bad terms\" with professors, and that makes me feel uncomfortable. Or did I do the right thing to defend myself, even though it didn't end well?\n\nAny thought would be appreciated.

I always wanted to go to a UC but my parents encouraged me to explore different private schools and basically get out of California. I got accepted to a school that's well known for its engineering and premed program, but the issue is that I'm a business/psychology major.  I attend a small school with only 4000 undergrad, and the majority are engineering/premed students who give a lot of crap to/make fun of  and belittle business students for choosing the \"lesser major\".  I don't feel like the environment at this school is welcoming nor encouraging towards business majors such as myself. That's the main reason why I'm so intent on transferring. The second reason is rather stupid, actually.  My university is basically a nerd school, and the kids who come here were very sheltered in high school. My high school in California had 2,600 students. For me, coming here wasn't a drastic change. For the most part, I'm a shy person who minds her business and focuses on her studies.  You can imagine how surprised I was when my roommate told me some of the rumors circulating that involved me. I tried to ignore it at first, but it's gotten to the point where I can't meet new people without them having heard some false information about me.  As a result of these rumors, I haven't been able to make any friends despite joining clubs and attempting to be involved on campus.  I'm not so much upset over my loneliness as I am over the level of immaturity within my class.  I did my best to maintain a good reputation and be kind to my classmates, but clearly none of it worked.  We're all supposed to be mature college students here but I feel as if I haven't left middle school (not even high school). I feel as if  I am constantly surrounded by negativity and it's bringing me down.  To distract myself, I stay in my room or the library and study.\n\nI gave this school a chance, and I pretty much hate it here. I know its only the first semester, but I am very intent on transferring to UCLA.  My plan is to finish my freshman year at this school, do sophomore year at a community college, and transfer.  This is a super bold move for me LOL but my asian parents are surprisingly understanding about it.  I received a sizable scholarship to my current school which made it possible for me to enroll here, but if I were to transfer to another private school without scholarship, the financial burden would be too great for my family.\n\nSorry for the super long rant, but can you guys post about your transfer stories (from a private to a UC)?\nAny tips or advice on what I should do?\nShould i just stick out the four years here?\nor just anything in general about the transfer process because Im super confused.\n\nThanks guys :) "}, {"date": "2015-10-12T17:07:33+00:00", "url": "http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/common-application/1819244-disciplinary-history.html", "messages": "\n                    I have a question about this section of the common app; the way this question is worded has me confused.

We are lucky to have UTKnoxville and TN Tech here in our state, but I am concerned about the Engineering degrees being able to 'move' if need be. What if he marries a girl who lives in CA..will they have any faith in a UTK, TTU, UA, UAH or other southern school's degree. (Please don't let me offend anyone..just curious here).\n\nI am an Auburn grad, and we have visited both UA and Auburn, but Auburn is super expensive now. Our family EFC is over 25,000 but we cannot spend more than $15000. If he can get a 33 ACT, then he would only get $6000. UA is more affordable but now that the COE add'l 1/3 scholarship is going away, it is not cheap. If he gets a 32 for UA, things will be better, but my question remains - is this a degree with weight that can travel?\n\nUTK is nice but still a very southern school. We have no clue as to its reputation. USNews ranks it somewhere but I don't really buy into that stuff. UAH might be good but its still very much a commuter school.\n\nInterestingly, kids around here who actually study for the PSAT or ACT are not the norm by any stretch. No one talks about schools outside of this region either. Bates, Cooper Union, or any other college beyond OSU might as well be in Egypt. :-) Of course, I am generalizing here as I don't know everyone who lives in TN but colleges are not a hotbed of conversation anywhere around here. Even kids from the private schools go to UTK and UTC, UK, Belmont, and David Lipscomb in droves. It doesn't seem that kids want to go anywhere else, I guess.\n\nIt would so cool if he could go to a school that would encourage his growth like a small LAC but get him going in his Engineering endeavors as well. We cannot, however, afford the better private Engineering schools, it seems. I looked into 3-2 schools but its a terrifying thought that you could lose scholarship funding by leaving thus having to pay for the second school.\n\nHe loves to debate politics, he's president of the Forensics team for public speaking, and he's just an amazing young man - sorry to brag - Typical EC's. Typical AP's and Honors classes. Hardest curriculum offered. Probably top 5% but our school allows non-honors to be in top of rankings so who knows at this point. He will do fine anywhere, I know. I just want to make sure we know about what all of his choices could be.\n\nHe went to a camp at Gtech this summer and loved Atlanta, but there's no way we could afford that. Rhodes is in Memphis, and I'm not sure how I feel about that inner city situation there.\n\nSo the question is how to do we learn about other schools that he might be a candidate for and that might be interested in him? College matching doesn't show any results for some reason - cost must be the factor.\n\nSomeone else said it best that we are too rich for FA but too poor to pay for college. Someone else said LAC's need young men to round out there numbers..most of those I have only heard of here...so sorry to say, but people don't talk about college in our rural town. **Side note**What's interesting is that other than two really smart kids we know who went to Centre and Case, no one else really leaves the state or strives for a better education. You would be amazed how many kids don't even take the ACT or SAT much less talk about college.\n\nThanks if you read this thesis here.

I know that by this point you must be working on your college applications and have maybe even submitted a couple. I was in your shoes a year ago, and I know just how stressful this process can be. I have been at Penn for a month now, and I have had conversations with friends about the stressful admissions process. However, after talking to people, there was one source of stress that members of the Class of 2018 shared. College Confidential. College Confidential can be a wonderful source of information. However, the constant reading of \"Chance Me Threads\" and Ivy League \"Results\" threads can make you feel bad about yourself and your chances of attaining admission to your extremely selective dream school. While I do not claim to be an expert about the ivy league after attending one school for a month, I have noticed some \"College Confidential Myths.\" There are some words of advice that are repeated again and again on this site. While a lot of the advice is helpful, there are some myths that cause applicants to feel insecure. I hope to shed light on some of these myths.\n\n1. It is not good enough to be very talented. You have to be the best of the best of the best of the best for admissions counselors to be impressed.\n\nYes, it is true that it is very difficult to get into America's top universities. Yes, there are many valedictorians and salutatorians at the ivies. Yes, students have won many competitions. Yes, everyone is extremely bright. However, do not let this hurt your self esteem. I remember that I was preparing art supplements for colleges around this time. The advice given on college confidential is that you need to be at Julliard level (or at least competitive conservatory level) to submit an arts supplement or for your musical talent to impress the admissions office. I am a serious classical pianist. I have devoted many hours to the instrument, however, school is my top priority. I know that while I could definitely play some of the repertoire for a Julliard audition, I simply did not put enough time into piano to compete. School was always my number 1 priority. Even though I know that there are probably Julliard level talents around me, musicians of that caliber are rare. They devoted their lives to music and probably applied to Julliard, not Harvard. I went to my first music lesson last week, and my teacher (who is a huge talent with an extensive resume) told me that I am very talented and that she is impressed. You have to be talented, but you don't have to be the best of the best of the best.\n\n2. You need to spend every waking hour on either schoolwork or meaningful and extraordinary ECs. Also, 600+ hours of community service is required.\n\nThis is also not true. Everyone I know at Penn is a serious student with passions outside of school, but there are only so many ECs you can participate in. There are only so many hours in the day. If someone on a Chance Me thread writes a humongous list of ECs, don't be discouraged.\n\n3. You need to have at least one awesome and/or unusual talent to be accepted.\n\nWhile this is very helpful and is probably true for a lot of people, some of my friends at Penn are just all around great people with many different talents and interests.\n\n4. While being talented in one skill is great, you need to be versatile with a wide set of skills.\n\nI saw one website that gave advice to students applying to ivies. It said that every applicant should participate in a sport, a community service effort, and an art form. I got in with absolutely no athletic ability and minimal community service. Yes, many students have multiple talents. You probably do too, but you don't have to do things you don't like or aren't good at for your college applications. While it is easy to be part of 8 different groups in high school. Most people are only committing to a few things in college. Also, you have to be admitted to most clubs and groups. If you aren't that talented, you probably shouldn't even try. Playing the flute in high school even though you aren't very good will not help you. You probably won't want to continue in college, and you probably won't get into any of the music groups. Adding meaningless things to your resume is not worth your time.\n\n5. You need to have a 2300+ to have a good chance at admission.\n\nI don't even know where this myth came from. Students on college confidential have been told that their 2250 is only mediocre. Huh? So many people would kill for that score. If you get a 2100 on your SAT, you are far above the national average. While a 2100 is not the most impressive score in the ivy admissions office, there is no reason to be ashamed. I don't know about other schools, but Penn's average SAT score this year was a 2190...I think. Even if I am a few points off, the average is not a 2350 even though college confidential might tell you otherwise.\n\n6. Most people who get into an ivy have started their own business, play an instrument at a very high level, work in a lab for 20+ hours a week (science journal publication coming soon), takes/self studies almost every AP, and participates in a laundry list of other activities.\n\nWhat I am writing is not a complete exaggeration. I have seen people on college confidential write chance me threads that look like this. I am sure that I will run into this type of student at some point at Penn, but they are a rare.\n\n7. Results threads are a good indicator of whether or not you will get in.\n\nI think that results threads are a good indicator that admissions are at least somewhat arbitrary and like an academic lottery. I would advise students to look at a few results threads. If you are far below the level of accepted students, maybe you should rethink the schools you are applying to. However, remember that this is the internet. People can write whatever they want. You have no clue who these people are or whether they are even telling the truth. On the chance thread, I once saw a student claim to get a 5 on an AP that doesn't even exist. People actually chanced him. Don't be gullible. If a college confidential poster seems to be far more talented than any other student you have ever seen in your entire life, something might not be right.\n\n8. Ivy league students are the smartest people ever. You will probably feel very intimidated. You will wonder whether or not your acceptance was a mistake. Being surrounded by so many geniuses will be very tough, but you will get through it.\n\nI'm at an ivy league school, and I feel like I fit in just fine. Am I the smartest person here? Probably not. Am I the the dumbest? Probably not. However, I fit in, and I love being in classes and organizations with so many talented and interesting people from all over the world. What could be better? I have gotten a few assignments back at this point, and I am happy with my grades. I think that people who feel dumb after attending an ivy are people who were very prideful and assumed that they would be the best. Don't adopt this mind set. You will be in school with all the valedictorians from around the world. You might not be every teacher's favorite anymore, but that is ok. There is no need to fear being an average student.\n\n\n\n\nI am in no way saying that admission to selective schools is easy. I definitely received my rejection letters in March. All I am saying is that some of the advice on college confidential might not be true in all cases. If you feel intimidated after spending an hour scrolling through CC, take a breath. Don't look on college confidential multiple times a day. You will be fine in the end. Please relax. I wish I had.                "}, {"date": "2011-01-15T17:08:00+00:00", "url": "http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/act-preparation/1071765-jeandevaches-guide-to-the-act.html", "messages": "\n                    Hey Guys,\n\nAs I mentioned in another thread, I'm currently a junior at Princeton (2370 SAT, 35 ACT, 234 PSAT) who ran his own test prep company in miniature this past summer and is thinking about taking this company full-time when I graduate. I posted another thread with my ideas on how test prep classes can be done well (since they can be done well) and asked for advice, but didn't list any of my strategies, which are a compilation of the ones I used myself, the ones I learned as an ACT instructor, and ones I've picked up randomly.\n\nGoing over the board, I noticed that there's currently a relative lack of ACT guides on this forum like Xiggi's and Silverturtle's guides on the SAT forum. One exception was FutureENTSurgeon's ACT guide, which I really liked for some things (English), but didn't find as useful on other things (Science).\n\nSo I thought I'd post my current method of teaching the ACT, which I think can be equally applied to learning the test independently. This way, I thought I could kill two birds with one stone: get some valuable feedback and maybe help a few people on the way.\n\nNote: It should be said that there are exceptions to every rule, and that no method is foolproof. My percentages are also approximate, and feel free to correct me. In the interest of space, this guide also doesn't attempt to go into every grammatical rule or every mathematical concept that is covered on the ACT, although I do cover those as part of my courses and tutoring, but confines itself to broad strategies.\n\nHere it goes:\n\nENGLISH:\n\n1. The shortest, simplest answer is usually the right one. This is because the ACT makers like to throw in a lot of extra junk to confuse you.\n\na. The literal shortest answer (fewest words) is right about 70% of the time. So it's not foolproof and not appropriate as a cure-all for someone who's shooting for a high score, but if you don't know the answer or are stuck between two, it's a great shorthand (since 70% is a lot better than the statistical 25% you'd get from randomly guessing or 50% you'd get from guessing between two).\n\nb. \"OMIT\" is right about 50% of the time (since nothing is always shorter than something).\n\nc. Don't add punctuation. Either leave it alone, change it (from a comma to a semi-colon, for instance), or take it out. Rarely do ACT questions have the problem of being too simple.\n\nd. If you can't understand what an answer choice is saying, it's probably wrong. A lot of people see an answer choice with a lot of words and punctuation and think \"Wow, that looks so complicated and smart. I can't even read it. It must be right.\" Give yourself more credit. You've read and understood a lot of edited, correct English getting up to this point in your life. If you can't understand it or have to read the answer choice three times to understand it, it's probably wrong.\n\ne. If an answer choice says the same thing twice or mentions something you think is completely unnecessary and off-topic, it's probably wrong for reasons of redundancy and irrelevancy, respectively. This will also fall under the \"shortest and simplest\" rule since the shortest and simplest answer will get rid of unnecessary things like this.\n\n2. If an answer choice is in the passive voice, it's wrong.\n\na. The grammatical definition of the passive voice is a sentence where the object (recipient of the verb; the one being taught, spoken to, written on, etc.) comes before the subject (the actor of the verb; the one teaching, speaking, writing, etc.). A sentence in the active voice, the correct way, will have the subject come before the object.\n\nPassive Example (BAD): The dog was walked by me.\nActive Example (GOOD): I walked the dog.\n\nb. While you will occasionally have to know part A for trickier \"passive voice\" questions, usually you can get away with a simple trick. Almost all passive voice answer choices have the word \"by\" somewhere in there. There are occasional legitimate uses for this word on the ACT, but they're few and far between. So if it has the word \"by\" in it, just mark it wrong.\n\nc. Be careful: due to its sometimes legitimate contexts, \"by\" isn't a word that naturally jumps out to us as wrong like \"ain't\" or \"I is\", and a lot of times we'll skim over it. Even after I teach my students this, they still miss occasional passive voice questions. Not usually because the method was wrong, but because they didn't see the word \"by\" since they were reading too fast/not being careful.\n\nd. It's also worth noting that this will generally tie in with Rule #1, since the active voice is usually shorter and simpler than the passive voice.\n\n3. Read answer choices \"aloud\" in your head and take advantage of your \"inner ear.\"\n\na. A lot of times, you won't be able to pinpoint the exact reason why an answer choice is right or wrong grammatically (\"Gee whiz, that's clearly a split infinitive\" or \"By golly, that's clearly a case of a superlative vs. comparative modifier.\"), but you'll be able to tell that it \"just sounds wrong.\" This is from years of reading correct English in books and magazines as well as hearing correct English on television. The inner ear won't usually kick in if you simply \"read\" it, so take the extra 2 seconds per answer choice and read it \"aloud\" in your head.\n\nb. Note: your inner ear isn't foolproof. This is due to our hearing the grammatically incorrect way in everyday speech. Common examples of this include the use of \"whom\" (which has a place grammatically even if people would look at you weird if you said this out loud) and the use of \"his or her\" rather than \"their\" (people almost always say \"their\" since it's shorter and easier to say, even though it's not always right).\n\n\nMATH:\n\nUnlike the other three sections, where you can improve by following a specific method or using broad strategies, there aren't any shortcuts with the Math. You improve in the Math mainly by doing practice problems, seeing why you got them wrong, figuring how to do it correctly and reworking the problems (this is crucial: take the time to rework the problem, rather than just thinking \"I got it\" and moving on), and then doing more problems. NO GUIDE IS A SUBSTITUTE FOR DOING MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF OFFICIAL ACT MATH PROBLEMS AND GOING OVER THE ONES YOU MISS APPROPRIATELY.\n\nThat being said, there are a couple of things that everyone can benefit from but not everyone uses.\n\n1. Do easy questions first, and don't shortchange them with time or effort.\n\na. All questions on the ACT are worth the same amount. But the ACT Math (the only section on the ACT to do this) also generally goes from easy questions to hard questions, with the first 20-ish being \"gimme questions\" (if you know the concept being tested, you'll easily get the question right), 21-ish to 45 or 50-ish being \"medium difficulty questions\" (they'll throw an extra complication into the problem, or try to trick you, but nothing too hard), and the last 10 or 15 being \"hard questions\" (the most difficult questions: many people won't even get to these or will have to guess on most of them; for you high scorers out there, these will be what make or break you).\n\nb. Because people are worried about time, they tend to rush through the easy questions at the beginning, making simple mistakes that could have been avoided, in order to get to the harder ones at the end. Don't make this mistake and miss out on easy points due to carelessness.\n\n2. To parrot your annoying math teacher, show your work! Write down the steps as you work them, draw out the graph, shape, etc. Use your calculator. You don't get cool points for doing everything in your head and you don't have anyone to impress. The best test-takers know they are fallable and plan accordingly.\n\na. The main advantage of this is it minimizes silly mistakes like forgetting negative signs, misplacing decimal points, adding 4 and 8 to get 48, etc. It's a statistical fact that the majority of questions people miss aren't because they didn't know the material, but because they either misunderstood the question or made a silly mistake. For high scorers, it's an even higher fraction since they tend to know pretty much all of the concepts being tested.\n\nb. It also helps conceptually. When you can see a line or shape in front of you rather than being distracted with trying to visualize it, it's easier to focus on what you need to do. When you have an equation written down in front of you, you may not know how to solve the problem, but you may know what step to take first, which will often lead you to the next step and the next step until you've solved the problem. If you try to do it in your head, you'll often just be stuck.\n\n3. This is a secondary tip borrowed from Princeton Review's \"Joe Blogg\" style of test-taking. If you don't know the answer to a question and the question is in the medium/hard section of 21-60, don't guess an answer choice whose number appears in the question. This method clearly isn't foolproof, but I'd say it works the majority of the time and is certainly statistically better than the 20% you'd get from guessing (since there are 5 answer choices in the Math section and 4 everywhere else).\n\na. This method works in practice even while unsound in theory since ACT makers usually choose to put those choices in there just on the off-chance you'll see a familiar number and jump on it. They also tend to engineer the problems with this in mind so that someone with this faulty way of thinking/guessing won't get the right answer by sheer accident.\n\nb. I'd also stay away from simply averaging the numbers found in the question and guessing that choice, for the same reasons as above.\n\n\nREADING:\n\nIn my opinion, Reading is the hardest section to improve in, since it relies heavily on soft skills like reading speed. It also tends to have the most genuinely ambiguous questions (even though the test-makers claim there is a clear answer to every question) and the most unforgiving curve. It was my own lowest sub-score on my final offical ACT (33 on the Reading), even though it didn't start out the lowest (that honor goes to the Science).\n\nAnecdotally, this is one of the two sections (the other being the Science, to a lesser degree) where students tend to have trouble with time even after good preparation. Unlike Math, where you improve in speed the more you prepare (since you'll be more practiced, spending less time on questions you already knew before preparation and spending less time stuck on questions you formerly couldn't figure out, now that you can actually work them) or the English (where people very rarely have time problems), Reading speed is limited in large measure by your reading speed, appropriately enough.\n\nThat being said, I have gleaned a few tips from my own experience taking the test, teaching it, and reading various guides on sites like College Confidential.\n\n1. Don't waste your time reading the questions before you read the passage. Not only does this waste precious time, but your retention of the passage will be worse when you do read it since you'll be distracted from trying to keep all of those questions in your head.\n\n2. Don't read too slowly, but don't hurry too much either, or else you won't remember anything and will have wasted the time you did spend. I'd say 3 1/2 minutes is a good benchmark to shoot for that strikes the right balance between time management and understanding the passage. If you're a fast reader and can read the passage faster and remember it well, more power to you.\n\n3. Questions can generally be divided into two categories: fact-based (answer can be found in black-and-white in the passage) and interpretation-based (answer must be found \"between the lines\"), with about 2/3 being the former and 1/3 being the latter. There tend to be an even greater proportion of fact-based questions on the more fact-based Social Science and Natural Science passages, while the split is tends to more 50/50 on the Prose and Humanities passages. In my experience, performance on fact-based questions can be improved, but performance on interpretation-based questions is pretty strongly reliant on your natural ability to \"read between the lines.\" Either you see it or you don't. Try not to worry about the ones you don't and focus on the ones you do.\n\na. For the reasons I've detailed above, the Social Science and Natural Science passages tend to be easier for most people, but not for everyone.\n\nb. If you KNOW you won't have enough time to do all 4 passages, I'd do the passages from easiest to hardest, based on your personal preferences. This is because it's obviously better to have time to do the one you usually get 8 out of 10 on rather than the one you usually get 4 out of 10 on. But if you usually have extra time, barely finish, or almost finish (1 or 2 questions left), I'd recommend going and ahead and just doing the passages in order, since it won't be worth the mind game you're playing with yourself.\n\n4. To find answers faster and more accurately, I recommend the \"key word\" method. A lot of people try to re-read the passage for each question and find its answer. Not only does this waste a lot of time, it actually lessens your ability to actually pinpoint the answer's location since you don't really know what to look for. The \"key word\" method is detailed below.\n\na. Find a \"key word\" in the wording of the question. Don't pick a word like \"he\" or \"is\", for obvious reasons. Also, if the passage is on wildlife management, don't pick a word like \"wildlife\" or \"management.\" The reason for both of these is the same: the word will show up in a lot of contexts not related to the question or the answer.\n\nb. Instead, pick a word that seems unique to the question. For example, say you have a question like \"According to the passage, what is NOT a negative externality of wildlife management?\" A good key word would be \"externality\". Note: the actual wording in the passage may be something like \"externalities\", but will almost always be something either identical or very visually similar to your key word.\n\nc. Once you have your key word, quickly skim the passage for that specific word. If you're looking for a specific word, it will tend to jump out at you, making it easy.\n\nd. Once you've located the key word, start reading a little before it (a couple of sentences) and read until a little after it. This is called \"being aware of context\" and the ACT-makers will often put the answer before or after where the answer's subject mentioned explicitly to make sure you're being circumspect.\n\ne. It's also worth noting that the key word may show up several times in the passage, and the answer may not always show up in the first instance every time. Don't give up if you don't see it, and don't waste a lot of time re-reading the same bit over and over if you've already followed part d.\n\n5. Correct answers tend to be moderate in both tone and belief. So if an answer choice could be viewed as offensive or extreme, it's probably not right. Buzzwords to watch out for include \"always,\" \"never,\" \"perfectly,\" and other absolutes like them. An answer choice containing those words probably isn't right.\n\n6. If you've done the strategies I recommend and are still having problems with time, I recommend trying speed reading, even though it doesn't work for everyone. There are many forms of speed reading, and it's difficult to explain in writing, but my best attempt goes like this:\n\na. People tend to read slowly not because they are inherently slow readers, but because they get distracted, especially with boring ACT passages. Their eyes lose their place, they start to think about other things, they slow down and then speed up artificially, and so on.\n\nb. To help focus the eyes, maintain mental focus, and enforce a certain reading speed, trace under the line you're currently on at a steady speed you want to read at. Don't make your pencil follow your eyes: that will just distract you. Instead, take advantage of the fact that our brains are evolutionarily wired to notice moving objects: your eyes will be \"bothered\" by the moving pencil and will be naturally drawn to it. To speed up reading, simply move your pencil faster.\n\nc. Don't underestimate the mental advantage of doing this. Doing this puts you in \"ACT mode\", reminding you why you're here and keeping you focused.\n\nd. I've had mixed results with this. Some people cut their passage reading time from 6 minutes to 3 minutes, giving them 12 extra minutes over 4 passages that they can now spend answering the questions. I had one guy go from a 21 to a 29 on the Reading using this tactic. More typical improvement is from 4 1/2 minutes to 3 1/2 minutes, bringing about an estimated 2 point improvement, with the other 2 points (my students' average improvement is 4 points) coming from the other strategies I've listed. Anecdotally, I'd say it helps about 60% of people. But if you're already reading at a pace of 3 1/2 minutes per passage or faster, or if this method just distracts you and slows you down, I wouldn't bother with it. There is no question that while this method helps most people, it does hurt some people, and you should follow your best judgment.\n\n\nSCIENCE:\n\nScience is probably the section least like the subject that bears its name, at least on the surface. In reality, it's less physics and chemistry and more \"interpreting tables/charts/graphs/etc.\" mixed with a bit of \"compare these two scientists/students/etc.\" as a Science version of reading comprehension.\n\nThere are three types of passages in the Science section. You do the first two one way and the last a different way.\n\n1. Data Representation (3 of these, 5 questions each): almost entirely charts/graphs/etc. with few words. Tend to be the most straightforward.\n\n2. Research Summaries (3 of these, 6 questions each): paragraphs mixed with charts/graphs/etc. Tend to revolve around several experiments that you have to examine in isolation and in comparison with one another.\n\n3. Conflicting Viewpoints (1 of these, 7 questions): two or three short passages written by \"students\", \"scientists\", etc. They all talk about the same topic, but have different stances on a key issue.\n\nHere are my strategies for the first two:\n\n1. Read the short blurb at the top of the page to get a very vague, general idea of what you're dealing with, and then go straight to the questions. Not only does this save time, but it reinforces the central theme of taking the Science successfully: the focus isn't on understanding the material, but on just answering the questions correctly.\n\n2. Don't try to understand the material beyond what you absolutely have to. It wastes time and will usually needlessly confuse you. The ACT makers don't expect you to be an expert on engines, pendulums, lightning, or God knows what (as can be seen by the fact that comprehension isn't necessary to answer the questions correctly), so you shouldn't either.\n\n3. Even in the Research summaries passages, the vast majority of questions will be found in the charts/graphs/tables/etc., so spend your time there. Only if you can't find it there (and sometimes you won't) should you look to the paragraphs.\n\n4. Watch out for the little things. This is the main trademark of high scorers in the Science: they are careful. Most questions people miss have to do with little things like negative signs (-100 is not less than -500, it's greater), not noticing differences in decimal places or scientific notation between different numbers, automatically assuming that the two things next to one another in a table are what you should be comparing, assuming that the table is in order of least to greatest or vice versa, and so on. Take the time to be careful.\n\n5. Take the time to memorize the simple graphs and what they mean about the data they're representing. These include positive slopes, negative slopes, flat lines, vertical lines, \"peaks\" (line goes up then down; these lines look like mountain peaks), \"valleys\" (line goes down then up; these lines look like valleys as well as the letter \"v\"), exponential-based curve (slope keeps increasing), and the limit curve (slope keeps decreasing, or trending toward a specific flat line). These kinds of graphs all tell you something about their data. Not only will you have to sometimes have to choose between several graphs, but it can also help you with random problems to quickly draw the data's overall trend.\n\nHere are my strategies for the last kind:\n\n1. The 2 or 3 passages will be the same except that they differ in opinion on 1 or 2 key issues. These 1 or 2 main points can almost always be found in the first sentence of the first paragraph and the last sentence of the last paragraph. This isn't an accident: it has to do with where the ACT makers believe the thesis and the conclusion, respectively, should be placed.\n\n2. Don't try to hurry and just underline these two sentences. Take the time to re-write in shorthand, in your own words, what each is saying. Not only does this provide an easy place to refer to for the numerous questions that refer to these main topics, but it also forces you to understand what it's saying and prevents you getting screwed later. Do this for the 2 points in passage 1, then the 2 points in passage 2, etc.\n\n3. There may not be a second main point, so don't spend a lot of time trying to find the hidden point in the last sentence if one isn't immediately apparent. A good way to tell if something is a main point or not is that a main point will show up in all of the passages (\"Tornadoes break windows because of X\" \"Tornadoes break windows because of Y\" etc.), due to the Science section's design.\n\n4. As for reading the passages in full, it's up to you. There will be some questions that ask about specific details in the body of the passage, but these can usually be located easily and are pretty obvious. If you're fine on time, I'd recommend reading them for peace of mind's sake, but I wouldn't worry if you're pressed on time and want to skip it.\n\n\n\nSo there you have it! Thanks for reading and I hope you gleaned a few tips. Do you have any suggestions for me?

So, if you're interested in getting an 800 and you'd like to see how I did it, read on! :D\n(All books/resources I used/recommend will be listed at the end.)\n\nI should tell you all that this was actually my second time taking this exam; my first time was in December, and I didn't do so well (750). Also, I've never had an official pre-calculus class, so I basically taught myself pre-calculus by preparing for this exam.\n\nBOOKS--\nOn CC, many will tell you that Barron's is the way to go in terms of SAT II Math 2 prep. There is no denying that Barron's is excellent. Its difficulty relative to the actual exam is what makes it such a good resource; however, the difficulty of Barron's is often over-exaggerated. There are claims that you can add ~100-150 points to your Barron's scores to get your projected score on the \"real thing.\" While this may prove accurate in some cases, those cases are most likely few and far between. My highest Barron's score was a 740; I got a 750 on the actual thing. The thing I found with Barron's is that Barron's will teach you the concepts if you're unfamiliar with them, but it will not help with speed. For that, you need Dr. Chung's.\n\nDr. Chung's SAT II Math Level 2 is absolutely amazing. I could probably go on for days about how much this book helped me. In this book, Dr. Chung presents \"57 perfect tips\" to help you ace the exam. These tips pretty much deal with many of the concepts presented in Barron's, but they show you how to apply the concepts to relatively tricky problems which I don't really think Barron's does. These tips can help you snag those few hard questions you may not get, and some of the shortcuts you'll learn as a result of applying these tips will save you a lot of time. Dr. Chung's is amazing at building speed and will help you solidify your SAT II problem solving skills. I HIGHLY recommend this book. I took two/three weeks to go through his 57 perfect tips and take practice exams. I analyzed the questions I missed, learned the mistakes I made, and tried my best to not repeat them. My scores in Chung were usually ~640ish. I got an 800 on the actual exam.\n\n\"Official\" materials-The CollegeBoard has a book of released exams that contains one official exam for each subject test. If you're planning to take multiple subject tests, you may as well get this book; if not, then I wouldn't waste my money. The CB exams are, from my experiences, easier than their \"real\" counterparts, and their primary function, in my opinion, is to serve as confidence boosters the night before the exam. I took the official math II practice exam the night before my first attempt; I made an 800 on it but, as I've mentioned above, only a 750 on the real thing.\n\nTIPS--\n1. START EARLY. Give yourself at least a month of prep time. If you're relatively good at math and you can dedicate 6-7 hours per week for an entire month going through your prep book, you're pretty much good to go. If you'd like to do both Barron's and Chung's (which is essentially what I did), I'd try to get at least two months of prep time.\n\n2. STRENGTHS/WEAKNESSES: If you are lacking in a certain mathematical area (I believe my friend @loltired didn't have a complete grasp of algebra II), your prep book (especially if you're using Barron's) should take care of that. If you use Chung's in conjunction with Barron's, Chung will show you how to apply the math you learn in Barron's to complex situations. Even if you think you're strong in a certain area, you should still skim through the relevant section in the book(s) to see if there's any additional material you may not know.\n\n3. SPEED. Speed is key on this exam. You have to work both quickly and accurately. In your practice sessions, give yourselves fifty minutes to finish the test instead of the full hour. If you do this for a few tests (4-6), you should build sufficient speed. For me, this wasn't necessary; just going through Chung's normally helped. For you, it may be different, so if you need to speed up, I suggest limiting your time for at least a few practice exams. If you're using both Barron's and Chung's, I'd suggest doing a few of the Barron's untimed so you can learn. Do all of the Chung except one timed; for half of the ones you do timed, cut your time to 50 minutes. For the other half, allow yourself the full hour. Do the 50 minute ones at first, and once you've built up enough speed, allow yourself one hour again.\n\n4. CALCULATOR. You are allowed a calculator that does NOT have to have its memory cleared. Use it wisely. If you don't think you'll remember formula x, save formula x in your calculator's memory. If you don't have time to memorize certain things, save them in the calculator. Just know that you should still be familiar with APPLYING the saved formulas so that you can still answer the questions on the actual exam.\n\nWHAT I DID--\nIn my initial attempt, I used Barron's for a month to prepare. I finished chapter one first jumped around the book to suit my strengths/weaknesses. For example, I decided to save coordinate geometry until the end because geometry isn't my strongest area of math. I finished up the concepts that were easier for me before tackling the harder ones. As a result, the final two weeks of prep were really intensive. In my practice exams, I scored 640-740 and ended up with a 750 on the actual. I didn't even fully learn probability, actually, due to a combination of laziness and lack of time.\n\nMy second attempt was preceded by preparing with Dr. Chung's. Armed with the knowledge I'd gained from Barron's, I went through Dr. Chung's \"57 perfect tips.\" This expanded what I'd learned from Barron's and taught me how to apply the knowledge to tricky problems. I took all the practice exams timed (I think I took maybe one untimed), and consistently scored in the 640s. I ended up with an 800 on the actual. I believe the combination of Barron's and Dr. Chung's is what helped me achieve my perfect score. I HIGHLY recommend, if you have the time and resources, that you get both books and set aside two months to prepare--one month for Barron's, and the second month for Chung. Funnily enough, I STILL didn't finish probability my second time around. (I really hate probability :P)\n\nRESOURCES--\n-Barron's SAT II Math Level 2 by Richard Ku: http://goo.gl/sxaj7O\n-Dr. Chung's SAT II Math Level 2 by Dr.John Chung: http://goo.gl/BHPCTu\nPrep books can be fairly expensive, so I suggest looking on half.ebay.com as well.

A character from F.Scott Fitzgerald's novel, Jay Gatsby's determination and persistence in going after his dreams, defying the beliefs of his elders and elite bodies, show how going against the common belief of authoritative figures can prove to advance oneself in the world.\nFor example, by not believing in his parents' way of life and being persistent on not becoming like them, Gatsby attains his opportunity to wealth. Gatsby comes from a poor family who are all farmers living in the Midwest. His parents do not see much opportunity in Gatsby's future when he was a child and expect him to become a farmer, but Gatsby believes he can strive to become very wealthy and be something more rewarding than a farmer. And so, by ignoring his parents' predictions and disbelief in Gatsby's dream, he runs away from home and one day, at sea during a storm, saves wealthy copper mogul, Dan Cody, from drowning. With the belief that Dan Cody could help him on his way to the top, Gatsby sails with him for some years and learns the mannerisms of the wealthy from Cody. Gatsby's rebellion of parents' ideals puts him on the path to becoming an immensely wealthy individual.\nAnother example of how is essential for one to question authority is when Nick Carraway comes to question Tom and Daisy Buchanan's lack of morals and ends up cutting ties with them. Tom and Daisy Buchanan are authoritative figures in that they possess an abundance of wealth. Nick, at first, is friendly and helpful towards them, yet as he witnesses their selfish acts against Gatsby, like framing him for a murder that Daisy had committed, he is disgusted by them and their wealth. By doing this, Nick probably saved himself from being used unfairly by them and taken advantage of. He also comes to the important realization that wealth can be detrimental to a person once they attain it. Therefore, Nick has saved himself and learned something by challenging the acts of high figures like Tom and Daisy.\nMany might believe that if Gatsby had listened to authority, he would've actually survived not been murdered by George Wilson at a very early age in the novel. But if Gatsby had done this, he never could've inspired Nick Carrawat to be hopeful and always dream of more than what others limit you to. Gatsby, by being who he was, was the only person Nick could respect and had been the reason for Nick remaining hope in humanity.\nAll in all, Gatsby and Nick's questioning and defiance of authority had led to each other's benefit and advancement in thought throughout the novel.\n\nEssay 2:\n\nPrompt:  Do people need to spend less time with others in order to appreciate them?\n\nResponse: The more time one spends apart from another, the more he or she longs to be with the other. I concur with the belief that people need to spend less time with others in order to appreciate them, The relationships portrayed by F. Scott Fitzgerald in the The Great Gatsby prove this statement to be prevalent among many.\nFor example, the increase in Gatsby's fascination and love for Daisy Buchanan, his love interest, after being away from her for more than two years, shows how distance can deepen one's appreciation for another. Twenty-five year old Jay Gatsby falls in love with Daisy at first sight but their relationship is put to an end when Gatsby is forced to move across the country to fight in war for three years. During the gap, Daisy had married Tom Buchanan, so one would perceive that Gatsby probably would have moved on from Daisy, but Gatsby's adoration of Daisy grows even more and as result, attains a plethora of wealth just to win her back when he reunites with her. During the time that Gatsby is away from Daisy, he only has the idea of her in his head and he had made that idea into something much more beautiful and endearing than is Daisy's actual character. If Gatsby had spent more time with Daisy, he would've realized her greed and selfish nature, therefore reducing his adulation of her. Thus Gatsby's separation from Daisy had resulted in his further adoration of her.\nAnother character whose love of an other character deepened with distance is Nick Carraway. As Nick Carraway had gotten to know Gatsby, he grew more fond of his imagination and ability to believe in himself. Once Gatsby had died, Nick seemed to have gained a deep respect for Gatsby and his ideals.  He even states, \"Only one man was an exempt from my disgust, Gatsby...\" If Gatsby was to survive and Nick had the chance to get to know Gatsby better, he would've gotten more involved in Gatsby's illegal bootlegging business since Gatsby was bound to eventually be arrested for that and Nick's last idea of Gatsby would've been that of shame. Carraway's inevitable separation from Gatsby had served to let him find comfort in the thought of Gatsby and leads to Nick's respect for him.\nOverall, both Gatsby and Carraway, as their thoughts had focused on the person they had been away from, formed an ideal and image of perfection of that individual because they hadn't the knowledge their true characters without their company in person.\n\nPlease reply with possible corrections I could make to improve my essay and tips!\n\n\n\n\n\n"}, {"date": "2015-09-09T10:02:47+00:00", "url": "http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/act-preparation/1809458-grade-my-essay-new-act-style-i-made-up-my-own-prompt.html", "messages": "\n                    Hi!\nWell, as there are very few practice prompts out there for the new ACT essay, I decided to edit an old one to a more modern style. Here is the prompt (with three perspectives) and my try. It would help me so much if you could grade it, or provide any tips!\n\n\n\n\nHere is the prompt:\n\nAt some high schools, teachers have considered allowing each student to choose the books he or she will read for English class rather than requiring all students in class to read the same books. Some teachers support such a policy because they think students will greatly improve their reading skills if they read books they find interesting. Other teachers do not support such a policy because they think that students will learn more by participating in class discussion with others who have read the same books. In your opinion, should each individual student be allowed to choose the books he or she reads for English class?\nIn your essay, take a position on this question, using the Perspectives given below.\n\nPerspective 1: Picking your own books will motivate you to actually read it. Therefore, you will understand the content much more deeply.\n\nPerspective 2: A class discussion is the most valuable for a student's understanding of a book. Many students don't know how to analyze a book fully on their own; together they can.\n\nPerspective 3: By choosing a book him- or herself, a student will get to know his reading preferences. This is essential for later reading.\n\n\n\n\nHere is my try (I wrote in in the 40-minute time limit, so it's certainly not flawless. Any tips would help a lot!!).\n\n\n\n\nNowadays, many English teachers find it worth examining whether they should let their students free to choose the books they read, or not.\nAlthough requiring students to read the same books might not be the most motivating option, it will ultimately generate a deeper understanding of literature through class discussions.\n\nIt is certainly true that you learn more from reading a book you like than from a novel you are forced to read. This is in agreement with Perspective 1. However, the freedom to choose any book they like will ultimately not benefit students' literary understanding. To demonstrate this, several school libraries in The Netherlands counted how many books, written by the 'Big Three writers', were borrowed during a school year. It turned out that at school where students were free to choose their books, much fewer 'Big Three novels'--which are considered very hard and time-consuming to read--were lent out. This shows that students prefer easier books over challenging ones, when they are given freedom of choice. In the end, this will result in only a superficial knowledge of literature.\n\nAnother often-heard point is that pupils still have to discover their reading preferences. Perspective 3 also takes this point of view. Although this might sometimes be the case, it is more often true that students do know their preferences. This can have devastating effects on one's education. For instance, Lucy, a girl in my class, was a huge fan of fantasy novels. She would did every single English assignment on Harry Potter, The Hobbit or Avatar, to name a few. As a result, my teacher was flabbergasted when he evaluated her high school literary journey. Because Lucy had only traveled to fictitious places and times, she was unable to tell him anything whatsoever about F. Scott Fitzgerald. My teacher then realized that his book policy did not work.\n\nIt was no coincidence that this teacher then introduces the obligatory-book-rule. This means that every student reads the same book, and learns from it through a class discussion. As Perspective 2 states, this results in a much deeper understanding of a book. Thirty kids simply know more than one. The result is a process of synergy, where every student contributes to the discussion of the book. He might give a different point of view, or focus on a small but important detail few had noticed.\nThe shortcoming of this system is that some students will not read anything that differs from 'their' genre, some might say. However, a teacher can diminish this effect by letting the students vote. Consequently, they will not feel forced to read a dull novel. Rather, it would look like they still made their own choice.\n\nTaking all this into consideration, I can say it is best to give the teacher the choice. Then the 'Big Three' books in The Netherlands will probably fly off the shelves.\n\n__________________________\n\nFeel free to give any feedback, I would really appreciate it!\n"}, {"date": "2014-10-18T03:15:45+00:00", "url": "http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/college-essays/1696716-guide-to-crafting-differentiated-powerful-essays-part-2-making-your-essay-the-1-in-1000.html", "messages": "\n                    This is the good stuff. What if I can guarantee you that your essay can be the 1 in 1000, regardless of what experiences you have had in your life?\n\n\u201cWhat?!?!?! Even me? But my life has been so boring, I haven\u2019t faced crazy adversity or won any national awards?\u201d\nGuess what? I don\u2019t care. You can still be the 1 in 1000. Here\u2019s how\u2026\n\nAsk smart questions about your topic, and use those smart questions to come up with 5-6 critical elements to your essay. While those 5-6 critical elements may be unoriginal in isolation, you create a unique essay by threading those elements together in a thoughtful way.\n\nEven if you\u2019re competing with the most original, unique stories from your competitors, most won\u2019t go to the deep and thoughtful level of your essay. And guess what? If I\u2019m in admissions, I ask myself \u201chow will student XYZ enrich and add to the experience of our student body if we accept this person?\n\nThat\u2019s far more valuable than a \u201cunique\u201d essay topic. The only thing a truly unique topic has as a competitive advantage over you is that the unique 1 in 1000 experience has a tendency to more naturally answer those questions. But anyone can answer those questions. Anyone can do it. Most don\u2019t because they\u2019re ignorant or lazy.This is how ANYONE can be the 1 in 1000.\n\nLet\u2019s say you want to write on the most boring topic ever\u2026a travel story.\n\nPRIMARY TOPIC\n\nSo yah, hundreds of people write on that every year. No, it might even be less because it\u2019s such a boring topic that people actively try and avoid it. Now\u2026let\u2019s morph it.\n1)\tWas this a vacation with parents, a vacation with friends, a missionary trip, etc.?\n2)\tWhy did you go? Was it on your own will?\n3)\tWhat did you learn from the trip? How did you grow?\n4)\tHow does the trip reflect your personality? How does it exemplify the type of energy/vibe you\u2019re going to radiate at my college if I accept you?\n\nI mean\u2026better. You naturally would touch on some of these topics, but keeping those topics in mind and explicitly (or implicitly) expressing them on the essay does give you some depth. Now, let\u2019s overlay the primary topic with a secondary topic.\n\nSECONDARY TOPIC\n\nAlright, let\u2019s make this an even more boring scenario. You went with your family.\n1)\tWhat\u2019s your most interesting relationship between your family? Annoying sister? Cool dad? Weird step-mom?\n2)\tWhich relationship was progressed the most in the trip and why /// what relationship was not progressed despite your desire to progress it?\n3)\tDid a relationship change because you wanted it to change, or was there an unexpected change.\n4)\tWas there a unique dynamic to your relationship that was exemplified during this trip?\n\nTERTIARY TOPIC\n\nAlright, let\u2019s make this the most boring scenario. You didn't even go anywhere cool.\n1)\tWhat did you emotionally experience from being on this vacation? How does that contrast?\n2)\tWas this trip even meaningful? Was it your first time doing something or going somewhere? Or have you gone there before?\n\nOkay\u2026so putting it all together. Here\u2019s a 1 in 1000 essay. This mirrors an actual essay that was highly, highly successful in admissions results from a few years ago (by this site\u2019s standards).\n\nYou go on regular fishing trips with your family. It\u2019s a ritual, a habit, something reliable and predictable. Nothing special happens every time, but the experience of going on these trips is special because you can get away from this distracted world of smartphones and Snapchat to just\u2026bond with your dad (Include 2 examples). Even though you don\u2019t have the money to travel internationally, the most valuable experiences you have are ones when you can get closer with the people you care about. You\u2019re a firm believer in having a foundation. These boring times build a foundation that allows you to hold steady in the most crazy times (give an example). It\u2019s going to be weird leaving behind these fishing trips when you go to college, but at the same time, you have 4 dedicated years of being around your peers to build these relationships every day. To build new, boring, and memorable habits. The best experiences of them all.\n\nNow\u2026literally, that was the most unoriginal life experience. And seriously, if you complain about not having regular fishing trips you go on with your family, you\u2019re completely missing the point and I give up on you hahaha.\n\nNote, I said 1 in 1000 because over the course of an admissions officer\u2019s career, there will be essays that contain similar elements to this one. However, \n\nCheck my post history for part 1. I will keep blogging throughout this year\u2019s admissions cycle.\n\nI cannot guarantee you anything, but I can give you your best chance.\n\nP.S. I\u2019m available to help anyone with one essay via PM as well, as long as you send it to me 1 week before the deadline as I am busy with my job during most days.\n"}, {"date": "2015-09-27T01:18:06+00:00", "url": "http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/sat-act-tests-test-preparation/1814220-please-grade-my-essay.html", "messages": "\n                    This prompt is from test #1 in the blue book. Any errors that appear here are actual errors from my essay. I appreciate all advice and criticism that I receive. I do have a question though - how accurate do my facts and evidence have to be? You'll see why I asked when you read the essay haha. Anyways, I did fill up the entirety of the two pages.\n\nPrompt: Is it important to question the ideas and decisions of people in positions of authority?\n\nIt is absolutely important to question the ideas and decisions of people in positions of authority to expose and criticize their methods of governance. Several examples from history, literature, and current world events all demonstrate that questioning authority is crucial to enlighten the population of its leaders.\n\nSubstantiated by the age of the Enlightenment in Europe, questioning people in authority exposes the faults of their governance. John Locke noticed early on how corrupt European politics, from the English monarch to the Spanish throne, had become. In his treatises released to the public, he questioned the validity of absolute monarchs and criticized their methods of ruling the population. After Locke had exposed the flaws of European royal governments, many other philosophers became \"enlightened\" and dispersed word of this high level corruption. One great result of Locke's bravery was the English Bill of Rights, which limited the monarch's power and awarded people rights. Therefore, questioning authority is necessary to allow people to become aware of pitfalls in their government.\n\nIn the novel 1984, questioning authority is seen as a necessary ingredient to expose the government's corrupt tactics. The main character, Winston, is an employee of the government and learned of the extreme corruption that existed while on the job. He soon sought collaboration from his inner circle of friends to help support his mission. Soon enough, many people in his area soon understood what their government was doing - consolidating power - and attempted to put an end to it. Without Winston's questioning his leaders in positions of authority, the population would've remained unaware of the politics that greatly affected their lives.\n\nSupported by the exposure of the corrupt Saudi Arabian government, questioning authority has the power to use criticism against the government to change horrible realities. Abdul was a young man who lived in Saudi Arabia and learned of the horrific cases of brutality that his government was involved in. Set out to ameliorate his society, Abdul began collaborating with civil rights leaders from all over the world and released data that exposed the inhumane sexism and barbarism that was practised in Saudi Arabia. Although Abdul was met with vicious punishments, his bravery resulted in women receiving the permission to drive and a change in Saudi Arabia's legislature that lowered the rate of capital punishment. Thus, to improve the conditions of society, it is necessary to question people in positions of authority and expose their faults.\n\nAs corroborated by the Enlightenment, the novel 1984, and Abdul's case in Saudi Arabia, it is, indeed, important to question people in power. Without it, society remains the same and rulers are free to do as they please.

I want to make this thread as a way to share a different perspective on the Macaulay program than a prospective student might get from the typical advertising from the college and offer to answer any questions you might have. When I applied to Macaulay, it was tied with Cornell for my top school. Since I only got a transfer offer from Cornell, I decided to go to Macaulay and try to make the best of it and see how I liked it. My experience in the first semester was so terrible that I'm now resolved to transfer at the end of this year. In this thread I'll describe both my worst and best experiences with Macaulay. For me the sum of these experiences ended up negative. Others may have a different weighting which would lead them to a different decision. The important thing is that you have as much ACCURATE information as possible. Don't be like me and decide after going to a few nice recruitment events.\n\nPros: I'll start with the good just to give the few decent things there were the recognition they deserve. These are the factors which made this decision really difficult.\n\n-Good Macaulay staff and professors. With one or two exceptions, most of the people who directly work for Macaulay are very nice, interesting, and helpful. The two professors I've had for the NYC seminar courses were both really experienced in their fields and shared a lot with us. My arts professor went above and beyond the budget he got from Macaulay by raising funds and getting free tickets from friends in the arts community. We got to see a lot of stuff as a result and he even offered to pay for taxis home from late night events for people who felt unsafe.\n\n-Great optional events. If you do go, always check Macaulay Mondays/NOW. There are a bunch of interesting events they host. I went to 2 dinners with a fairly prominent businessman and policy analyst to discuss interesting current events topics. At Baruch I got to see former secretary general of the UN Kofi Annan speak. As part of a club at Baruch I got to attend a breakfast discussion at the UN with US ambassador to the UN Betty King along with a room full of business, diplomatic, and policy elites.\n\n-Culture and Opportunities in the City. I'll express my frustrations with the city later, but the payoff to putting up with that frustration is access to a world of amazing things to do and see. Just keep in mind that as a full time student you will rarely have the time or energy to see even a fraction of it all.\n\n\n\nCons:\n\nNot really free. Ignore all the nice advertising about not having to pay anything or leaving debt free. First off, keep in mind that CUNY tuition is already really cheap, so if you compare it to almost any other scholarship a person smart enough to get into Macaulay might get, it is a pretty meager amount. Second, unless you already live in NYC or go to Hunter, cost of living in NYC is huge. When we did the calculations for our estimated cost of going to Macaulay, we found that it would actually be a bit more expensive than just going to a SUNY like Binghamton or Geneseo. It's even worse if you are struggling to pay for college. One of my friends in the program told me that Macaulay actually used the Federal grants he got to pay tuition rather than paying the full amount from the scholarship. This means that he had less for other expenses like food and housing, and as a result he moved to an apartment that is an hour and a half away from the school because of costs.\n\nThey lied to us about the laptops. We were advertised Macbook Pros. Starting our year they switched to the cheaper, less powerful Air, which isn't suitable for a lot of functions you might need out of a computer such as photo/video editing and gaming. When someone from the FB group emailed the tech guy to ask about the change, he gave a BS answer about the Air being better than the Pro which was simply false. Before the argument that it is free: 1. If I went to a SUNY with the money I saved I could have bought a better laptop. 2. Because of their decision, I had to lug my desktop into the city just to be able to use the aforementioned functions. It takes up a lot of space in my tiny room.\nAlso, we are supposed to have \"Information Technology Fellows (ITFs)\" to help out with tech issues. It turns out that these ITFs are actually just grad students who aren't even majoring in or experts in technology. They've only shown up a few times, and it was always to do something pointless like \"teach\" us how to use Wordpress or Prezi.\n\nBad advisor/bureaucracy. They advertise the advising as something fairly individualized and helpful. The reality is that you share an advisor with what I estimate to be around 160 students. None of the interactions I've had with my advisor have been helpful in any way. She offers very little actual information or advice. For a very simple question, she sent me on a bureaucratic scavenger hunt to find the answer. One of the departments she sent me to even implied that it was her job to know the answer! Whenever I've wanted to do something, she either didn't help or even impeded my ability to do what I needed. For registration we had to run our schedules by her. Before I thought this was supposed to be so she could give us advice, but it was actually just her checking to see that our times worked out. She did nothing unless she was stopping me from doing something.\n\nI've had to deal with multiple problems registering for courses and figuring out my major because of stupid restrictions Baruch imposed that I incorrectly thought Macaulay would override. We are supposed to get priority registration, however your schedule can still get messed up in a few ways due to either Baruch or Macaulay: You can't take courses after 5pm, so for some classes that have a very limited number of sections offered, you lose a lot of flexibility. You have to take the seminar courses which you have to compete for with all the other Macaulay students with priority registration, so you can get a bad schedule as a result. I logged on to register the minute I was able to and I still didn't get my first choice, and as a result I have to wake up really early 2/4 days of the week. Baruch has a policy that gives priority to Zicklin students for 3000+ level economics classes even though there is a BA Econ major in Weissman. Because of this, if I wanted to take the next level of econ, I would have had to wait until way after everyone else registered just to find out if my schedule works. The only other option I had was to declare for economics now, and even then I still would have had to go through an approval process just to get the class. My advisor also gave me a hard time when I wanted to take winter classes. Another problem I've had is that Baruch doesn't allow double majors between the 3 schools. When I asked why, I was given the dumbest answer ever: \"They are 2 different degrees.\" As if it was incomprehensible to them that they could print a second piece of paper or print some extra words on the first piece of paper.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}, {"date": "2013-11-22T19:54:30+00:00", "url": "http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/carnegie-mellon-university/1581081-before-you-post-cmu-faq.html", "messages": "\n                    Hello prospective students, parents and alumni.\nI am currently an undergraduate student at CMU and from the past few years on the Carnegie Mellon forum I've noticed that a lot of threads and posts get repetitive, so I decided to compile a list of the most common questions (and basic answers) that are asked around here.\nI divided the posts into parts, so feel free to ctrl + F (cmd + F) what you're looking for.\nIn addition, this is something that came off the top of my head, so I will keep updating it as I get new/more information. By all means please feel free to suggest any additions or corrections.\nHope this helps and best of luck!\n\n*** General CMU Information ***\n*** Academics ***\n*** Financial Aid ***\n*** Admission Process ***\n*** Chance me ***\n*** Additional Resources ***\n\n[size=+1] General CMU Information [/size]\n\nAlthough CMU is known for its technical programs, the fine arts, business, and architecture programs have a lot to offer. There are a bunch of schools that compare to these programs, but Computer Science related majors are more widely known amongst industry. In fact, many CMU graduates occupy Silicon Valley and are part of top engineering and technology companies around the globe. We have famous artists and successful businessmen come out representing the school. Basically, Carnegie Mellon name is as well known as Ivys, Stanford, Caltech, MIT in the career world. (So just because your high school friends never heard of it, does not mean your dream employers wouldn't.)\n\nYes.\nYes, there are plenty of opportunities to meet and interact with girls, on a daily basis, regardless of your major.\nNo, they are not socially awkward.\nYes, they are ALL smart.\nIf you're looking to be surrounded by gorgeous models, you're looking in the wrong school. But if you want to be shallow about it, there are plenty of pretty girls/attractive guys around, you just have to look/try.\n\n1. Dating: Yes, people, including those of different sexual orientations, date. Do you have time for a relationship? Depends on where your priorities are and how good you are at managing your time. It is in no way looked down upon and always worth it. Unlike what some may think, CS and engineering majors do date, be it within the major or outside, either one is likely.\n2. Partying: There are parties every weekend if you know where to look. The parties themselves aren't \"state college\" crazy and some are even labeled as dancing parties, or sit down social parties. Possibly, people hook up. If you would like to get wasted you can probably find a way, and most likely you won't be alone. However, that does NOT make the campus community dangerous in any way and there is no peer pressure whatsoever to participate in various illegal activities. (<- what I love/respect the CMU community for the most)\n3. Other: If you're not into that, there are a TON of options such as hanging around with friends, going to CMU sponsored events (concerts, shows, $1 movie nights, outdoor activities, etc)\n\nContrary to popular belief, there is no single cafeteria/dining hall with buffet style eating.\nThe campus food is not gourmet but for the most part, it's satisfying. A meal plan is mandatory for freshman year and the suggested one usually has enough, if not more than needed. If you are tired of campus food, you have an option to get off the meal plan starting sophomore year, as do a lot of students who end up eating off campus or making their own food.\nThe campus food has plenty of cuisines and there are healthy/vegetarian/gluten free/etc options as well. If you're wondering what meal plan to choose as a freshman look here and here.\n\nFun. Being a residential assistant (RA) is a competitive job and only the most amazing kids get them. As a result, your RAs are really helpful, entertaining and caring.\nCMU offers co-ed (from by floor to mixed floor, not by room unless you're an upperclassman), all-girls and all-guys dorming, in addition to Greek housing. There are dorms that have standard rooms and suite rooms, and apartments for upperclassmen.\n Which one do I choose?   This link  talks about the pros and cons of most on campus housing.\nCan I get a single? it is VERY rare to get single rooms and those are only given to special circumstances that usually involve serious medical/health issues. A note from parents doesn't cut it: there is a process you have to go through with a bunch of doctor documentations. Besides, CMU does its best to pair you up with students who are of similar life styles as you, thus it is pretty uncommon to see crazy roommate drama.\n What if I get a terrible roommate/floormates and I can't concentrate on my work?  Honestly, people almost always work on campus libraries or buildings. With that being said, if you're still able to focus on work in your own room, all dorms have quiet hours and in general, if you ask your neighbors nicely, they will respect your study hours. Worst possible case scenario (pretty much never happens) you can ask to move out during the academic year.\n\nPlease understand that CMU is not a state school that has nearly 80k fans show up to football or basketball games. However, it still has competitive options and our varsity teams compete in division III. Our men's and women's soccer teams are really good and thus admission is probably very competitive.  How competitive / time consuming?  I bet there are representatives from all CMU schools and nearly all majors in varsity teams, so it is very doable but puts stress on your schedule.  Here  is a more detailed discussion about various CMU athletics.\n If I don't want varsity, what can I do?  The university offers club sports which are less competitive but still have frequent practices (about 2-3 times a week, depending on the sport)  and compete with neighboring universities. Finally there is Intramural sports which is just friends or organizations making teams and playing within the school for fun. It is pretty unofficial and games are usually about once a week.\n Extra stuff  There are 100s of clubs and organizations that anyone can join. For an accurate list in detail, check  this out . Also, there's the school traditional  Buggy Racing  and  Kiltie Band .\n\n[size=+1] Academics [/size]\n\nNo. We have something called units, which correspond to the average number of hours a student might spend on the course per week. That includes lectures, recitations, labs and (approximate) homework. So usually a course is 10 or 12 units. An average student takes about 48-52 units a semester = about 4-5 courses.\n\nThere is still a letter based system but there are no +/-'s. Starting freshman fall semester, you will receive letter grades (unlike some colleges that do pass/fail initially) and a corresponding GPA, which is a weighted average based on the number of units a course was. So if you have an A in a 8-unit course and a C in a 12-unit course, your GPA will not be a perfect average of 4.0 and 2.0, it will be weighted more towards the 12-unit course grade.\nMost professors calculate and release mid-semester grades which DO contain +/- next to the letter grade, but these grades do not count towards your final grade. They are just there to tell you where you are approximately in the course.\n\n\"My heart is in the work\" -Andrew Carnegie.\nOur motto.\nSo yes there is a lot of work. Nevertheless, it is not so unbearable that (god forbid) students commit suicide or something. If you feel like you're too pressured in your major, there are SO many ways to work around it: asking professors/coaches/instructors for extra time, extra help; dropping classes without consequences at any point in time during the semester; seeking CMU's professional counseling. Plus, it is *completely* acceptable to switch majors, schools, or even take gap years. People switch majors or drop out of their majors often and with great ease, because no GPA, no penny is worth the demolition of your health. Here's the breakdown by school/major:\n School of Computer Science : The difficulty of classes is immense, and most CS classes average out to about 15 hours a week of work. You would usually take about 2-3 CS courses each semester with some general education classes. It is doable and there is a ton of help offered from the best faculty and the brightest kids.\nCS majors still participate in extra-curricular activities, hang out with friends and TA (teaching assistant) classes. However, the amount of free time you have in the end and what you spend it on is entirely up to you. People say they're always working, yet they still spend time with their friends, most of whom are probably working on the same thing. A sample course requirement list. \n Carnegie Institute of Technology: Engineering is a tough field and it requires a certain type of thinking. Depending on the engineering major you will have more or less work. From what I hear and personal experiences, ECE is the most difficult (and selective) engineering major, followed by ChemE/MatSci, MechE and CivE.  The links are to sample schedules/curriculum of each major.\n Mellon College of Science: Here is where I hear different stories based on majors. If it had to be rated, Math and Physics would have the highest workload, followed closely by Chemistry and then Biology\n\n Tepper School of Business: Comparing the workload of Tepper and the previously mentioned schools is like comparing oranges to apples. Tepper has a very unique curriculum and classes which have their own set of goals and requirements. Generally, the attitude towards the work is more relaxed with business majors, yet there are some who aim very high and are always busy either working on double majors, minors or actively looking for internships/jobs. The only business major friends I have are in fraternities, so they have time to be deeply involved in the frat and still do well in school. Here is an interesting thread for some basic Tepper Q/A.\n College of Fine Arts (excluding Architecture):  Similar to Tepper, it's hard to compare the workloads to other schools. However, the required classes don't take a lot of your time at all, so it's totally up to the students to decide whether they spend hours upon hours practicing (if music) or working on personal projects (if art). It's very open for one to try out a bunch of stuff (courses at other schools, study abroad, greek life/organizations). My music major friend was able to switch into SCS in his sophomore year with all the music requirements already completed. So yes, it is relatively more relaxed.\n Architecture: on the other hand, is much more time consuming and semester schedules are not very flexible. Students receive a booklet in freshman year that pretty much plans out their schedules for the next 5 years (in case you weren't aware, architecture program is a 5 year program). In terms of arch-related work, you hear students always mention the all-nighters that they pulled and how people just live in the studio. However, that does not accurately reflect the whole population. I know archies who don't goof around and just focus on the work, manage their time and have frequent free evenings/weekends. But be prepared to work a lot.\n Dietrich College (H&SS): Probably the least demanding school judging by the required coursework. However, students usually still take the full ~50 units by filling their schedules with various electives from CMU's schools and maybe courses of double majors or minors. This is a nice post that goes into more detail about H&SS life.\n\nNo. It is recommended but it's not required. I'd say about 30% of kids in each graduating class come to the school without prior knowledge of programming. (By the way, programming =/= website design, so saying that you made some basic websites is not saying that you know programming). And those who have programmed before probably struggle as much as those who haven't, because the CS courses here are based on a completely different mindset from what you might have had before. Still, if you're deciding whether you should or shouldn't learn some language before applying and you have the time, the answer is you should.\n\nYes.\nIs it really doable? Yes.\nReally? Yes.\nNobody at CMU will ever say no to you if you want to reach higher. Your advisors might warn you against some things because of the increase in workload, but they will never stop you. So any combination of majors and minors that CMU offers is available for you. However, some departments have restrictions on double majors and minors (aka some don't offer them , GPA restrictions, unit restrictions) so you have to consult the actual department for specifics.\nI'll be honest though: be careful about what responsibilities you put on yourself. If your dream job is in software engineering but you also love biology, taking just certain courses in software engineering as a biology major (or vise versa) might suffice rather than double majoring in CS + biology and taking a whole bunch of other unnecessary courses. In addition, some majors will have pretty much no overlap (overlap: a course that fulfills a requirement in both tracks, aka killing two birds with one stone) in courses and it will require you to either come in with a bunch of AP/college credit, overload (overload: taking more units/courses than maximum suggested by your primary department, usually >54) every semester, and/or spend extra money on summer semesters.\nIf you're worried about not getting a job in the industry because you don't have 3 majors and 5 minors, you're wrong. A lot of companies don't care what your diploma says and they care about what you actually know (crazy, isn't it?). So if you're a bio major who's applying for a programming job, you are more likely to get the job if you put on your resume all the programming courses you've taken/projects you might have done and answer technical questions correctly, rather than have a double major standing and not know what you're doing during the interviews.\nFor your convenience, I also included the double major requirements for each department:\n SCS: CS, HCI, Robotics\n CIT: I'm not a 100% sure on this, but I believe you can only double major within CIT, and for minors there are certain ones that are offered for non-engineering students. Refer to this description. So engineering cannot be declared as a secondary major if your primary major is not in CIT. If you want to double major in engineering and something else, engineering must be your primary department. (I will double check on this)\n MCS: Chemistry, Math, Physics, Biology\n Tepper:  Business Administration,  Economics, Computational Finance is not offered as a double major and is a very competitive program on its own.\n CFA: Architecture is not offered as a double major but is offered as a  minor. (Besides, double majoring in architecture\u0085who would do that to themselves?) I don't think Art has a double major program but it also has a  minor.,  Music, Design is a competitive program so a  minor is pretty much like a double major because it's a selective admission.\nH&SS There are a lot of majors to be offered and majority offer  double majors but you have to contact departments themselves. I just know that Information Systems is not offered as neither double major nor a minor.\n\nCMU does not have courses over winter break, but it has 2 summer sessions. Be aware that summer courses aren't cheap and I don't think it's as popular to take summer classes here as in other schools. I believe tuition is $300/unit (so if you take a regular core curriculum course, which is usually 12 units, you pay nearly 4 grand. That's not including cost of living and food). That's why I'm saying be very careful about how you plan out your double majors, minors and courseworks: summer classes might not always be the best option to catch up.\n\nYes. It's always up to you. The reason I'm able to answer questions about other schools so in depth is that my friend group of nearly 12 kids pretty much has no two people with the same major. The best way to meet people outside your major are in your dorm (my friend group was my dorm room floor), general education classes (electives), organizations, sports and clubs. There's actually a lot of interactions between schools and quite a lot of students tend to have two friend groups: friends outside their schools to hang out with and friends within their majors to do homework with.\n\nIt depends on the school but it's usually doable. For instance, nobody will stop you from switching but if you don't meet the new school's requirements, it gets very hard to impossible to transfer in.\nThe hardest one is probably SCS because it's the most popular and kids usually say \"well I'm gonna go to CMU for H&SS because it's really easy to get into and then when I'm here I'll switch into SCS.\" Well, the requirements for transferring include taking 2 years of CS major courses (which are still extremely difficult) while still in your primary major, getting pretty much As in all of them, AND getting special permission from the department head. So usually students just decide to stick with their primary major and apply to CS double major or just minor.\nAnother program that is very competitive is ECE. Because there is already a high demand for the major within CIT, coming in from another school is a bit harder than applying from within. Usually, the required Introduction to ECE course \"weeds out\" a good number of people (approximately 250 people enroll in the course each semester in their freshman years, and each ECE class is ~150. So 500-150 = :) )\nInformation System has pretty strict requirements for transferring as it is not offered as a secondary major or a minor. Even though it's part of the Deitrich College, it's a very competitive program that encompasses business, design and CS together.\nDesign is also very competitive and popular major. Transfer applications are taken very seriously and about 10-15 kids get accepted as transfers every year. Even the courses that they offer require special application (I heard students camped outside the office the night before to hand in their applications because it was first come first serve basis)\nFinally, Computational Finance is by far the hardest program to get into once you're here. They accept only 3-4 people each year, and legitimately you probably have to have a 4.0 when you apply.\n\nOther that those listed above, transferring process might include talking to a bunch of counselors and department heads, and then you're pretty much in.\nHow common is transferring? Very. Nobody is holding you in shackles so whatever you're comfortable with or interested in, it's up to you. CMU is very lenient and accepting of that kind of stuff. If you wrote a passionate essay about your love for CS and how you want to do it for the rest of your life, and once you're here you decide you despise it, nobody is going to call you up and reproach you for wanting to transfer out.\n\n[size=+1] Financial Aid [/size]\n\nHeh. This year's estimate was ~63,500. If you don't include thousands of dollars CMU estimates on books and supplies, it's about 59,500. After freshman year you can also cut off about 5k off the estimate for rooming and meal plan if you plan on living off campus and ditching the meal plan. Still, keep in mind that this is a private and a prestigious university, so don't expect tuition to be $15k.\n\nUnfortunately no. Unlike other schools who get a lot of funding, CMU cannot afford to offer financial aid to international students. The US government doesn't offer its aid to international students either. The foreign students whom I talked to said that their families can either afford the full cost or they are on some prestigious scholarships that were offered by their countries. So if you want to come to CMU, start looking for scholarships right away.\n\nYou can. CMU is an amazing school in every aspect\u0085except its aid. You are either one of the students who gets nearly a full ride or you don't get much; there isn't really a common ground.\n\nGrants: CMU has an undergraduate grant that is need-based. Once you and your parents fill out your Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) CMU does its best to meet your Estimated Family Contribution (EFC). IMPORTANT: Financial Aid is a first-come-first-serve basis. ED students get pretty much 100% of their aid met, so from then it's a race to whoever hands in their deposit/Fin Aid application the fastest for RD students. I.e. I was torn between CMU (RD) and another university, so I handed in my deposit in late April, and now my family has to pay twice our EFC.\nAside from university grant, you might be eligible to apply for federal grants, but usually those require you to be in serious financial need and they top at around $5.5k.\nScholarships:: Unfortunately, CMU does not offer URM, sports, robotics, business, math, etc. scholarships. The only merit based one available through the university is the Carnegie Scholarship, which is ONLY offered to incoming freshmen. Trust me, I've learned that the hard way. Basically, you don't explicitly apply to it when you apply to the school so you are automatically considered for it if you submit your FAFSA. It's given out to students who have excelled academically in high school and who can't get a lot of need-based aid. No you can't promise them to get a 4.0 in your freshman semesters, join 20 clubs and become the president of your class if they promise to consider you for the scholarship after you came to CMU. Either you get it when you apply or you never do.\n\nLoans: are offered to students at any point in time during the school year through the university but they are usually there to help kids who are in need of quick money for personal expenses/emergency situations. I.e. you need to buy a $150 textbook for a class but do not have the money, you may borrow from the university.\n\nYour financial package is not final. In other words, it will most likely change on a yearly basis. You must re-apply for the aid every year and depending on the new FAFSA information your package will be adjusted.\n\n\nLet me put it this way: CMU is an amazing school, great community, wonderful staff, plentiful of opportunities and if finances are the only things that are stopping you, you must realize the following:\n1. Private colleges are expensive no matter where you go. The only private colleges that offer great aid are those who are funded very well, i.e. Ivys, MIT, Caltech, Stanford, so on. But they are also harder to get into. CMU's name is still up there, as mentioned in the \"How prestigious is CMU\" question earlier.\n2. Looking at CMU's extremely high after college employment rate and the starting salaries of some majors, taking out loans to invest in your education will really pay off in the end. It's also a bit of a gamble: do not rely purely on the prestige of the school's name to get a job. As in, don't expect to be a lazy student and hope that putting \"Carnegie Mellon graduate\" on your resume will automatically get you a $80k job. This can still happen to you no matter where you go.\nI chose this school over the Cooper Union in NYC (which used to be free tuition when I applied) and I have never regretted my decision.\n\n[size=+1] Admissions process [/size]\n\nNo. You may send in ACT with Writing instead.\n\n Look here for per school subject tests requirements. And yes, you really really need them if they are listed on the required page. I'm not an admission officer however, so if you have some very special circumstances as to why you are not able to submit an SAT II score, contact the admission office at 412-268-2082, do NOT risk not submitting it and/or waiting until last minute to find out.\n\nAlways go for Math II. Which one should you submit is a different story. I'd say that if you're applying to CS or CIT and your Math II score is below 780 for the former, and below 720 for the latter, either re-take it if you have the time, or submit Math I. (and hope that your Math I is 790-800).\n\nIn the last section of this post, I included admission statistics by school. If you want to know whether you need to submit your score or not, just go to the school you're applying to, and see whether your score falls within the range. If it doesn't, do NOT submit it, and look for better options (i.e. SAT is terrible, but ACT is good=>submit ACT; retake the test). If you have no better options, it's really a gamble to apply. If you're very set on applying either way, a warning: CMU puts a LOT of stress on standardized tests scores and grades, so you should really polish the rest of your application, have very impressive extra curriculars and honors, and have a moving/convincing essay.\n\nNo, you should be fine as long as you indicated the grades to be sent straight to the university when you took the test. Just submit the rest of your application on time.\n\nThis can be a tough decision, I understand. Here's my suggestion: I would again take your old score and compare it with the statistics at the end of this post. If you do fall within the range but are in the lowest 20% of the spectrum, I would say only send it if you consistently scored very well on (legitimately taken) practice exams. (I hope you have been doing practice exams). Otherwise, just stick with your old score.\nIf you are well up in the range, just stick with your old score (why are you even re-taking the test in the first place? A 780 vs. 800 in one test is really not that important in comparison to the rest of the application, and you will only waste time and money.)\nIf your old score not even in range, send it in no matter what.\nNow in the case that you somehow do not send it, and after the deadline you realize that you have improved significantly, you should contact the admission office ASAP, explain your situation and ask about sending your score in. Most likely they will accept it if it's only a few weeks late. What do I mean by significant? Well, if you took the Physics SAT 5 times and scored 750, sent that in, and all of a sudden on your 6th try you get an 800, I still do not suggest you send the 800 in. Now if you were getting below 700 and get a 80+ pt increase, you should submit it.\n\nYes. CMU is an-score school: http://professionals.collegeboard.com/profdownload/sat-score-use-practices-list.pdf so you must submit all your scores in order to be considered for that.\n\nHere are some cases:\n1. You are an international student who has studied in a local high school, taught in the country's native language: You must take the and submit the TOEFL even if you speak English at home.\n2. You are an international student who has studied in an international high school in your country, taught in English, or in a US high school: If you believe you're really fluent in English and you have above 700 CR and Writing on the SAT, you should contact the admission office and ask to get excused from the exam.\n3. You are a US legal resident/citizen who has studied in a US school: that's unfortunate, but it has happened to me. When I was filling out either the FAFSA or some form of application, there was a question that asked what language I speak at home and I put my native language (non-English), and later I have been told I needed to take the TOEFL. I called them a bunch of times to try to get out of it with no luck. Although, granted that I did not do very well on CR, I took the TOEFL anyway and got pretty much a perfect score.\nIf you did very well on the CR, you should contact CMU and explain your situation, it might have just been a misunderstanding. Keep in mind that TOEFL is pretty expensive for an exam, so it's not a simple decision.\n\nAccording to  this thread, they do not.\n\nTo some extent, yes. You have to submit your latest high school transcript depending on the date you apply (mid-semester should probably suffice). Your final year grades honestly don't matter if you're already in, unless you fail something or go from A to C/D's in most of your classes. They will matter if you're on a late waitlist. Nevertheless, it's ok to slack off a *little* towards the end, you will need some rest before you hit college bottom. :)\n\nIt's hard. All the transfer students I've met in SCS/CIT/MCS had 4.0s in their old colleges, published papers, took a year-long hike through the Amazon Forest (not kidding), etc. You don't have to build a nuclear detector or anything, but you should really have top notch grades and some impressive project to show off. Once you figured that out, refer to the transfer information page.\n\nPersonally, I don't think it's as important as grades. However if you are within close reach of an interviewer and you are just being lazy or afraid of chatting with someone, not taking the opportunity will not help you. It's not like CMU will know, but taking a few hours of your time and showing interest does factor in to the final decision.\nIf you want more information on interviews, refer to  this thread.\n\nCMU released an interesting document that rates the importance of each admission requirement (Section C7)\nhttp://www.cmu.edu/ira/CDS/pdf/cds_2012_13/c-first-time-first-year-admission.pdf\nSo anything numerical, i.e. grades, is VERY important. The rest is just bonuses to cover for low grades or to support your outstanding self.\n\nAsk yourself how much you love CMU. If you are not very hyped about it, or it's not really your first choice school: apply RD.  Other than that, there is no harm in applying early. If you get rejected ED, you would've probably gotten rejected RD. You can also get deferred.\nIf you have some special circumstance, i.e. offered a scholarship that doesn't allow you to apply ED to any school, applying to another school that doesn't allow you to apply ED anywhere else, missing important grades, etc, then you should probably apply RD to avoid the unnecessary hassle. In any case, here are some things you should know about ED:\n1. If you just meet the requirements (ie. you're a mediocre student) then applying ED will increase your chances just by the amount of applicants considered and extra show of interest. At the same time, many bright kids will be applying ED as well, so your competition will be intense.\n2. You are given certain privilege as an ED applicant that includes full aid coverage and first pick at dorms.\n3. CMU has gotten rid of its Early Action and has only ED I.\n\nRelax because you still didn't get rejected. The best way to treat a waitlist is to do very well in your senior year and maybe do some projects on the side. If you do something significant and you believe it will be a big change in your application (winning USAMO or something), send the change in. Other than that, you should just hope for the best!\n\n Statistically speaking,  hard. (Section C2.)\n\nNot at all. If you're up for taking all the possible APs out there, go for it. However, CMU accepts pretty much only 5s, and for the full list/exceptions you can look here.\n\nUsually yes. The catch is that the class has to be on the same level as the one you're getting credit for. For instance you can't take a beginner calculus course at your college and expect to get credit for advanced calculus course at CMU. Most of the time the credit gets counted toward Free Electives and it's more strict when it comes to getting credit for Core Curriculum requirements. You have to contact your advisor to find out what exactly you get. Also, if you did not take a class at any of the Pittsburgh universities, your grade from that class is not reported: you just get the credit with a \" * \".\nLook at  this page.

With a 63.1% rate of failure on this year's test, it is obvious that the curve has become substantially worse compared to that of the former course 'AP Physics B'. The average score on AP Physics B in the past four years has consistently been approximately 2.91, whereas on AP Physics 1, the average score has now dropped to a 2.25. Understandably, such poor performance can be linked to it being the first year this exam was offered or the lack of information provided to students/educators; still, in my opinion, the data provided by Trevor Packer can be utilized to estimate the curve for this year's exam. This can better better help future students on here generally expecting a \"4/5\" to understand approximately at what level they should perform to attain such.\n\nThe AP Physics B exam had a composite of 180 (as does AP Physics 1) and generally, between 115-180 points would result in a score of 5. Between 91 and 114 would result in a score of 4. Between 63 and 90 would result in a score of 3. Between 49 and 62 would result in a score of 2, and of course, anything below this range would result in a score of 1.\n\nThe AP Physics 1 exam consists of 50 multiple choice questions followed by 5 FRQ's. Each section is weighted equally at 50%. From Dan Fullerton's posting of the free response solutions, my performance on the full practice exam (which I expect to differ slightly from that on the actual exam) and my memory of the actual exam, I am able to predict the magnitudes of this year's curve. From Dan Fullerton's solutions to the five FRQ's, I assume I answered 75% of the questions correctly. On the other hand, my performance on the CB practice multiple choice was a 20/50. I did not answer three questions at the end (multiple-select questions). I am going to assume my performance on the multiple choice questions of the real exam was approximately the same as that of the practice exam, aside from my answering of all 50 MC's. Due to the easiness of the multi-select questions on this exam, I am going to assume I answered at least three correctly. Thus, I assume about 46% of my multiple choice responses to be correct.\n\nThis information is useful assuming I am a slightly-above-average AP Physics 1 student. For the AP Physics B curve, my performance on the MC's would provide me a 75% chance of attaining a 3 (which so happened to be my score on the Physics 1 exam). Combining my performance on the FRQ's and the MC's indicates I had approximately 61% of the exam correct and scored a 3. On the AP Physics B curve, my performance on the FRQ's would have boosted my score to a 4. Note: this also indicates an increased harshness of the curve for Physics 1 that should be taken into account.\n\nIf I create a proportion such that the lowest possible percentage on Physics B to attain a 5 (64%) over the highest possible percentage to attain a 3 on Physics B (50%) is equal to a variable over my percentage on Physics 1 (61%), I can predict the minimum percentage needed on this exam to attain a 5. Here, I assume I scored a high 3 in that my percentage was somewhere near the cutoff for a 4. Solving for this variable gives 78% as the minimum percentage for a 5 on this exam. In retrospect, someone on the official thread posted a similar percentage as their teacher's prediction of the cutoff for a 5. With that said, there appears to be an incredibly narrow margin between a 3 and a 4 on this exam.\n\nTo those who scored a 3 this year on AP Physics 1, this curve estimate predicts a 75% chance on approximate of scoring at least a 4 on AP Physics B in the last 5 years or so. For those looking to attain particular scores, here are the predictions from my estimate:\n\n5: 78-100%\n4: 62-77%\n3: 43-61%\n2: 33-41%\n\nNote to those taking AP Physics 1 in the coming years: I hope you may find my estimate of the AP Physics 1 curve to be useful and beneficial. Generally, my teacher prepared me for this exam as he would AP Physics B, which is why I have a knowledge of AP Physics B's curve statistics despite taking Physics 1. While I would not recommend for you to prepare for the AP Physics B exam with Physics 1 resources now available, if you're going to take a Physics B practice test out of curiosity, you may find my curve to be useful. Let's say you take a Physics B practice test relating to the exam from 2009 at earliest, so 70 MC's and 6-7 FRQ's. If you are scoring in the higher ends of my curve, so around 77%, 61%, or 41%, you should expect your score on AP Physics 1 to differ by 75%. That means equivalently, you should be confident with 68% of Physics B to score at least a 3 and at least 40% to score at least a 2 on Physics 1 respectively. Remember 16.9% of students scored the coveted 4/5 this year with only Physics B resources available. Get to the point where you can score 100.6% of what you need to get a 5 on Physics B and utilize whatever has been made available to you. As long as the curve is consistent in the coming years (which it should be for at least 5 years), there is approximately a 75% chance you can score a 4 or a 5. I hope I have helped you in some way, shape, or form. Please provide me any questions or commentary.\n\n"}, {"date": "2013-04-04T14:26:42+00:00", "url": "http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/financial-aid-scholarships/1486647-financial-aid-faqs.html", "messages": "\n                    This Financial Aid FAQ is divided into 5 Sections: (1) Glossary / Acronyms, (2) The Basics, (3) Need-Based Aid, (4) Merit-Based Aid, (5) Residency and Independent Status, and (6) Taxes\n\nSection 1: Glossary / Acronyms\n\nFA = Financial Aid\nFAFSA = Free Application for Federal Student Aid\nEFC = Estimated Family Contribution\nCOA = Cost of Attendance\nOOS = Out-of-State\nNPC = Net Price Calculator\nNCP = Non-Custodial Parent\nHYP = Harvard, Yale, and Princeton\nUGMA = Uniform Gifts to Minors Act\nUTMA = Uniform Transfers to Minors Act\nFSEOG or SEOG= Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant\nTAP = Tuition Assistance Program (New York State)\n\nSection 2: The Basics\n\nQ: What is FAFSA?\n\nA: FAFSA is a form used to file for federal student aid. The name means Free Application for Federal Student Aid. FAFSA is not an aid program, it is just the name of the form. One of the outputs of the FAFSA is the Estimated Family Contribution, or EFC.\n\nIt is necessary to complete the FAFSA to qualify for Federal aid such as Federal Loans and Grants. It is also required by many colleges to qualify for institutional aid, however some colleges use additional or alternative forms/methods.\n\nThe FAFSA uses household income as the primary basis for EFC, meaning the income of one or two parents and the student.\n\nThe FAFSA determines your eligiblity to receive federal aid: including Pell grants, FSEOG grants , Federal Work Study and Federal Student Loans (subsidized/unsubsidized Stafford loans and Perkins loans). The FAFSA is required by all public colleges and universities and a large number of private schools require the FAFSA (some in addition to other FA forms).\n\nYou can find the FAFSA and related information here: Home - FAFSA on the Web-Federal Student Aid\n\nQ: What is EFC?\n\nA: EFC, Estimated Family Contribution, is an output from the FAFSA. The Difference between college Cost of Attendance (COA) and EFC determines eligibility for Federal Aid, such as Federal Loans and Grants. The EFC may also be used by colleges to determine Financial Need.\n\nYou can get an estimate of your EFC by using the FAFSA4caster: FAFSA4caster\n\nQ: What is the Cost of Attendance (COA)?\n\nA: The cost of attendance it is the total projected amount it will cost to attend a particular school.\n\nDirect Costs: The first part of the cost of attendance usually lists the tuition, fees and room and board. These costs are paid directly to the college.\n\nIndirect costs: The other costs listed are usually for books, transportation and personal expenses. These costs vary from student to student.\n\nYou can control indirect costs - that is, your costs could be less than the estimated indirect costs. If so, your real costs may be less than estimated COA. If you are not careful, your real costs could be more than estimated COA. In addition, if your school charges by the credit hour, COA may be estimated on a lower number of credits than you will actually be taking - in which case, your actual tuition & fees may be more than the estimate used in the COA - so your COA could be higher than the estimate.\n\nQ: What is my Financial Need?\n\nA: For Federal Aid, the student's Financial Need is determined by subtracting the Estimated Family Contribution (EFC) from the college Cost of Attendance (COA). If the COA is $30,000 and the EFC is $5,000, then the Financial Need is $25,000.\n\nMany colleges use the same formula to determine Financial Need, but most colleges do not promise to meet all need.  Your financial need as calculated by a particular college can be very different from the Federal financial need.\n\nIf you do not receive aid totaling your Need, you are \"gapped\" --- and you will have to figure out how to finance the gap.\n\nQ: What is the Net Price Calculator (NPC)?\n\nA: Each college that participates in Federal Aid programs is required by law to provide a Net Price Calculator for prospective students to use to estimate what the college will cost, including projected financial aid. There are significant variations in how the Net Price Calculators work and the accuracy of the results they give.  It is best to be as accurate as possible when filling it out so you get an accurate result.\n\nMore information on NPCs can be found here:  Net Price Calculators\n\nMost NPCs estimate only need-based aid, however some include estimates of merit-based aid as well.\n\nQ: What is the CSS/Profile?\n\nA: Approximately 400 schools use the CSS/Profile to gather additional financial information in order to grant their own institutional aid.\n\nUnlike FAFSA, the CSS Profile is not free. The cost to file the CSS profile is $25 for the first school and $16 for each additional school.\n\nIf you attend a one of these schools, they use a combination of both the Federal Methodology (FM) and Institutional Methodology (IM).\n\nMany schools that use a Federal Methodology to determine EFC will require only the FAFSA. Schools that use an Intuitional Methodology or a combination of the 2 will require the CSS/Profile or their own FA forms.\n\nDifferences between the IM and FM models are\n\n\u0095\tIM collects information on estimated academic year family income, medical expenses, elementary and secondary school tuition and unusual circumstances. FM omits these questions.\n\u0095\tIM considers a fuller range of family asset information, while FM ignores assets of siblings, all assets of certain families with less than $50,000 of income, and both home and family farm equity.\n\u0095\tFM defines income as the \u0093adjusted gross income\u0094 on federal tax returns, plus various categories of untaxed income. IM includes in total income any paper depreciation, business, rental or capital losses which artificially reduce adjusted gross income.\n\u0095\tFM does not assume a minimum student contribution to education; IM expects the student, as primary beneficiary of the education, to devote some time each year to earning money to pay for education.\n\u0095\tFM ignores the noncustodial parent in cases of divorce or separation; IM expects parents to help pay for education, regardless of current marital status.\n\u0095\tFM and IM apply different percentages to adjust the parental contribution when multiple siblings are simultaneously enrolled in college, and IM considers only siblings enrolled in undergraduate programs.\n\u0095\tThe IM expected family share represents a best estimate of a family\u0092s capacity (relative to other families) to absorb, over time, the costs of education. It is not an assessment of cash on hand, a value judgment about how much a family should be able to use current income, or a measure of liquidity. The final determinations of demonstrated need and awards rest with the University and are based upon a uniform and consistent treatment of family circumstances.\n\u0095\tExcept in the most extraordinary circumstances, Colleges classifies incoming students as dependent upon parents for institutional aid purposes, even though some students may meet the federal definition of \u0093independence.\u0094\n\u0095\tThe profile will take into consideration tuition for children attending high school. They may consider school expenses outside of high school for special needs children. They will consider unreimbursed medical expenses and taking care of elderly parents.\n\nSection 3: Need-Based Aid\n\nQ: Which colleges give the best aid / claim to meet full need?\n\nA: Here is the list of colleges that claim to meet full need:\n\nColleges That Claim to Meet the Full Financial Needs of Students - US News and World Report\n\nQ: If my EFC is zero does that mean I can go to college for free?\n\nA: Generally speaking, no.  There are a limited number of colleges that will meet the full need of every student, and those colleges generally use methods other than FAFSA EFC to determine need.  A zero EFC means you are eligible for many Federal and State Aid programs, but these may not provide enough assistance to pay for college and will likely include loans.\n\nQ: Why isn't the FAFSA fair (because I am remarried, divorced, single, cohabitating, etc)?\n\nA: Like many programs administered by the federal government, the results of the FAFSA may not seem fair or equitable to each individual.  It is possible to get more individualized, special case consideration from the financial aid offices of individual schools.\n\nQ: How do I find out what I need to submit to the colleges and the deadlines to apply for financial aid?\n\nA: Each college has a financial aid section on their website. Go to that section. If you are an incoming freshman, look for that section. It will tell you everything you need to submit, and the deadlines for submission. It will also give you the school codes for the FAFSA and the Profile (if your school requires it).\n\nCheck EACH college website for your schools as these vary wildly from school to school.\n\nQ: What is the effect of merit aid on my need-based aid award?\n\nA: At the majority of schools, outside merit aid reduces your COA, so the college will possibly reduce your need-based aid by that amount. How they do that varies, but often begins with removing subsidization of Stafford loans, elimination of work study, then grants, etc. Consult your FA office at each institution for details, only they know the answer, and get it in writing if possible.\n\nQ: My parents are divorced and my dad won't fill out the Non-Custodial Parent info that my school requires for Financial Aid consideration. He pays child support and I see him a couple of times per month, but he doesn't want to pay for college. Can I get a waiver so that I don't need to use his financial info? If I can get that waiver, then I should get a lot of aid because my mom makes about $40k per year, while my dad makes $150k.\n\nA: Not likely. Those waivers are typically for cases where the NCP has not been in the child's life for years, hasn't paid child support, and (likely) you have no means to contact him. They aren't intended for parents who just don't want to pay - otherwise all parents would just opt not to pay.\n\nQ: My parents are divorced. Which parent do I use for my FAFSA?\n\nA: For FAFSA purposes, you must use the parent with whom you have lived the most in the past 12 months. It doesn't matter which parent claims you as a dependent for income tax purposes, and it doesn't matter which parent earns more money. If, however, you have lived with both parents exactly the same number of days in the past 12 months, you will use the parent who provides more support - and that is most likely the parent who earns more.\n\nQ: What if my biological parents never married?\n\nUse the parent with whom you lived the most in the past 12 months. If you live with both, you will use the parent who earns more money. If they never married, indicate that your parent is Single.\n\nQ: I filled out my FAFSA, but I didn't get any financial aid.  Why not?\n\nA: You do not get financial aid merely by filling out a FAFSA. Filling out a FAFSA does, however, allow you to find out what types of federal aid you may qualify to receive from colleges. Every student is eligible for at least $5,500 in Federal Direct Unsubsidized Loans. This IS financial aid. For many students, this may be the only financial aid for which they qualify. The only way to know for sure what your awards will be at a given school is to send your FAFSA to that school, complete all requirements the school may have for aid recipients, and wait for an award letter.\n\nQ: Am I likely to get good financial aid if I'm a Transfer student?\n\nA: No (of course depending on the particular college). Colleges spend most of their financial aid funding trying to attract the freshman year candidates that they desire.\n\nQ: Am I likely to get good financial aid if I'm a Waitlisted student?\n\nA: You may well get decent financial aid. If you applied for financial aid, colleges know you need help and if they're going to their wait lists they want to secure a student as soon as possible--they don't want to have to go to the next tier, etc.\n\nQ: I am an International student, do I get the same financial aid as US students?\n\nA: In general, no.  At some of the most well-endowed, selective colleges international students are eligible for the same or similar aid as US students. Most colleges reserve financial aid for US students.\n\nQ: I applied to School X because it has a reputation for giving lots of need-based financial aid, however I didn't get any. Why not?\n\nA: It may surprise some people, but even the schools that give the best aid (Harvard, Yale, Stanford, etc) won't give significant aid if your family's income and assets are too high. There are many full pay students attending those schools.\n\nQ: My EFC is 0, yet when I got my FA package from the OOS flagship that accepted me, I only got a $5500 Pell Grant and a $5500 student loan. The cost is over $40k. Why didn't they give me the money to attend this school? Do they really expect my low income single mom to pay $40k per year? She only earns $20k.\n\nA: No, the school doesn't expect your family to pay. They expect that you're going to either decline or that you have another source of money (Non custodial parent, grandparents, etc).\n\nAn OOS public usually doesn't have the institutional funds to give you the aid that you need. These schools usually expect OOS students to bring in money to the school. If they covered need with aid, they wouldn't bother to charge the high OOS costs.\n\nQ: My dream school is Harvard, but I just saw online that it costs nearly $60,000 to go there! This is crazy! How can anyone besides millionaires afford this school?\n\nA: Many families pay significantly less than the \"sticker price\" at the most expensive schools like Harvard. Ivy League universities and similar caliber schools offer very generous financial aid, and promise to meet 100% of financial need. This might not make the school completely affordable, especially in unique situations, but it goes a long way.\n\nQ: I plan to apply for financial aid. Will colleges discriminate against me because I can't afford to pay?\n\nA: Maybe. Some schools say they are \"need-blind\" and will not consider your ability to pay in making an admissions decision, while others are \"need-aware\" and might consider this. The most generous colleges tend to be need-blind, but just because a school is need-blind doesn't mean they will give you enough financial aid to allow you to go. On the other hand, a need-aware school could still give you a very generous scholarship.\n\nQ: What is Preferential Packaging?\n\nA: Some colleges distribute aid based not only on \u0093need\u0094 but also on the desirability of the candidate.\n\nAn example from Muhlenberg College (who openly state that they practice preferential packaging):\n\n\nQ: Why do colleges give out financial aid at all? Why don't they just take rich students and make a lot of money?\n\nA: There are basically two answers to this question.\n\nFirst of all, non-profit colleges don't exist to make money. They do need money to operate their programs, but they are happy to give out the surplus of their huge endowments to help needy and deserving students get an education.\n\nSecond, and more cynically, colleges achieve a lot of institutional goals through financial aid. It allows them to attract top students who might otherwise turn them down for cheaper schools, which increases both their admitted student GPA and test score ranges along with their yield, which helps them rise in the rankings. This is especially true in the case of second- and third-tier schools that offer generous merit aid, in the hopes of attracting students who might otherwise go to a more well-known school.\n\nQ: What are UGMA and UTMA accounts?\n\nA: The Uniform Gifts and Uniform Transfers to Minors Acts (UGMA and UTMA) allow the establishment of an account for gifts of cash and financial assets for a minor without the expense of creating a trust. Because the minor is the owner of the account, it counts as his asset on the FAFSA, not the asset of the custodian, who is often the parent.\n\nIn other words, the UGMA/UTMA will affect the student's assets in the calculation. 20% of the student's assets count toward the EFC. However, if the parents qualify for simplified needs or automatic 0 EFC formula, both the parents' and the student's assets are ignored when computing the EFC.\n\nQ: I have an EFC according to the FAFSA of around $80k. I submitted the CSS Profile tonight to my schools. I doubt I'll get aid. Was this a mistake in terms of admissions? Is having a need of \"0\" just like checking that \"I do not plan on applying for need-based aid\"? It's a plus if a school is need aware, right?\n\nA: No this was not a \"mistake\" in terms of admissions.\n\n\u0093Need blind\u0094 is a part of the admissions process. Need blind means that the admitting institution does not consider an applicant's financial situation when deciding admission. Most schools are need blind to US citizens and US permanent residents.\n\nMeeting demonstrated need is a financial aid process. Any school that does not meet 100% demonstrated need is known to gap. It is up to the family to fill the gap they best way that they can. If your family has an EFC of 80k, in the eyes of the college financial aid office, your family has the income/assets to pay the full freight for you to attend college and you will not require any of the school's financial resources.\n\nThis could be a plus at schools that are need aware or need sensitive especially where a school has at the end of their financial aid budget. When it comes to choosing between 2 similarly qualified applicants, the tip will go to the student who needs less of the school's financial resources.\n\nQ: Why does FAFSA ask for info on cash, savings, and checking? My checking account obviously fluctuates each month based upon the day. If I submit my FAFSA on the first day after I have deposited a paycheck, it is clearly much higher than toward the end of the month.\n\nA: FAFSA is a snapshot in time. Time it well!\n\nQ: If I qualify for the Simplified Needs Test why is FAFSA asking me about my assets? I thought there was skip-logic.\n\nA: Some states require that information for state grants.\n\nQ: What types of Federal Aid are available?\n\nA: Need can be met through grants (Pell, SEOG, institutional), federal work study, subsidized Stafford loans, and/or Perkins loans. If your EFC qualifies you for a Pell grant, you will get that grant. No other grants are guaranteed. SEOG is a limited pot of money awarded to your school by the government, and they divvy it up among their neediest students; missing a priority financial aid deadline can jeopardize your ability to get an SEOG grant you might otherwise have received. You will receive a subsidized Stafford if you have sufficient Need (determined by COA-EFC-scholarships-grants-Federal Work Study-Perkins), up to the maximum allowed for year in school ($3500 freshman/$4500 sophomore/$5500 junior & senior). Perkins loans are limited - not all schools have Perkins loans, and even at schools that have them only a limited number of students will be awarded Perkins loans. Federal Work Study is also limited, and schools can't always award FWS to all students who have Need --- and jobs are not guaranteed. You cannot subtract the FWS award amount from your bill, because it is an earn-as-you-go award (think of it as spending money if you can get an FWS job).\n\nEligibility for an unsubsidized loan is determined by COA-all other aid (scholarships, grants, loans, federal work study). You can receive up to the maximum amount for your year in school in a combination of subsidized and unsubsidized loans. For example, a freshman dependent student can receive $5500 in a combination of sub and unsub loans. If there is sufficient need to receive the full $3500 sub eligibility as a freshman, the student can receive another $2000 in unsub. If the Need remaining for sub loans is only $2000, the student can receive $3500 in unsub loans. If the student does not have enough Need for any sub loans, the student can receive $5500 in unsub loans. Even if a student is not awarded unsub, he/she can request it from the financial aid office as long as the total of all other aid does not exceed the COA. Note: Some schools do not participate in Stafford loan programs - no sub or unsub.\n\nParent PLUS loans are not guaranteed; they are subject to a credit check. Students whose parents apply for and are denied a parent PLUS loan can borrow additional unsub (up to $4000 freshman/sophomore, up to $5000 junior/senior). If a parent is denied the PLUS, the student will not get more than this extra unsub ... this is very important to understand. Students must request to receive the additional unsub due to PLUS denial; it is not automatically done, although some schools may ask if the student wants the additional unsub in case of a denial right on the parent PLUS application.\n\nThe current origination fee for sub & unsub loans is 1%; it may rise this spring due to the Congressional sequestor.\n\nQ: How is aid paid out?  All at once?  By semesters?\n\nA: Aid is generally split equally between the semesters/trimesters/quarters. There may be some particular scholarships that are not, but federal aid & most institutional aid is split equally. If a student is eligible for a loan but does not take it in the first semester, the student can generally get the full amount of loan eligibility in the second semester. If the student is not eligible in the first semester (didn't meet SAP, didn't enroll at least half time, etc), loan eligibility is calculated using a single semester COA - so while the student would be eligible for the full annual amount, it might be limited by a lower COA.\n\nQ: I\u0092m a graduate student \u0096 does aid work the same for me?\n\nQ: Graduate students are not eligible for federal grants. Some schools do have federal work study for grad students, but many do not. Grad students are not eligible for subsidized loans. Grad students are eligible for up to $20,500 in unsubsidized loans per year - they may also apply for Grad PLUS loans up to the COA, but those are not guaranteed; they are credit based. Certain health professions have higher loan limits for unsub loans (such as med students & pharm students).\n\nSection 4: Merit Aid\n\nQ: I\u0092m going to College X in the fall, but I didn\u0092t get as much aid as I wanted.  Where can I find scholarships to pay for school?\n\nA: The best place to get scholarships is from colleges that award merit-based aid.  Most external scholarships either have a need-based component and/or are not renewable for four years.  Merit-based awards from colleges do not have a requirement for \u0093need\u0094 and most are renewable for 4 years of college (but note that renewal is often based on meeting a certain GPA threshold.)\nWhen it comes to merit aid, planning and research are necessary to put their odds in your favor.  Colleges that award academic merit aid give it to a fraction of students at the top of the admitted pool.  Students looking for large merit awards must target schools where their academic stats will stand out.\n\nQ: What colleges give the best merit aid / where can I find merit aid?\n\nA: Here are some threads that provide information in this area:\n\nhttp://talk.collegeconfidential.com/financial-aid-scholarships/1461983-competitive-full-tuition-full-ride-scholarships.html\n\nhttp://talk.collegeconfidential.com/financial-aid-scholarships/1348012-automatic-full-tuition-full-ride-scholarships.html\n\nhttp://talk.collegeconfidential.com/national-merit-scholarships/649276-nmf-scholarships-updated-compilation.html\n\nhttp://talk.collegeconfidential.com/financial-aid-scholarships/848226-important-links-automatic-guaranteed-merit-scholarships.html?highlight=automatic\n\nQ: I applied to School X because it has a reputation for giving lots of merit aid, however I didn't get any. Why not?\n\nA: When people say that School X gives a lot of merit aid, they don't mean to every student. A school would just lower its tuition if that were the case. Merit scholarships are generally given to those whose stats are within the top 1-25% of the applicant pool.\n\nSection 5: Residency and Independent Status\n\nQ:I want to go to an out-of-state public school and pay in-state tuition.  How can I do this?  (Many variations on this question, such \u0093Can I use a relative\u0092s address?\u0094 \u0093Can I move there for the summer before school and work?\u0094, etc.)\n\nA: In almost all cases, in-state tuition is for students who have lived in the state and graduated from high school in the state.  There is no easy trick to become eligible for in-state tuition in a state other than your own.\n\nThere are some exceptions to this rule.  For example, there are Tuition Exchange Programs and Waivers based on geography and/or agreements between states that will either reduce or eliminate out-of-state tuition.  Some examples:\n\n\u0095\tWestern Undergraduate Exchange (WUE) | Western Interstate Commission for Higher Education\n\u0095\tAcademic Common Market\n\u0095\tMHEC : Student Access: Midwest Student Exchange Program (1)\n\u0095\tOverview : New England Board of Higher Education\n\nAlso check with individual schools \u0096 some also allow in-state rates to be paid by students from neighboring states or counties.\n\nAnother exception is merit-based out-of-state tuition waivers, which allow students with a certain GPA and/or ACT/SAT score to have their out-of-state tuition waived.\n\nThere are also some states that charge very low out-of-state tuition, such as Minnesota.\n\nSee also: Guide to State Residency\n\nQ: Can I declare myself an independent student to get more aid? (Because my parents make too much money to get financial aid, etc.)\n\nA: In general, no, it is not possible to declare yourself independent from your parents in order to be eligible for more financial aid.\n\nThe specific circumstances where you can be an independent student are given here: Will I need my parent\u0092s information?\n\nYou must be able to answer YES to one of these questions to be an independent student:\n\n1.\tWere you 23 years old on January 1st of [this school year]?\n2.\tAs of today are you married?\n3.\tAt the beginning of [next] school year, will you be working on a master's or doctorate program (such as an MA, MBA, MD, JD, PhD, EdD, or graduate certificate, etc.)?\n4.\tAre you currently serving on active duty in the U.S. Armed Forces for purposes other than training?\n5.\tAre you a veteran of the U.S. Armed Forces?\n6.\tDo you have children who will receive more than half of their support from you between July 1 [summer before next school year] and June 30 [summer after next school year]?\n7.\tDo you have dependents (other than your children or spouse) who live with you and who receive more than half of their support from you, now and through June 30 [summer after next school year]?\n8.\tAt any time since you turned age 13, were both your parents deceased, were you in foster care or were you a dependent or ward of the court?\n9.\tAs determined by a court in your state of legal residence, are you or were you an emancipated minor?\n10.\tAs determined by a court in your state of legal residence, are you or were you in legal guardianship?\n11.\tAt any time on or after July 1 [before this school year], did your high school or school district homeless liaison determine that you were an unaccompanied youth who was homeless?\n12.\tAt any time on or after July 1 [before this school year], did the director of an emergency shelter or transitional housing program funded by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development determine that you were an unaccompanied youth who was homeless?\n13.\tAt any time on or after July 1 [before this school year], did the director of a runaway or homeless youth basic center or transitional living program determine that you were an unaccompanied youth who was homeless or were self-supporting and at risk of being homeless?\n\nQ: Can I change to independent status after I start school?\n\nA: Students enrolling as dependent students are considered dependent throughout their undergraduate years when need for institutional scholarships is determined.\nFor institutional aid purposes a student may not \u0093declare\u0094 independence due to attainment of legal age, internal family arrangements, marriage or family disagreements.\n\nSection 6: Taxes\n\nQ: Is my scholarship/grant taxable income?\n\nA: Scholarships and grants that cover tuition, fees, and books are not taxable income.  Scholarships and grants covering room and board are taxable income and must be included on the student\u0092s income tax return.  Scholarship and grant money spent on other mandatory expenses may also be exempt from taxation (see: Tax Topics - Topic 421 Scholarship and Fellowship Grants).  Your college should provide you with a 1098T Form to guide you on filing your taxes, although these forms need to be checked for accuracy.\n\nQ: My college recorded three semesters of tuition on Form 1098T. Am I allowed to keep track of expenses based on Jan 1 through Dec 31 tax year for the American Opportunity Credit?\n\nA: Absolutely. The information on the 1098T is what the college has to report to the feds, but this report may have precious little correspondence with what you actually paid in qualified expenses. Print out the Bursar's statement that shows when items were billed and when they were recorded as paid, and pull together all of your records for qualified items (books, required course materials and equipment, etc.) that weren't billed through the college. That is what you will use for the AOC.\n\nQ: I just started college at the community college and I have a scholarship so I only paid for my books. I only have like maybe $400 to claim for the AOC. Can I wait and file later?\n\nA: Sort of. Most students are in college for four academic years, and those four academic years are often spread out over five tax years. (Fall 2013, Spring 1014 & Fall 2014, Spring 2015 & Fall 2015, Spring 2016 & Fall 2016, Spring 2017). You can claim the AOC for only four tax years, and only those tax years in which you are still classified as an undergraduate. So if your first semester is super cheap (and congratulations by the way!!), but you expect that you will have an expensive last semester, you can wait to claim the AOC until the second tax year you are in college.

But I am just so tired of this college craze. I feel like I have to manipulate my way into college or something. Everything I do has to be thought over a couple of billion times. I have to tell all my interviewers their college is my first choice (what did they expect when they asked me this question?), think clearly about what order to rank my schools when asked, even the FAFSA is some kind of scheme for the adcom to figure out whether they're your top choice. I basically have to second-guess every little thing a college tells me (Are they REALLY need-blind? Do interviews REALLY not matter?) and spend hours scrutinizing over every little thing I send to colleges so that they feel raised on a pedestal. Honestly, who ACTUALLY has a first choice? People would be happy just attending a school they perceive as prestigious. \"First choice\" doesn't even matter. In the end, it's all still a toss-up so why do colleges care so much?\n\nSeveral of my friends got into their top choices even though they derped their way through high school - maybe because the schools don't need to give them thousands in aid, or because they're a legacy. I'll never know why, actually. Not that I'm not glad that they're living the dream. But I probably wouldn't need to fake this act of being the happiest friend on earth if I too got a satisfactory result or if I felt they actually DESERVED it.\n\nI'm not actually as angry as I sound in this post. I'm just so annoyed. I don't want to waste all this effort being meticulous and OCD and trying to perfect everything and working so hard for four years just to not get great results.\n\nThis whole ordeal is so stupid.                "}, {"date": "2014-05-15T15:55:15+00:00", "url": "http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/athletic-recruits/1650739-what-ive-learned-about-rowing-recruiting.html", "messages": "\n                    I posted the following as a reply in another thread yesterday, but figured that I'd repost my response under a new thread and title, so that more people who are thinking about rowing in college might find it. (Hence the sixth paragraph which addresses the original poster regarding their bad luck with Stamford rowing.) This originally appeared as a response to the thread titled, \"Someone help me understand.\"\n\n\"With two kids recruited to D1 rowing programs, I've figured out a few things -\n\n- Coaches want the best possible recruits. They are only interested in your academics in terms of whether they can get you through admissions. They care about your erg times, your height & your results - in that order. (in my opinion)\nErg times are their only objective measure of your potential abilities. (It seems that the kids with the most recruiting options & success on my kids' teams have had the best erg scores, not necessarily the top results on the team.)\nResults are dependent on many other factors, primarily the rest of the rowers in the boat with you. Certainly top finishes at the most competitive regattas are considered and the best recruits usually have good results. That being said, coaches believe that they can teach a kid to have better form, but they can't teach strength & size. Coaches also understand that if you're in a small program, your race results may be restricted by the limitations of your team, hence once again, the importance of your erg time.\n\nRemember a coach will opt for the best possible athletic recruit EVEN IF THAT ATHLETE APPEARS AT THE VERY END OF THE RECRUITING PROCESS! That means where you are ranked on a coach's priority list is fluid and can change at any time. On the other hand, if their top recruits fall through - they may decide they want and need you, even if they've seemed somewhat lukewarm. So hang in there and maintain contact with coaches of teams you are interested in - you never know. This is true of all programs from the top ranked on down. Never forget that a coach's job success is judged by their team's results, not your grade in chemistry or how much they like you as a person.\n\n- The Ivies all need to have teams that meet a certain academic average. This means that they need athletes that can balance out top recruits that may have a relatively low AI. (Remember, this is not a helmet sport, so there isn't that much leeway) So, if you have outstanding academics AND fit their athlete profile with regard to erg time, height & results, a borderline athlete may be pulled in. Pay attention to which ivy teams are less competitive - they may be your best bet if you're a borderline recruit, but fit the ivy academic profile comfortably.\n\n- Be realistic and ask coaches direct questions that will give you a sense of your chances.\n*** Ask the range of erg times for last year's recruiting class.\nIf the slowest time is 5 or 10 seconds faster than you - pay attention. If your times don't drop, your chances are poor, no matter how good your academics are. (Erg times should be verifiable - at an official indoor competition or at least by your current coach.)\nIn rowing, height matters so that rowers in their boats match up. Some coaches are more willing to overlook a smaller rower if they believe the athlete is a good recruit. If you are somewhat height challenged, relatively speaking, ask if they've got athletes on their team that are your height. (Usually you can find heights listed on the profiles of the current team roster.)\nFinally, ask how many slots the coach has for the upcoming recruiting class and how many they had last year. Some will have just a couple of slots and some may have as many as 10. The strength of the team is not necessarily an indication of how many slots they receive.\n\n- The amount of pull that a coach has with their admissions office will vary from school to school. It depends upon how how highly rowing is prioritized by the admissions & athletic departments. This means that a top rowing recruit may actually have a better chance at gaining admittance at a more academically competitive school that prioritizes rowing.\n\n* With regard to Stamford rowing, unfortunately your story is not totally unfamiliar. As I recall, there were some woman rowers that believed that they'd been promised slots on the Stamford women's team about 3 years ago. These were top recruits, who had options to be recruited at other academically outstanding schools. They found themselves without a spot and scrambling at the last minute. The shame was that by the time they were denied admission, their options were limited by the fact that many schools had completed their recruiting.\nIf my rower was athletically and academically in the running to be considering Stamford, I'd be wary, because it appears that Stamford rowing coaches have had problems with predicting admissions outcomes for some of their recruits.\n\nThis can be an important lesson with regard to all rowing recruits - if the coach is not able to produce a likely letter (ivy) or a letter of intent - proceed with caution. It may be worth it to choose a school that it willing to offer some sort of official assurance. Understand that not all schools and teams offer either of these. It's your job to figure out which schools that match your interests & athletic abilities that do and make informed decisions. There are lots of great schools with rowing teams that may not offer either. I don't mean to suggest that they shouldn't be considered, just that you should understand the recruiting process at the schools that you're interested in. Is it worth it to gamble on a college that won't provide you with a \"likely letter\" or a letter of intent, over a school that will?\nI believe that it isn't unreasonable to ask a coach directly if they've had athletes that have been denied admission, even after admissions has indicated that their recruits should get through. The truth is, unless you've got something in writing, don't count on it.\n\nSorry for the ramble, but I wish I'd been able to read something like this post when my family was first embarking on the recruiting process. I hope that this will be useful to someone who is starting now.\"                "}, {"date": "2014-06-03T16:54:45+00:00", "url": "http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/university-mississippi/1655760-why-our-son-chose-ole-miss.html", "messages": "\n                    My son finally decided on Ole Miss. Actually he decided a while ago, it was my wife and I who were doubtful. I thought I would post our thought processes in case it might be helpful to others.\n\nIn the beginning he had three main criteria that he was looking for:\n\n1. A Computer Science major;\n2. A Linguistics major;\n3. Separate men's and women's dorms, with a policy against overnight visitation by the opposite sex.\n\n(Some people may wonder whether no. 3 was actually his choice or his parents'. You're going to have to take my word for it that it was his, although my wife and I certainly supported it.)\n\nHe was a National Merit Finalist, so we identified the schools that gave full ride scholarships to NMFs. Once we had that list, we narrowed it down to those that had both the majors he wanted. This left only Ole Miss and Kentucky (most of the others lacked the Linguistics major). After visiting both those schools, he was pretty much undecided between them. The thing that swayed him was the fact that Ole Miss has the policy against overnight visitation by the opposite sex, and Kentucky doesn't.\n\nHe also applied to some higher-ranked schools that met his criteria, but that did not offer NMF full ride scholarships. But in the end, he liked Ole Miss enough that he didn't feel it was worth the extra cost to attend those other schools, solely on the basis of higher rankings.\n\nOklahoma made a last-minute effort to snag him with their NMF package, and that's what made my wife and I unsure about Ole Miss. But as generous as OU's NMF package is, it was still going to leave him about $20,000 in debt after graduation, whereas with Ole Miss he'll graduate debt-free.\n\nThe funny thing about OU is that they have enormously high fees. A parent here on CC told me that a few years ago, OU started raising its fees rather than tuition, because it wanted to be able to claim that it was holding the line on tuition increases. Admittedly this is thirdhand info, so take it for what it's worth. But I know, from the documentation they provided us, that their yearly fees are in the neighborhood of $5,000, whereas fees at other colleges are only a few hundred.\n\nOU's NMF package includes a tuition waiver, but not a fee waiver. So as those fees increase every year, the increases were going to come out of our pockets. We also would have had to eat any increases in room and board costs, since those are not waived either -- they provide scholarships that you can apply towards room and board, but they are fixed amounts and do not increase to cover yearly inflation. Whereas Ole Miss waives tuition and fees, as well as housing costs, no matter how much they increase year by year.\n\nAs far as rankings go, Ole Miss is at a bit of a disadvantage in that it is required to accept all in-state students with a GPA of 2.5 or better and 760 or better on the SAT. These requirements are appallingly low. I did some research and found out that this is a result of a lawsuit filed some 30 years ago, which was eventually settled. One of the provisions of the settlement was that all state universities in Mississippi must have uniform admissions standards. The reason being that before this, the vast majority of black students were being funneled into the historically black colleges, which had lower admissions standards, the result of which was de facto segregation. By making admissions standards uniform, the idea was to get a more diverse student body. It seems to be working, since Ole Miss's black enrollment is now at an all-time high of 17%.\n\nThe more highly ranked members of the SEC have competitive admissions, or higher minimum admissions standards, whereas Ole Miss has to take all in-state students who meet these minimal requirements. This of course lowers its acceptance rate, graduation rate, average SAT scores, etc., all of which affect its US News ranking. With all this taken into consideration, it actually seems impressive that Ole Miss manages to rank as high as it does. It is, after all, ranked higher than many colleges that are allowed to have competitive admissions.\n\nAll in all, we're happy with our son's choice. We found Ole Miss to be a beautiful, friendly place and we're confident that they'll let him go as far as his talents and efforts can take him.

If you're a planner (like I am), having a binder for your student to keep up with everything will be helpful.\n\n\nBeginning July 1\n\nApplication for admission, $40 application fee.\nSubmit transcripts, ACT, and or SAT.  Be sure to submit a test that includes\nWriting score.  Priority deadline is February 1.\n\nStudent tab appears.  CWID issued.  Acceptance letter arrives via mail.\n\nScholarship letter arrives.  Letter from college of choice arrives.\n\nApply to Honors College \u2013 once accepted, students who qualify may apply for admission to the Honors College.  Admission is based solely upon stats, so the application is pretty simple.  Any student who wishes to live in Honors housing must have applied and been accepted BEFORE room selection begins on May 1, so don\u2019t delay in applying.\n\nScholarship application \u2013 once a student is accepted, the scholarship application is available to complete online.  The scholarship application deadline is December 15.  Don\u2019t plan to wait until the last minute.  The system may experience an overload and you may have an issue submitting at the last minute.  The national December ACT test date and the national December SAT test date are the last test dates accepted for scholarships.  The highest qualifying test score will be used to determine the scholarship level awarded.  Although students receive a scholarship letter earlier, the official acceptance occurs in the spring on MyBama.\n\nPay enrollment deposit online.  Enrollment deposit is $200 and is non-refundable.  Be aware that the system may take several hours to update before allowing the housing deposit to be submitted.  Allow at least two hours or more between paying the enrollment deposit and housing deposit.\n\nCheck into special programs of interest such as Emerging Scholars, University Scholars, CBH, UFE.  Note requirements and deadlines.\n\nBeginning October 1\n\nPay housing deposit and complete the housing contract.  Housing deposit is $300 and up to $275 is refundable as long as it is requested in writing until May 1, or $175 before June 1.  The earlier the deposit is paid the better your chances of receiving your choice of housing.  Students are not guaranteed a particular housing option.  The deadline for submitting the housing deposit is April 1.\n\nSet up a roommate profile and begin searching for potential roommates.  If I recall correctly, the system updates weekly.  It is possible that this has changed, so check it often.  For the best result in finding compatible roommates, the student (not the parent) should complete the profile with complete honesty.  No one wants to find out the neat, non-smoking, non-partying roommate choice is actually an all night party animal or visa versa.:)   Don\u2019t worry about being judged.  Be yourself and find the best fit for you.  Keep in mind that roommates don\u2019t have to be best friends or carbon copies to live together.\n\nIf your student is NMSF, verify that all steps for completing the process are completed before the deadline.\n\nBama Bound \u2013 students can register for Bama Bound after paying the enrollment and housing deposit.  The deposit for Bama Bound is $120 for the student.  Students usually reside in the dorm during Bama Bound.  Parents have the option of paying to stay in the dorm also.  Parents are usually assigned to a different tower within RCS.  Sibling orientation is also available for an additional cost for students with siblings.  I think siblings have to be a high school freshman or older to participate.\n\nWhere should I live?\nDetermine interest and investigate deadlines for any living-learning community for which a student may have interest.  Acceptance into Honors is required before selecting Honors housing.  Students may also want to consider other communities such as Blount, which require an application process.\n\nHere\u2019s a link about living-learning communities:\nhttp://housing.ua.edu/new_students/living_learning_halls.cfm\n\nLink to residence hall options:\nhttp://housing.ua.edu/halls/\n\n\nConsider whether you\u2019ll participate in Alabama Action, Outdoor Action, or Camp 1831.  Watch for online applications to open and submit the deposit and criminal background check online.\n\nMarch 1\nPriority deadline for submitting Financial Aid forms.\n\nBeginning as early as May 1 (depending on date of deposit)\nRoom Selection \u2013 students who wish to select roommates should have already made connections using the Roommate Finder or other alternatives.  Students are able to select roommates, building, floor, suite, and bedroom during room selection IF they met the deadlines.\n\nJune 1\n\nFootball tickets generally go on sale online around this time for entering freshman.  Students go online to purchase one of two packages available to incoming freshmen.\n\nMove in time selection.  Watch for the deadline to sign up for a move in time.  Those participating in approved activities are allowed to move in early.  Move in times slots are generally staggered incrementally and based upon the building/floor of the housing assignment.  Students go online on a specified date to select their actual move in time.  Move in at the UA is an amazing process.  I promise you will be impressed.\n\nParking permits \u2013 these go on sale online at some point during the summer for students who plan to bring cars.  Watch the Crimson mail for assigned times to purchase parking permits.  If bringing a car from out of state, check with your state to see if the car will need an inspection or if a waiver is available.  Most states allow waivers.\n\nImmunizations \u2013 download the immunization form and make an appointment for immunizations and TB skin test.  The form may be submitted during Bama Bound.  Remember to allow time for the TB test to be administered AND read.\n\nDuring the summer:\n\nSet appointments for routine visits to orthodontists, dentists, ophthalmologist, dermatologist, etc. and have any prescriptions refilled.  Consider a basic first aid kit with any allergy and cold meds your student may need.  Students under 19 are prohibited from buying certain prescriptions in Alabama.\n\nRegister to vote and request absentee ballots if planning to vote in your home state.\n\nSend final transcript to the UA upon graduation.\n\nSend AP scores, dual enrollment transcripts, CLEP results to UA.\n\nPlan several potential schedules before attending Bama Bound.\n\nStudents complete Alcohol Edu and Haven online.\n\nLay out an area based upon the dimensions of your chosen dorm room.  If your stuff doesn\u2019t fit, you\u2019re bringing too much.  The more stuff you bring, the more stuff you\u2019ll have to store or move out.  You don\u2019t need everything you have at home.:)\n\nCopy or scan important documents such as insurance and social security card.\n\n\nThese sites are helpful in identifying the deadlines and steps to follow throughout this process.  Note that the dates listed are for 2014-15, so be aware the dates will be slightly different for freshmen entering 2015.\n\nhttp://gobama.ua.edu/steps/freshman-checklist/\n\nhttp://gobama.ua.edu/steps/freshman/\n\nhttp://scholarships.ua.edu/faq/\n\nhttp://housing.ua.edu/new_students/freshman_residency.cfm\n\nhttp://housing.ua.edu/movein/checkin/signup.cfm\n\nhttp://housing.ua.edu/movein/checkin/schedule.cfm?CFID=7500789&CFTOKEN=51780232\n\nhttp://housing.ua.edu/movein/arrival/pack_tips.cfm\n\nhttp://housing.ua.edu/movein/arrival/policies.cfm\n\nhttp://housing.ua.edu/on_campus/com_living_standards.cfm\n\n\n\nPlease feel free to add to or edit any information provided here.

Plan and write an essay in which you develop your point of view or on this issue. Support your position with reasoning and examples taken from your reading studies experience or observations\n\n\nPeople can resist hunger thirst epidemics and even warfare, but they cannot live without a catharsis. The catharsis gives people the power to withstand against the disasters. However, while some catharses might be helpful such as sports and literature, some of them can be devastating, for example alcoholism. The adoration of celebrities is a type of catharsis relaxing people, but it is not an advantageous one, since it causes loss of money and strange situations.\nThe admiration of celebrities creates an unfair financial environment. In China an average person works for 12 hours a day and can only earn $150 according to the statistics. In contrast Lady Gaga can earn $150,000 only for one concert and Christiana Rinaldo's annual income is above $1,500,000. These celebrities might be really important for the public, but do they actually deserve every penny they earn? Is the poor Chinese laborer any less industrious than they are?\nAlong with these unjust conditions overrated interest in celebrities makes people do senseless things. Britney Spears baby's poop had been sold for $200. For the sake of the religious leader of the Scientology and his commandments thousands of people left their families and stop seeing them. There are unfortunate incidents in which a poor fan commits suicide because her/his proposal to take a sign of a famous figure was rejected. Overreaction to anything may engender bizarre results. However, in terms of the admiration of celebrities, these bizarre results are pretty perspicuous.\nLastly, the celebrities are not the only catharsis for the people. Of course mother Terissa was a great person who helped Indian people and brought peace to the region. Nevertheless, throughout the history the deed assumed by mother Theresa was executed by different numerous things. Religion arts and ideologies can be catharses as well. Buddhism had brought peace to India in ancient times, the orientalist architecture adorned the country and Gandhi saved the country with his ideology. The celebrities are only the trend catharsis for the current and era. Maybe next time it will be social media.\nAlthough the celebrities help public to extend, considering the unjust financial situation, strange events and interchangeability of the agent society, does not actually need celebrities.

I\u2019m about to embark on my umpteenth expedition into the uncharted territory of a fresh sheet of paper.  The endless expanse of the flat, empty plane stretches on for miles.  It\u2019s a frightening journey, but one which every high school student must make.\n\n\u201cYou have to use the essay to tell colleges who you are,\u201d my teacher said.  \u201cThis is your opportunity to make yourself shine.\u201d  But how could I describe myself in just 650 words?

I wrote about how many years of training and failure came to fruition when I earned my C15 rating.  What drove me to never give up was my refusal to accept anything but the best I could achieve.  However, it was this quality that led to one of my first crumpled papers.  Expressing my passion ended up being harder than executing the perfect counterattack.\n\n\u201cSports are clich\u00e9,\u201d my teacher said.  \u201cFocus on making yourself stand out.\u201d  My next essay focused on my love for music.  In a few words, I succeeded despite being told I could not do so because of my determination.  But how would this story stand out among many others just like it?  I was better at expressing my passion through the language of music.  Even a Spohr Concerto could not compare to the technical difficulty of stuffing myself into a 650 word box.  My mulish desire to write the perfect essay resulted in my artfully crafted words being stuffed violently into the crammed trash can.  The countless YouTube videos I\u2019d watched and innumerable essays I\u2019d read didn\u2019t seem to be helping.\n\n\u201cThe night before her AP Chemistry exam, she learned her father had an affair\u2026 with a 23-year-old prostitute.\u201d  \u201cThe alcohol-consuming, poor Muslim family down the street with whom no sane member of society would want interact.\u201d  Compared to the moving difficulties these students had faced, my mundane challenges seemed like they would fade into the background.\n\n\u201cThis is confidence.\u201d  The three-word-essay had me reeling for months on end.  How could I be unique without sounding gimmicky?\n\nI needed to be remarkable, and I needed to stand out amongst thousands.\n\nWhat could I do?\n\nAfter weeks of drafts and phony essays, I realized what was most important.  I had been given an opportunity to show who I was.  I needed to show case every quality, both positive and negative- my determination, stubbornness, dry humor, indecisiveness, and even my weird, unorthodox way of thinking.  It had to be me- not the \u201cperfect\u201d student, but me.  No person is complete without his imperfections- and if my essay is supposed to represent me, it shouldn\u2019t be perfect.  The perfect essay is an impossible myth- and if it ever existed, I imagine it would be quite boring.\n\nI took this lesson to heart.  This essay may be unconventional, quirky, and a little weird, but so am I.  Millions of cross-outs, sloppily written drafts, and dead trees later, here I am.  Because of my unfazed mettle, I was able to use my failures as components to build my success.   The moral of the story?  This is me.  I\u2019m weird, a little avant-garde, and definitely not perfect.  And I\u2019d take that over perfection any day.\n"}, {"date": "2015-01-21T11:57:44+00:00", "url": "http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/university-maryland-college-park/1733548-q-a-about-decisions-honors-scholars-what-to-do-when-decisions-are-posted.html", "messages": "\n                    Here are some threads - oldies but goodies - that will help answer some questions while everyone awaits D-Day...I'm hoping other veterans will jump in to post advice on this thread as well :)\n\nTo answer the question about scholars v honors, @Noogler, here is this from several years ago when I had the same question myself. I know that there have been some updates to each of the programs, of course, but the concept is primarily the same. In brief, honors is for students that tend to have a history of challenging themselves mostly with classes, scholars is for students that tend to have a history of challenging themselves a lot outside of the traditional lecture setting...? Not saying scholars don't take challenging classes and not saying honors don't challenge themselves outside of the class. More a pattern of predominance, but who knows exact deciding factors...? Honestly, not mutually exclusive. Is one better than the other? As @SoofDad said, it's all about fit.\nhttp://talk.collegeconfidential.com/university-maryland-college-park/1283252-college-park-scholars-vs-honors-college-p1.html\n\nAnd, as promised, here is my absolute favorite thread, from my all-time favorite poster, @astrophysicsmom - best advice ever!\nhttp://talk.collegeconfidential.com/university-maryland-college-park/1283751-new-admits-advice-from-mom-of-2-terps-p1.html\n\nAlso, I want to suggest starting a thread for actual decisions/results only because that one \"decisions\" thread has gotten out of hand with discussions...if that can lay dormant from now until decisions are posted, and discussions are moved here, great!

You'd think that's a good thing.  However, the problem is that many students were forced to take this class because their schools cancelled their honors physics classes (as the College Board advised them to).  So instead of the more typical progression seen with chemistry and biology (honors then AP, if you really liked the subject), you had many students taking an AP-level Physics class as their first exposure to to the subject.  The result?  A historic low percentage of students demonstrating mastery of the material (merely 4.1% got 5's) and a historic high failure rate (63.1% with 2's or 1's). The College Board has now given the false impression to many tens of thousands of US students with a demonstrated interest in science that they are not cut out for it.\n\nEven worse, those few students who were lucky enough to have teachers who were able to properly prepare them for this test have been harmed too.  In our local high school they used to offer two physics classes (Honors and Physics B).  They then replaced Honors Physics with Physics 1, promising students they would offer Physics 2 the next year.  In theory, it sounded great.  You get the same two-year progression, but with a coherent curriculum spread out between two years.  Less duplication, etc. etc.  But guess what?  Not enough students signed up for Physics 2, so they are not offering it next year.  (Some students weren't as interested in physics as other sciences, while other students -- the type that might have skipped right into Physics B in the past -- didn't feel like spending two full years studying an algebra-based physics curriculum).  As a result, the school's students are stuck with one physics class, Physics 1, which may be more in depth in some areas, but also covers fewer fundamental physics topics than the honors class alone had in the past.  I'm sure this experience is not unique.\n\nThe two-year AP Physics track also harms students in other ways.  Many students don't traditionally take an AP science class until their junior year.  Further, because high schools are cancelling their Honors Physics classes (as the College Board said to), if you want to take an advanced level physics in high school, most likely you have to take Physics 1 AP.  Moreover, because the algebra-based AP Physics track is now two years, many will be forced to take Physics 1 AP their junior year.  That may force out another AP science that would otherwise have been taken that year.  It is also difficult to take the Physics SAT subject test after Physics 1 AP because they don't really match up.  So, unless you are taking two advanced science courses during your junior year, which is difficult for many reasons, it could be very hard to get a good score on any SAT science subject test to submit.  As a result, many science and engineering applicants could be left with a hole in their college applications.\n\nSince the primary purpose of AP classes is often touted to be gaining college credit, I initially thought that the College Board's decision to obliterate the standard high school physics curriculum was to ensure that more students actually get credit.  But it looks like the EXACT OPPOSITE may be happening. Stanford has announced that, unlike for Physics B, their Physics department had determined that NO CREDIT will be given for either Physics 1 or Physics 2, no matter your test score.  I haven't checked to see whether other colleges are following suit, but Stanford's view alone is enough to cause serious concern.\n\nSo I hope Trevor Packer and his colleagues are working over time right now to figure out how to fix this fiasco.  Sadly, the damage is already done for the first generation of students already forced to take Physics 1.

So I should have easily gotten 80% FRQ.

Indeed, by choosing a good pay over work you enjoy makes you lose your sense of purpose and drive. If we look at history, we realize that full dedication to work often results in extraordinary outcomes : we'll see how Nikola Tesla was a very telling example. Finally, we'll see how artists, who choose fulfilling careers over steady jobs, are crucial to society.\n\nWhen someone chooses safety and money over passion, one kills a part of one's self : a person is at first full of dreams and expectations, but a passionate violin player settling for a career in finance sets aside his true interest. He therefore loses his sense of purpose, his drive : his work will not be motivated by desire to achieve something but by money. Thus, the worker's attention to detail will slowly disappear. Moreover, he will never reach his maximum potential happiness and he eventually will do damage, due to his negligence.\n\nOn the contrary, when one is motivated to get up every morning to work, great things are achieved : Nikola Tesla, the famous engineer, perfectly illustrates this idea. His work, spanning the second half of the 19th century and the first half of the 20th century, has brought a multitude of great inventions to the world. Completely dedicated to work, he never put more attention on money than on his work : as a result, although he could have been rich from his first inventions, he kept working.\n\nAnother example that shows the importance of choosing a fulfilling job is artists. In a society that values, for instance, engineers, lawyers and doctors more, being an artist is a difficult job : aside from a few \u201cbreakthrough\u201d artists, the celebrities you hear about in television, most artists struggle to make consistent money. However, instead of putting their passion aside, they choose it over comfortable life. This choice is crucial not only to the artist himself, but also to society, which greatly benefits from artists, as they shape the world we know today.\n\nThose three examples attest of the importance of choosing fulfilling jobs : caring too much about the money makes you forget to care about the actual job. Moreover, history shows what can happen when working is a result of motivation and passion : we witnessed the achievements of Nikola Tesla and the importance of artists. Now, one might wonder if it realistic to imagine a world where people only take on fulfilling jobs : who will be in charge of, say, the boring paperwork ? Well, the current advances in artificial intelligence may delete a lot of repetitive jobs, leaving people to look for something unique to do, something they, hopefully, enjoy.\n\n\nThank you !\n"}, {"date": "2015-06-07T16:27:04+00:00", "url": "http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/foreign-medical-education/1782937-uk-medical-schools-undergrad-chances-usa-applicant.html", "messages": "\n                    Hi CC!\n\n(I would like to apologise in advance if I appear cocky and trying to \"show off.\" I try my best to be modest, but as some people have said in the forums, it is \"American Culture\" to be braggy, even if it is unintentional. Sorry! I just want to provide you guys with the most information I can give you, so that you can have a clearer image of my qualifications or standing.)\n\nI've been lurking on this site for quite some time now, but I haven't found the answer to some of my questions. I've read through about a 100 pages of replies and researched the university sites themselves. Still I have questions that remain unanswered.\n\nMy question is basically, do I have a shot at these schools? I know you have to take the BMAT and UKCAT for some of these schools, and that all of them are extremely competitive. The medical schools I am looking into are:\n\nImperial College London\nUniversity College London|\nKing's College\nBart's School of Medicine\nUniversity of Bristol\nUniversity of Edinburgh\nUniversity of Manchester\nUniversity of Oxford\n\nI would like to say I have read up on the basic rules of the UCAS system;I am aware I can only apply to 4 medical schools via the UCAS system. So as of now, my top picks (that I believe I have a potential at getting into) would be:\n\nImperial College London\nUniversity College London\nUniversity Manchester\nUniversity of Edinburgh or University of Bristol\n______________________________________________________________\n\nFirstly I will list my relevant qualifications:\n\nRising Senior at a High School on Long Island, NY\n\nAP Scores:\n\nAP Biology - 5\nAP Chemistry - 5\nAP Physics (1 and 2; two separate test) (Predicted) - 4 or 5\n\nSAT II Scores:\n\nBiology - 780\nChemistry - 800\nPhysics - 710 (will retake)\n\nSAT (First try, results from June test will come out in 3 weeks; I expect to superscore and have a much higher grade):\n\nNet: 2040\nReading: 710\nMath: 650\nWriting: 680\n__________________________________________________________\nAP taking next year:\n\nCalculus BC\nPhysics C (Both Tests)\nStatistics\nPsychology\nLiterature\nU.S Government\n\nIndependent Study: (These are actually taught by school staff, I won't be learning them on my own)\n\nMulti-Variable Calculus (One step above BC Calc, One step behind Linear Algebra\n_______________________________________________________________________\n\n\nExtracurricular Activities:\n\n1. Independent Research at University: Last summer I did research on the neuronal membrane protein, Nuregulin-1 Type 3, and see if the intracellular domain of the protein influences apoptotic factors in the cell. This summer I will be working on an independent research project dealing with Sepsis. ( Research last summer at Stony Brook University, Research this summer will be at the Feinstien Institute of Medical Research, apart of the North Shore LIJ health care system).\n\n2. Hospital Volunteer: Over the summer I will be volunteering at a hospital, doing both clerical and patient care tasks. Unfortunately, I won't actually have any \"clinical\" experience as the hospital does not offer shadowing doctors. It is also quite a uncommon thing to do in my area and the NYC area.\n\n***Volunteering related to kids, because I want to do Surgery, specifically pediatrics***\n1. Chinese School Teacher's Assistant: I'v been doing this for about 4 years now. Working with kids.\n\n2.

Back in April, I met with one of the international student-recruiters from Oxford University in NYC and asked her about my credentials, and she said that it was what Oxford was looking for. She also told me that only 1% of international applicants actually make it, so that kind of deters my decision from applying to Oxford. She said it wasn't that students weren't qualified, it was that there was just so many applicants, Oxford can't take everyone.\n\nSo! Please help me in anyway you can!

Thus, I reached the conclusion that I should try and ask you guys about my case.\n\nI always wanted to study at an US university. At first, I was thinking/dreaming about Harvard/MIT/Princeton etc. However, after I took the SAT for the first time, I was disappointed. Even though my dream school is Stanford, I'm really afraid that I won't have any real chances due to my SAT Scores. On top of that, the fact that I require full fledged financial aid may also represent a deal-breaker.\n\nSo, in a nutshell, I'm a future high school senior from Romania and I want to know whether I have any real chances at Stanford, the Ivies (Harvard, UPenn, Amherst, Princeton etc), Caltech, the UCs as well as schools that offer full scholarships. (I'm also thinking about NYU Abu Dhabi)\n\n\nAcademic Results:\n\nhigh school average (for the first 3 years) 9.75 / 10\n\nGPA:  3.9      =       9.75 x 4 /10 (I don't think that this is entirely correct since a 5 hours per week Math Class weighs the same as a one hour per week History Class in our system)\n\nRank: the 2nd in my classroom (30 people) and in the top 5% in my high school.\n\nOur high school is one of the best ranking in Romania and my profile of study is called Mathematics- Computer Science(that's what it emphasizes) We also have an intensive English programme (more than any other high school in Romania) + extra classes about the geography, politics, culture etc of the US and UK.\n\nSAT: 2110 (CR 740, M 700 :( , W 670 E 8 )\n\nSAT Physics 710 :(\n\nSAT Math II 750 :(\n\nSAT World History 600 (Didn't actually study for it, I was just curios so I decided to take it on that day)\n---\nExtracurriculars: (i'm trying to be as concise as possible so you actually read them)\n\nAn issue would be that I lack prizes in academic competitions such as olympiads and etc and I'm more of a well-rounded (or spread out) student. To be honest, I wouldn't like being otherwise, but I heard that some unis prefer more lopsided students.\n\nAcademic: Won a few \"Mentions\" at the local stage of the Physics, Computer Science and ITC Olympiads.\n\nOther ECs:\n\n(No particular order, maybe you can help me select the best ones for the Common App)\n\nI'm including almost all of them so you can get a better sense of who I am.\n\n1. Benjamin Franklin Transatlantic Fellow 2014 at Purdue University\n\n- Department of State programme, fully funded, one month in the US. It was mostly about International Relations, Project Development, Law studies etc.) I was the only one chosen from a pool of 300 Romanian applicants. Won a 500$ grant during the programme's project competition to start two EC Clubs.(below)\n\n2. Founded The Humanities Club and The Science Club in my high school. I'm not going to go into details, but things are going pretty well and we are planning to hold a public speaking competition and a science fair for the high school students from Bucharest. We're also inviting different high-profile people to speak at events in our high school.(2014-today)\n\n3. Founder of a website/startup called Voievozii.ro. Got a 1000$ grant in a project competition from Youth Bank to promote Romanian entrepreneurs and inventors. Held a small science fair at our high school with the aforementioned inventors and the whole school attended. The media also talked about our event. (2012-today) I've learnt a lot about programming, graphic design, video filming and editing, organizing events etc etc etc. Voievozii basically taught me almost everything about starting a project.\n\n4. Founding member of a Coalition for the Development of Education that aims to completely transform the Romanian Educational System by uniting all the education-related organizations in Romania. This coalition will first bring the orgs and high-ranking officials from the govt in a structured dialogue and afterwards work on tangible reforms.\n\n5. Released a few Android and IOS games. (2014 -today) (I programmed and designed the graphics)\n\n6. I was invited to author an essay that was published in a book called Romania's New Wave. I wrote about changing Romania's educational system, the impact of tech on our generation, broader geopolitical aspects such as Romania's place in the European Union etc. The book includes essays from entrepreneurs, inventors, former ministers, activists and leaders of the Romanian society. The book is under the Foreign Policy brand and adopts a crowdfunding model that allows it to be shared as much as possible. The book's coordinators also invited me to participate in a talk show on a major Romanian news channel.\n\n7. Chief Designer/Project Manager at Open Vote (2014-present)\n\nI helped design and produce an app that allowed Romanian citizens, home and abroad, to report voting fraud with the help of pictures and geo location during the 2014 Romanian presidential election. There were many reports of bribery, vote tourism, mismanagement of the voting stations etc. The biggest issue that Open Vote helped uncover was that of Ro Embassies abroad which, under the guidance of the Prime Minister that was also a candidate, limited the number of Romanians who could vote because the diaspora was not favorable to him. Open Vote also represented a bad experience due to the quality of the product in the end, but that is another story. We have also received and AD grant from Google and lots of media coverage.\n\n8. Youngest participant at the Young Leaders for Tomorrow's Europe Conference in Bratislava, Slovakia (2014)\n\n-I was chosen as a participant after going through an application process that admitted only 20 participants out of 400 applicants. Full expenses paid by the organizers. The focus was on international relations.\n\n9. I won the 3rd prize in a nation wide poster design contest organized by the US Embassy in Bucharest. My poster was displayed at the Embassy, American Corner etc\n\n(a few online courses from Coursera)\n10. Learn to Program: The Fundamentals from the University of Toronto (this taught me all the basics)\n\n11. Gamification from UPENN (I loved this course due to Kevin Werbach, a great professor at Wharton)\n\n12. What's your big idea? from The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (amazing intro to entrepreneurship + the lean startup)\n\n13. Journalism course \u201cHow much freedom do you have on the internet? \u2013 Digital rights and wrongs\u201d by CJI (September 2012)\n\n14. Participated in the Mini Model United Nations that took place at Cosbuc as the delegate for the Russian Federation (April 2014)  Won the best delegate award.\n\n15. Participated at the Global Enterprise Project \u2013 National Challenge by Junior Achievement \u2013 Young Enterprise Romania  (March 2014)\n\n16. Participated (didn't finish because I didn't like what was happening there at all) in the Center for Excellence in Physics after passing a difficult admission exam. (2013)\n\n17. Designed the poster and graphics for the 2014 Freshman Ball ( 3000 attendants) and helped organize the 2012 freshman ball.\n\nFuture projects\n\n18. I was invited to speak at a TEDx conference\n\n19. I will launch a new kind of online retail store this summer\n\n20. A crowdfunding campaign for a board game.\n\nAs you can see, I'm a bit too spread out. I love programming, designing, working on projects and I think that's my main disadvantage because admission officers might not see that I actually love trying and doing a lot of stuff in my free time. I just think that because there are so many things on this planet, it would be shame not to try them and ultimately, create something truly meaningful with the acquired knowledge.\n\nThanks in advance!

However, I don't think I qualify for the Pell Grant since my sibling (a rising junior in a college that meets full financial need) has never received any $ from the Pell Grant. In my impression, Pell Grant is for the most needy students. Our family income is in the range of $70,000-80,000. Could I make any mistake in the NPC? What amount should I put for the tax my parents paid? Their tax should be about $5,000. With some tax credit, they actually paid about $1,500. Should I enter $5,000 instead of $1,500? Otherwise I don't think I make any mistake in the NPC questions.\n\nI also notice that most of the schools (meeting full financial need) give me the same FA, disregarding my sibling is in college or not. This is different from the results I got when I tried the NPCs in January.I know the College Board NPC has been updated by many colleges recently. Each school I did twice, with a sibling in college and without. How come that many schools don't distinguish the two situations? I'm pretty puzzled. My counselor told me the EFC would be reduced to 50% when my sibling is also in college. However, I only see about $1,000-2,000 difference or no difference at all.\n\nBTW, my sibling goes to a college that claims its NPC is very reliable and it is (from my sibling's experience). It gives me an estimate of FA without Pell Grant and the net cost is about 60% of my sibling's plus $2,000 student contribution. However, our family isn't sure if this college would be willing to give two huge financial aid packages to our family if I am admitted. (I have similar stats of my sibling.) This college meets 100% financial need of admitted students and admits that it is need-aware toward the bottom 10-20% of the students qualified for admission. I am not sure how strong an applicant I am in its pool.\n\nAny insight, advice, or experience on NPC and colleges meeting full need is highly appreciated.

I would really appreciate it if someone graded this essay! Some questions about my essay:\n\n1. Did I oversimplify it?\n2. Is it too long?\n3. Were my two examples specific and effective enough?\n\nThank you!\n\n\n*My previous, not-so-improved essay is on the bottom.\n\nTOPIC\n\"A man should never be ashamed to own he has been in the wrong, which is but saying, in other words, that he is wiser today than he was yesterday.\u0094\nAlexander Pope\n\nAssignment:\nDo we learn more from finding out that we have made mistakes or from our successful actions? Plan and write an essay...\n\n\nIMPROVED ESSAY\nDo we learn more from finding out that we have made mistakes or from our successful actions? Failure and success are two paths that lead to the same destination. In failure, one can learn from mistakes to be successful next time, whereas in success, one knows what to do to achiever other successes. For example, Douglass MacArthur strategic mistakes lead to America\u0092s victory in the Korean War, while the repeated and successful use of guerrilla warfare caused North Vietnam to win the Vietnam War. Therefore, people learn from both winning and losing equally because learning from one failure can lead to another success and because success gives you a model to follow.\n\nTo begin with, learning from ways you have failed helps you to set the stage for success. For example, the Korean War and Douglass MacArthur were both a failure and a success. MacArthur, commander of the American forces, was sent to Korea when North Korea had almost completely taken over South Korea. Being the great strategist he was, MacArthur took back all of South Korea. His only mistake was to push further in North Korea. When he reached China\u0092s border, China reinforced North Korea. This resulted in devastating losses in the U.S. Army and much of South Korea taken by the North again. MacArthur paid for his mistakes, and he was removed from his post as a commander. However, America learned from his mistake and refused to aggravate North Korea and China by pushing back the border yet again. In the end, both countries settled for a completely free South Korea and a completely Communist North Korea. Learning from the mistakes of Douglass MacArthur set America for success and turned around the Korean War.\n\nFurthermore, one success shows you how to achieve the same thing over and over again. For example, guerrilla warfare was used in the Vietnam War by North Vietnam repeatedly. North Vietnam soldiers had the advantage of knowing the dense jungle terrain and using it to gain the upper hand. These soldiers used Guerrilla Warfare, a method of concealing an army under the jungle, with successful results. These quick ambushes could accomplish several things at once: kill enemy soldiers, destroy ammunition, and blow up combat vehicles. To North Vietnam, these were all huge successes. Historians agree that by repeatedly using Guerrilla Warfare, North Vietnam greatly shortened the war while America suffered huge losses. One success, like using Guerrilla Warfare in one battle, can show you how to achieve even more success, like all the other battles that North Vietnam won using Guerrilla Warfare.\n\nFailure and success are really two same things, except that one has a reward and a different name. Despite this, you learn the same amount and experience the same thing each way. First of all, learning from the mistakes of MacArthur in the Korean War, America succeeded in winning it. Second, using Guerrilla Warfare once and see how successful it was, North Vietnam used it repeatedly to win the Vietnam War. Some say losers are winners while others say winning is everything. In reality, losers and winners gain the same experience, knowledge, and insight, and, in the end, that\u0092s what matters most.\n\n\nUNIMPROVED ESSAY\nWinning or reaching a goal is what everybody strives for. However, we sometimes lose or fail to achieve what we want. Many people say that losing gives you the chance to learn from your mistakes, but others say that winning sets an example. What is the real truth? People learn from both winning and losing equally because learning from one failure can lead to another success and because success gives you a model to follow.\n\nTo begin with, learning from ways you have failed helps you to set the stage for success. For example, the Korean War and Douglass MacArthur were both a failure and a success. MacArthur, commander of the American forces, was sent to Korea when North Korea had almost completely taken over South Korea. Being the great strategist he was, MacArthur took back all of South Korea. His only mistake was to push further in North Korea. When he reached China\u0092s border, China reinforced North Korea. MacArthur was removed from his post, but America learned from his mistake and refused to aggravate North Korea and China by pushing back the border. Learning from mistakes can turn one failure into another success.\n\nFurthermore, one success shows you how to achieve the same thing over and over again. For example, getting a six on a SAT essay is no simple thing. However, once I got a six on one of my practice essays, I repeated this over and over again. My score was also repeated over and over again. I had learned the structure of a good essay, not just for SAT, but also for college and jobs. My successes just once lead to multiple other successes. Winning and being successful can show you the right way to do so, resulting in much more winning and success!\n\nFailure and success are really two same things, except that one has a reward and a different name. Despite this, you learn the same amount and experience the same thing each way. First of all, learning from the mistakes of MacArthur in the Korean War, America succeeded in winning it. Second, by using a structure from one of my best essays, I got good scores the other times I wrote an essay. Some say losers are winners while others say winning is everything. In reality, losers and winners gain the same experience, knowledge, and insight, and, in the end, that\u0092s what matters most.

Primarily the fact that the test results are more correlated to income than they are to college grades. Res ipsa locquitur; colleges should not be using the SAT as a component of the college admissions assessment.\n\nWhile I agree that this fact is troubling, the people who are complaining are attacking the messenger. The K-12 education process in the US results in students in wealthier districts obtaining a better education. Everyone knows that. There are many causes, but in the end, on average, they just know more. So why ignore that problem, and then complain about the test at the end of the process that points it out?\n\nFurthermore, the fact that SAT scores do not do a good job of predicting college grades is well understood. Appropriately, students tend to pick colleges, college majors, and courses that they believe they can succeed in. Students with low/modest scores are more likely to attend less selective colleges, and/or choose majors with lower levels of rigor. Students with Top scores are more likely to go to a highly selective college and/or major in something more rigorous such as science or engineering. The low scoring student and the high scoring student end up with a similar GPA, but it is very unlikely that a student with a 1400 SAT score could possibly succeed in the same Linear Algebra class that a student with a 2250 SAT score might be taking. The test successfully distinguished these two students level of knowledge.\n\nI agree that revisions to make the SAT more relevant are good, but I suspect that the results will be the same. Higher income students will, on average, continue to out learn and out score low income students. The results will not change because that is what is actually happening.\n\nWe need to fix the actual problem, not shoot the messenger. Unfortunately, actually fixing the problem is hard, so we try to hide this turd under the rug by distracting everyone and complaining about the test.\n"}, {"date": "2015-02-28T10:01:20+00:00", "url": "http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/what-my-chances/1746720-transfer-chance-me-for-ivy-league.html", "messages": "\n                    Hello Everyone and thank you for your time to read this,\nI am a white male and am currently an, enrolled freshmen in his spring semester at City College of San Francisco. I am a political science major hoping to pursue politics one day, determined and hopeful attend an ivy league one day and be amongst the greats.\n\nPerhaps I should start with my background: Please note beforehand, my life is not meant to be a sob story nor is it meant to portray sympathy but instead show the difficulties I overcame in the past and why my high school marks are the way they are. I grew up in a hood of a small town called Lompoc, California where I attended Cabrillo High School. I was active on the water polo team, mock trial, medical interest club, and red cross clubs. My mom ran off when I was young. My dad was unemployed and a severe drunk. When I say drunk that is no doubt an understatement. He has severe addiction to many other recreational drugs and was constantly in a rage which lead to multiple CPS calls, constant fist fights, many police incidents (nothing on my record), and a severe depression on my part. I spent a good majority of the high school years trying to connect with people similar to my situation, which only got me to worse situations in my life. I got caught up in the wrong crowd and started missing lots of school, by my junior year, and although I somehow qualified for a couple AP classes, nothing was phenomenal. Short story, I was a complete mess which unfortunately took me down the route of gang life. At the time, the gangsters were open, welcoming, and gave me a sense of family. I lacked incentive to do anything with my life. In the beginning of my spring semester of my senior year of high school, literally the minute I turned eighteen, my father kicked out of my household. This was b.c. his sixth wife (divorced by the other five) did not like me and persuaded my dad to remove me. I became homeless and my living situation varied from homeless shelter to friend's couches to the streets. By then I dealt with substance addiction to multiple drugs, missed most school, dealt with major depression/anger issues, and got by by breaking into cars, stealing their contents and selling them (somehow the police never caught me). Yes I was a terrible individual who was entirely self centered, a complete juvenile, and I should be punished for everything I've done. However in early May, the principal called me in. She sat me down and had a one-on-one conversation with me about my life, where I was going, and fixed me somehow to this day I cannot explain what quite did it. I told her I wanted to change and I didn't know where to even begin. She offered me therapy if I would actually start attending class and I gladly obliged. A distant friend from an middle-upper-class family, offered to take me in. His family were strong Christians and for some reason taken pity on me and saw something in me I never saw. They became my new parents for those last months before graduation. I dealt with substantial withdrawals and tried to avoid anybody from my old life, especially the gangbangers downtown that seemed to always be looking for me. Somehow I actually had barely a good enough attendance to graduate. I graduated with a 2.8 GPA with an SAT score of 1540. A different friend of mine was moving to Pacifica after graduation to attend City College of San Francisco (to Pacifica because rent is cheaper) because it had a good transfer program and needed a roommate. Most kids in Lompoc, if they even went to college usually went to Allan Hancock, but I knew if I was going to survive by permanently disappearing from the gangsters and was to actually chase greatness I had to leave, so here I am now. I acquired a job in SF because of the high minimum wage, but I have to work at least 40 hours to get by. In my fall semester two of my closest friends passed away which put me back in a severe depression plus I was not very smart to begin which lead to the finished fall semester with a 3.3 GPA. I do not talk to either of my parents and am entirely alone nowadays. I do not think ivy leagues colleges ask nor care about the past, only the results which is a set back for me. This current semester has been the first of my recovery and I am finally showing positive results for once and I intend to keep things this way, I will not give up. I am showing progress\n\nH.S.\nClubs: Medical Interest, Mock Trial, Red Cross\nTeam: Water Polo and Swim Team\nGPA: 2.8\nSAT: 1540/2400\n\nCity College of San Francisco (spring semester)\nMajor:Political Science\nCURRENLTY OFFICER IN: Political Science and Economics Club,alpha gamma sigma (honors society),alpha gamma beta(business honors society)\nCommunity Service:earned more than 100 hours this semester in miscellaneous soup kitchens\nNon-Profit: VP of Island-Aid non-profit, which sends food and relief to starving families in Philippines\nWork:40 hours minimum as busboy in restaurant b.c.I need the money to pay my bills\nGPA:3.96 (3.3 fall semester, I since then have multiple tutors and I currently have a 4.0 if I continue at the same rate I am going.I calculate it at that b.c. 3.96 that is what I will have when I graduate)\nEC: in honors society, have a membership at the World Affairs Council and watch speeches from renowned individuals whenever I have the spare time\nCredits: 12/semester, no more because of work, which means I will spend three more semesters after this current one to graduate from CCSF\nPlanned: looking for a summer internship with a politician/ internship with world affairs council, was looking to join student council but the head of the honors society/my political science professor discouraged it because the student council is \"futile and powerless\" and if I want to become a politician I should run for some miscellaneous position in the city government and get experience campaigning, hope by my fall semester to start campaigning and start with experience in politics\n\nI know many of you will see me as a juvenile delinquent and a loser but I want you to see that I am better than that.

My professors and counselors  tell me that there is an extremely high chance I will get accepted to UC Berkeley if I keep working as hard as I currently am and I will regardless make the requirements to transfer to UCLA and get in even on the slight chance I don't make UC Berkeley. So I must ask, although I will apply to UC Berkeley regardless, should I just apply to UC Berkeley and the other UCs alone and attempt to transfer to an ivy league for a graduate program and not even attempt to apply to the ivy league?\n\nI have many other questions as well:\n1) I understand Ivy Leagues want an SAT score, do I have to send my h.s. SAT score or can I retake it now that I'm in college? If so when is the latest b.c. I would start finding a tutor ASAP\n2) When is the deadline to apply to colleges as I will not be able to graduate till my spring semester of next year?\n3) What else can I do to get involved and increase my chances?\n4) How much does h.s. GPA matter?\n5) Is there anymore advice you can give me?\n\nThank you all for your time for reading such a lengthy question :)\n\n"}, {"date": "2015-04-14T20:40:28+00:00", "url": "http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/college-admissions/1766292-international-olevel-transcripts-feasibility-importance-aiming-for-ivies-harvard.html", "messages": "\n                    Hello everyone!

Thinking is, of course, crucial to education, and several studies have investigated the link between type and the sort of student you are. Therefore, it seems to be a particularly helpful instrument for gauging the environment and communities at places of higher education. I have personally found it helpful in quantifying that ephemeral quality of universities and colleges: \"fit.\" Many \"gut instincts\" and reputations of colleges seem to have a significant foundation in these Myers Briggs analyses, adding some validity to the approach.\n\nMethods:\n1. Information is collected via admitted student facebook group post asking people to comment with their Myers Briggs type. Exact wording has not been consistent. Sometimes a link is included for people to take an online test.\n2. At least 75 participants must respond before data can be recorded\n3. If a person is unsure and is between two types, they will be recorded as 1/2 in each type\n4. If a person is unsure and is between more than two types, their response will not be recorded\n\nLimitations of study:\n1. Self-reporting type is inherently flawed, because people may project themselves as the type they want to be rather than one they actually are and/or might have used unofficial online tests to attain results and/or may not have thoroughly verified the results for themselves through self-reflection.\n2. The flaws of self-reporting are exaggerated in the context of a Facebook post because some types might be more likely to have a Facebook, respond to a post, respond if they see others of their same type responding and/or respond if they don't see others of their same type responding.\n3. The sample size is very small, covering approximately or less than 5% of admitted students in most cases.\n4. I am not a psychologist, so all of my conclusions about how types are likely to act are based on informal reading and observation.\n\nUse of study:\n1. For the above reasons, the study CANNOT be used in an absolute context. For example, if 60% of respondents are thinkers, that suggests but does not necessarily mean that there are more thinkers than feelers in the overall body of admitted students, let alone that the exact percentage is 60%.\n2. Since methods between universities were the same, the study CAN be used in a comparative context. That is, the fact that 60% responded as introverts at one university and 40% responded as introverts at another university suggests that the first university has significantly more introverts, whatever the actual percentage of introverts is.\n3. The study CAN be used to gauge whether you are similar to some students at particular university, because at the very least you know there are people of your type or with similar preferences at the university.\n4. The study CANNOT be used to determine that you are NOT similar to students at the university, because the sample size is far too small to show whether your type or preferences are common, let alone whether they exist at all. Also, it is highly statistically probable that every university admits students of every type, even if not in equal numbers.\n5. The study is BEST used with a firm grasp of the theory and limitations of Myers Briggs typology itself, including the meaning of the individual preferences (I/E, S/N, F/T, P/J) AND how these preferences interact to form type.\n\nResults: posted in comments because this post is too long.

Just months away from the AS examination, and already enrolled and being taught A2 subjects(though not paid/registered), I found out I could have applied straight out of public high school(Yeah, I'm international). Furthermore, I was told that my progress for the year amounted to nothing, and I'd blown a pretty penny and sleepless nights on zilch.\n\nThe question now of course, is whether the past year can be salvaged. Should I apply with my AS mock/final results and skip out on A2? Is there a benefit to complete my A2 examination? How will my GPA be measured? Based on the final result or an accumalation of all my term results? Will my public high school results add to my GPA? I've heard that having A2 qualifications can get me credits or something.\n\nAn then theres the situation in which I'm not exactly close to being a bright student. 1780 on my SAT, a GPA thats likely to be around 2.7-3.0(could be less), and ECs to cry for. If my final result is significantly better than my usual grade, will I be able to undo the damage? Can I still make up for the lack of ECs in the next 6 months? I've heard application letters can change everything, but will it help my case? I'm actually only aiming for undergraduate state colleges, but my near lack of EC's means that I literally have no \"safe schools\". Heck, I don't even know how they review ECs.\n\nIf it helps, I'm currently taking Math, Biology, Chemistry, Physics, and Thinking Skills for both AS and A2. Teethering around the C mark for pretty much all of them, though I'm confident I can get atleast 3 aces if I get my things straight.

I just want some parental advice, or just advice from adults? I apologize but I'm a bit weird at the moment.\n\nRecently, I did a test at my college and talked about the results to the school counselor. I don't want to talk about specific things about my school because it's a bit small, and probably everybody knows everybody. The results said that I had severe depression, have problems socializing and expressing myself, and was prone to impulsive behavior. Of course I needed to talk to my counselor about it, but I hated talking to him because he was overly patronizing and the whole conversation seemed to be about how I needed some kind of treatment.\n\nI know now that I have depression. I knew before that something was wrong with me, but I guess I didn't know it was depression. I started college this Spring semester because of family issues. This is the first time I'm living at a dorm. I don't know from where I messed up. I got into a university with merit aid (full tuition without living expenses and dorm). My parents were happy about that, because we aren't that financially stable. I got to know a few people here and there, they weren't that bad, and I thought I was okay. But suddenly, one of the kids started ignoring me and I'm now alone. I had the phase where I couldn't understand why the kid was ignoring me, then I gave up because I tried hanging out together but that didn't work, and then I didn't want to be friends with anybody because I didn't want to go through that phase again. I don't mind being alone I guess, because I'm okay doing homework and studying and eating alone. It's not fantastic, but it's better than getting bullied. Sometimes I cry about nothing, trivial things like I can't remember things, can't solve a problem, keep seeing errors on my code, I just can't have the confidence to go ask a professor and stuff. I just cried because I couldn't remember the password to CollegeConfidential and I couldn't find the email because I forgot the email, I just remember my nickname. I feel so horrible. I really have trouble remembering things, and sometimes I oversleep because I forget there are classes. I try writing things on my hand and having notebooks, but sometimes I'm so panicked that I forgot something that I forget I have a back-up plan. Then I'm so messed up that the whole day is horrible. I'm just barely passing all my classes. I study, I really do, but I don't know. Maybe depression's just an excuse and I'm having problems controlling my behavior but I don't know from where I've messed up and where I need to fix everything. It's like a vicious cycle. I try to study, but I can't really focus, I know that I have to study, so I'm super stressed about it, I copy the textbook and notes and stuff, and I just can't take anything anymore, so I just go to sleep. Then I take the quizzes and exams, fail them or barely pass them, get sadder and hopeless, completely hate myself for not trying that hard, then I try to study again. But time's just ticking by, and the ticking sound gets on my nerves. At the same time, I have good days. I can actually focus and I'm actually learning things, but something really small ruins my whole day. Then it's just me at a corner of my dorm, trying to feel better but feeling horrible that I let a small thing ruin my day.\n\nI can't even tell my parents because my younger sibling is having trouble at school, and apparently he has to talk to a counselor too. My mom is so depressed about it, so I don't want her to get more depressed because of me. We probably can't afford a doctor. I don't want to talk to the school counselor, and I think he's the only one at the school, but he's horrible. He was like \"Of course you're not like that.\" Okay, I know I'm messed up at the moment, but I don't think he had the right to talk about me like that. Or maybe I deserved to? I don't know... But I really don't want to talk to him again. I want to get better academically and emotionally. I don't want to use depression as an excuse. I got into this college with merit aid, I must have been pretty good at high school. So why am I so messed up right now? What can I do to make things better? I try but then I fail, then I try again, then fail again. I feel worse every single time. Should I talk with an academic counselor? Should I talk with the professors? I don't want to talk about my personal issues because I think they will just sound like excuses. I'm sorry this has gotten so long, but I just want to get better but I don't know where to start. My life's falling apart, and I'm just standing here letting the clock tick by. Could you give me some advice? Any kind of advice???

However, it cannot be used for studying because it consists only of practice tests.\n\nAll tests in general:\n\n- The Official Study Guide for all SAT Subject Tests by the College Board (A, H)\nGreat practice tests for all the exams. However, there is nothing more in the book except practice tests (one per subject)\nLEGEND\n\nA - Accurate practice tests.\nB - Good for learning material you don't know.\nC - Easy to read and understand.\nD - Not a lot of superfluous material.\nE - Teacher recommendation.\nF - Slightly harder than the real thing. (Write F+ if it's a lot harder than the real thing)\nG - Good practice questions (outside of the practice tests)\nH - A lot of practice tests (more than 4)\n\nEnglish Literature:\n\n- Kaplan (C, F, G, H)\nThe review sections are generally superfluous (unless you need a review of literary terms), but the practice tests are great, though they are slightly more difficult than the actual test in that they use more esoteric words (hey, better overprepared than under, right?). For best results, you may want to use it with the Princeton Review book (see below).\nReviewer\u2019s score: 780.\n\n- Princeton Review (A, C, G)\nI felt that their practice tests were more similar to the actual test than Kaplan's, though their review sections are similarly redundant. Quantity, however, seems to matter over quality, so if you must choose either PR or Kaplan, I would go with Kaplan.\nReviewer\u2019s score: 780.\n\n- Barron\u2019s (B, C, F, G, H)\nVery comprehensive and complete. It contains everything you could possibly look for in a prep book, including excellent explanations and practice questions. Goes above and beyond the necessary material (it even contains an essay-writing section).\n\nU.S. History:\n\n- Sparknotes Review Book with 3 Online Tests (A,C,D)\nGreat for last week review and refresh.\nRecommender's score: 790.\n\n- Princeton Review (AP) (G)\nGreat prep for the SAT II (some identical questions!)\n\n- Kaplan (A, B, C, D, E, F, G)\nRecommender 1: Read it cover to cover a week before the exam and felt really prepared. It really helps for stuff you didn't cover in class.\nRecommender 1's score: 790.\nRecommender 2: I wasn't in APUSH, and my class started with Civil War onward, so I had not learned a good 30% of what was on the test. I read Kaplan cover to cover and did 2 or 3 of the practice tests. The tests were slightly harder but left me extremely prepared. The chapters were concise and great for only teaching you what you need to know.\nRecommender 2's score: 790\n\n- AMSCO (AP) (B, C, E)\nIt is the most conversational textbook-ish thing I've ever read. Amazing at reviewing material. The practice tests are helpful for review, even though they are AP practice tests. Note: The recommender for this book is the same as the one for the Barron's book.\nRecommender's score: 800.\n\n- Barron's (F+, H)\nThis book is MUCH harder than the real thing, and the recommender got 30-40 mistakes on each practice test despite getting an 800 for the actual test. Use if if you want to be very well prepared, but do not fret over a bad score, because it is highly inaccurate. Note: The recommender for this book is the same as the one for the AMSCO book.\nRecommender's score: 800.\nditto above. on average 40-45 mistakes despite scoring high on the actual test. There is no scale for the tests, but there was a lot of overlap on the may exam.\nRecommender\u2019s score: 770\n\nWorld History:\n\n- Princeton Review (A, B, C, G)\nThis book is awesome because it covers everything in a comprehensive, easy to read, and cohesive review.\nRecommender's score: 800.\n\n- Barron\u2019s (AP) ( B, C)\nIf you're taking AP, just get this book and use it to study for AP and SAT II. It's VERY detailed, so start studying at least a month in advance. Very comprehensive, excellent text.\n\nMathematics Level 1:\n\n- Princeton Review (C, D, E )\nCovers everything for this test, and is easy to read.\n\nMathematics Level 2:\n\n- Barron's (E, F+) Rec 2: (F+, H)\nAlmost everyone uses it and my teacher recommends it, even though it's COMPLETELY unrealistic (because it's a lot harder). But, because it's so much harder, it prepares you wonderfully, and the real thing is a breeze.\nRecommender 2's comment: Very much harder than the real thing, but with 8 practice tests.\nRecommender 2's score: 800.\nRecommender 3's comment: Ignore the diagnostic test, it's crazy. As for the 8 practices tests, I think they're really good(althoug harder than the real thing) if you want to get an 800 for sure.\nRecommender 3's score: 800\n\n- SAT II Math for Dummies (A, B, C, D)\nI'm a good math student so I didn't feel the need to review much or research the best book. This book helped clear up a few miscellaneous topics (probability, sets, unions, etc.) that showed up on the real test.\n\n- McGraw Hill (A, H)\nI didn't use the McGraw Hill for studying. I used Barron's for all my studying...McGraw Hill for practice tests because i finished all the practice tests in Barron's. Tests are pretty accurate. I usually skipped two or less but on the real test I skipped 3.\nRecommender\u2019s score: 800.\n\nBiology E:\n\n- Princeton Review (A, B, C, D)\nTwo of my friends used this book and said it was great. Both got 800s.\n\n- Barron\u2019s (C, D, E, F+)\nThe fact that it was so hard, scared me, but made the real test seem like a walk in the park.\nRecommender\u2019s score: 800\n\nI quote, \u201cI studied this book for like a day and I got an 800. The Barron\u2019s book is so hard, but it made the test so much easier. I wanna go take a real test to prove to myself that I know Bio.\u201d\nRecommender\u2019s score: 800\nnote: the recommender actually spent around 10 days carrying around the Barron\u2019s book and studying in various nooks and crannies. Not to mention the hours she must have spent studying at home.\n\nBiology M:\n\n- Princeton Review (A, C, D) Rec 2: (B, C, D, F, G) Rec 3: (A, B, C, D)\nTwo of my friends used this book and said it was great. Both got 800s.\nnote: all PR editions are identical from 2006-2010. (don\u2019t worry I checked.)\n\n-Sparknotes (well organized. none of the other letters apply)\nIt was well organized by topic which was nice. Some errors included, but you\u2019re on your own for that one. Would not recommend.\nRecommender\u2019s score: (730, 760)\n\nChemistry:\n\n- Barron's (B, E) Rec 2: (A, C) Rec 3: (B, F, G)\n1: The practice tests are nothing like the real thing, but the book is still a good review of EVERYTHING in high school chem.\n2: Some extra information, but not too much.\nRecommender's score: 800.\n3: There was some unnecessary information, but it's fairly well done. I did a few practice tests and skimmed the topics that were confusing or unfamiliar to me. For me, the T/T/CE section was the hardest, but this book had questions that prepared me for the test very well.\nRecommender\u2019s score: 790.\nRecommender\u2019s score: 770\n\n- Princeton Review (A, B, G) Rec 2: (B, C)\nRecommender's score: 770.\nRecommender 2's comment: Lacks some information, and is extremely brief and easy. However, it's good to use to learn material you don't know. The third practice test contains a lot of material that was not covered by the book, and is thus very difficult. This book isn't enough for someone who wants to get an 800.\nRecommender 2's score: 760.\n\nKaplan (A, B, C, D, F, G)\nThe Kaplan books seem to get a bit of a bad rap, and I'm not entirely sure why. I did 3 Kaplan tests, read through a few chapters, and no other studying, and I was really prepared.\nRecommender's Score: 780\n\nPhysics:\n\n- Barron's (A, B, C, D)\nPractice tests were somewhat different from the actual, but in general still good preparation. Little superfluous material, however preparation in some parts is on the scarce side.\n\n\n- Kaplan (B, C)\nGood for acquiring a general knowledge of previously unknown material, however the Princeton Review book is required for more in-depth knowledge. Practice tests are much easier than the real thing.\n\n- Princeton Review (A)\nExplanation of concepts is hard to understand, but practice tests are extremely accurate, although there aren't many of them.\n\n\nChinese with Listening:\nSat II Vol 2 W/ CD (Chinese Edition)\nonly SAT Chinese book out there. Written by the College Board.\nAmazon.com: Sat II Vol 2 W/ CD (Chinese Edition): College Board: Books\n\nFrench:\n\n- Princeton Review (A, B, C, D, G)\nThe French exam is very centered on grammar, so a lot of the book is focused on that, which makes it a bit dull and boring. However, the practice tests were extremely accurate.\nRecommender's score: 760 (but on the listening exam...)\n-REA\nREA has a really good book for SAT French. It has some really good grammar explanations and its practice tests are pretty accurate.\nRecommender\u2019s score: 750\n\nFrench with Listening:\n\n- Princeton Review (A, C, G)\nThe book includes a very short and unhelpful section for students who will take the listening exam, but at least they tried. The book is good for the reading-based portion of the exam.\nRecommender's score: 760.\n\n- Barron's (B, C)\nThis book includes a CD for the listening section, however it has its drawbacks. The same people were used for all the clips on the CD, which is bad because you get used to their voices. This could make you have to strain to listen to the people for the real test. It's better than nothing, though.\nRecommender's score: 760.\n\n\n- Barron's (A, C, D, H)\nSlightly inaccurate practice tests, but the fact that there are many of them compensates for this.\n\n- Kaplan (B+, E, G)\nThe book is extremely organized and in-depth so it is more for learning rather than for reviewing. Regardless, it gives in-depth lessons and explanation of grammatical rules (very important in Spanish). Tons of great practice questions, as well as a great diagnostic test. My score went from a 650 to a 740 with this book.\nRecommender's score: 740.\n\nSpanish with Listening:\n\n- Barron's (A, C, D)\nSee comments for Spanish without listening.\n\n\n\n-Scholastic Aptitude Test SAT Subject Test \ud55c\uad6d\uc5b4 \uc2dc\ud5d8 \uc900\ube44\uc11c (cassette tape included) compiled by SAT II \ud55c\uad6d\uc5b4\uc9c4\ud765\uc7ac\ub2e8 and published by: YBM/Si-sa (Copyrighted in ROK) [one of the only two books that were found after weeks of searching]\nUnfortunately it\u2019s for Korean speakers only as the whole book uses sparse English (only for necessary translations when reviewing contents and for directions on the practice tests) unless the user is highly proficient at Korean. Personally as a native speaker, I like this book more because it covers various topics and serves as a decent review.\n\n-\ud55c\uad6d\uc5b4 \uc2dc\ud5d8\ubb38\uc81c\uc9d1 SAT II Korean with Listening by: Insook Jung Cho publisher: Hollym International Corp.

I got only a 7 on the real SAT on January 2015 and that drags my score down a lot. So I have been practicing to improve. The essays below are completed in around thirty minutes. Thanks!\n\n__________________________________________________________________________\n\n\nPrompt: Is the way something seems to be always the same as it actually is?\n\nThe ostensible apparentness of something may not be the same as it actually is, because our mind has the inherent proclivity for partiality based on our experiences, beliefs and views of life towards a certain perception. The veracity of this claim is exemplified by the work of literature such as The Cuckoo's Calling, To Kill A Mockingbird, and The Necklace.\n\nIn J.K. Rowling's The Cuckoo's Calling, the real cause of Lula Landry's death is obscured less by the murderer's weak schemes than by the police officers' pertinacious beliefs that Lula Landry is a troubled model with mental disorders. Because the officers believe Lula Landry to be depressed, the investigation is led by partisan thoughts impervious to details that point to the true direction. The case is closed, concluding that the model had commited suicide, and it is not until three months after when a private investigator Cormoran Strike looks through the case as an objective outsider that the murderer is revealed and apprehended. The story shows that what appears to be the case might not be the actual case after all.\n\nThe same idea is also found in Harper Lee's To Kill A Mocking Bird. In the book, the narrator Scout Finch and her friends view Arthur Radley, a man who has never set his foot outside his house for fifteen years, as the phantom, enigmatic and unknown, of their town. However, as the story proceeds Scout finds the phantom materializing from the mysterious mist of rumours and tales into a being, a human just like her. Arthur Radley gives the children presents and mends their torn clothes, and when Scout is attacked by a corrupted man it is Radley who shows up and rescues her from the turmoil. Scout finally realizes that Arthur Radley is after all a human, which accentuates that the veracity of something cannot be assessed only from its appearance.\n\nJust like the demise of Lula Landry and the existence of Arthur Radley, the necklace in Guy de Maupassant's The Necklace is misconstrued because the mind of its evaluator is inclined towards a certain belief. Mathilde Loisel wants to be rich, and when she is invited to a ball her desire to appear affluent intensifies. When her husband suggests flowers as decorous accessories, she declined, demanding a diamond necklace. This eventually leads her to borrow a necklace from her opulent friend, of whom Loisel is jealous. At the ball, Loisel is jubilated, for she believes the diamond on the necklace to be genuine and not, as is the actual case, artificial.\n\nThe outward appearance does not verify and substantiate what its body really is. Highlighted by the three stories discussed above, the way something seems to be is not always the same as it actually is.\n\n__________________________________________________________________________\n\nPrompt: Is it sometimes necessary to be impolite?\n\nImpoliteness is crucial in certain circumstances, for it can accentuate one\u2019s pertinacious beliefs and unwavering wills and safe one from otherwise inevitable turmoil. The veracity of this claim is exemplified in John Steinbeck\u2019s Of Mice And Men and The Pearl.\n\nThe idea that impudence can avert one from perennial fight is depicted in John Steinbeck\u2019s Of Mice And Men. George and Lennie, like any other Americans during the Great Depression, want to pursue the American Dream; they desire for their own land and be their own masters. However, since both of them do not have ample money to purchase a piece of land, George and Lennie decides to work until they earn enough cash in a farm, whose owner has a son named Curley. Upon their arrival, Curley notices the vulnerability of Lennie who has some kind of mental disabilities; an inveterate ruffian, Curley irritates and bullies Lennie in many ways. Lennie, however, does not retaliate, because it is incumbent on him not to cause any trouble that may results in the two of them being ousted out of the farm. But in the end, when Curley has positively crossed the line, George tells Lennie to fight back so that Curley would learn his lessons. By doing so, Lennie ends further torments that may otherwise follow him forever. Although Curley is the proprietor\u2019s son, it is imperative that Lennie responds Curley\u2019s impoliteness so he would be bullied no more.\n\nLike the story from Of Mice And Men, the storyline from The Pearl of the same author highlights the fact that impertinence is important in specific situations. When Kino, the protagonist of the novella, discovers the most prodigious pearl the villagers have ever seen, he agrees with his wife to sell their treasure for a significant sum of money to cure the baby boy, Coyotito, and to fulfill their other hitherto impossible dreams. However, when Kino travels to the city to bargain with the dealers, he eventually finds out that every possible buyer conspires to depreciate the price of his pearl. Consequently, Kino has to be impolite to state the fair price with a resolute determination, and when that does not work, to extricate himself from these iniquitous dealers and traverse back empty-handed to his village. Had Kino remained passive and compromise to the price set by the buyers, he would have surely been cheated.\n\nIn a given situation, politeness can be detrimental. When one finds oneself in such aforementioned situation, one must be impolite to stand for one\u2019s own principles or to put an end to an incipient quarrel as accentuated by John Steinbeck\u2019s Of Mice and Men and The Pearl.

I can't play a sport to save my life. I suck at math and science. So basically, I have no hooks.\n\nBack when I was a kid, I'd say I did pretty well in school. I got by middle school with straight As without much studying, and I was on par with all of my high achieving friends (who are going to top universities next year). However, once high school started, everything started to go downhill. I go to one of the top public schools in the state, and it is very well respected by universities for its rigorous and strong academics. Of course, I didn't know this when I started high school, and I thought I could get straight As and not study -- just like I did in middle school. Big mistake.\n\nI ended my first semester of freshman year with across-the-board Bs and B-s. I thought to myself, once I get used to this environment, I'll be able to pull off straight As like before, no problem. But it didn't get better. By the end of my freshman year, I had straight Bs while all of my smart friends got mostly As.\n\nSophomore year was even worse. I struggled through my first AP class (chem, which was the hardest AP in the school), and consistently got Ds and Cs on tests. I was also too lazy to do my homework or study for my other classes. Usually, I'd just go home from school every day and watch Youtube videos/play video games instead of focusing on schoolwork. My filthy work habits resulted in even worse grades than last year's -- my sophomore GPA was below 3.0.\n\nNow by then, I knew that junior year was the most important year of high school and that I couldn't screw up. I went into junior year determined to turn myself around. Still, the allure of Facebook, Youtube, and Warcraft III was still too strong, and destroyed my attempts to get a better academic record. As a result, I ended my first marking period of junior year with 3 Cs. I was angry at myself for screwing up -- for handicapping myself so early in the year.\n\nDuring my second marking period, I did a little better and got all B+s. However, my slacker attitude had not prepared me well for midterms, and I was completely destroyed by them. I got a D- on my AP calc AB midterm and got low Bs in the rest of them. This was when everything began to change.\n\nRight after midterms were finished, a lot of my high-achieving friends began to talk about colleges and their plans after high school. I consistently heard about their dream schools -- Penn, Cornell, Princeton, Carnegie Mellon, UNC, UVA... While my friends were already looking into their dream schools, I didn't even KNOW what school I wanted to go to yet. Worse yet, I didn't have the stats to make it into any school beyond my flagship state school, Rutgers.\n\nThat was when I really decided to turn my life around and stop being such a slacker. SATs were coming up, and I knew that they would be my best chance to improve my academics for college. I got a 2150, a respectable score, on my first try, but I wanted more. I went to Barnes and Noble every weekend to study for the SATs. I borrowed various prep books from the shelves to do problems in my notebook for hours on end.\n\nAt the same time, I worked harder in school, and actually managed to get some As for my third marking period. Fourth marking period was even better, and I got straight As for the first time in my high school career. My final year report was -- 2 As and 3 Bs in my core classes. I talked with my GC about my college prospects next year, and he gave me some advice that I don't really remember. The only thing I remember from that conversation was that he gave me my class rank. I was in the top 40% of my class.\n\nOver the summer before senior year, I really started to freak out about colleges. I finally knew that GPA was the most important factor, and that my horrid transcript would probably disqualify me from all of my college choices. Still, regardless of my 3.2 UW GPA, I found a \"dream school\" (UCLA) that I could work towards.\n\nOnce senior year started, I wasted no time with my essays. The college essays were my chance to stand out and show that I'm not the typical 4.0/2200/president of 130101359710 clubs applicant, and I decided to take full advantage of that. Instead of taking the traditional route of writing a generic essay about generic topics, I tried to make my essay unique by imbuing them with my own style and creativity. I read books like \"X College Essays that Succeeded\" and tried my best to make my essays look nothing like the essays in the book. Meanwhile, I took the October SAT and scored a 2290/1540.\n\nBy November, my essays were pretty much all finished, and frankly, I was very proud of them. They were all unique and I had a feeling they would do me well by setting me apart from the rest of the crowd.\n\nI applied to a ton of schools: Rutgers, NYU Stern, Carnegie Mellon, Michigan, UNC, UVA, UCLA, Berkeley, Georgetown, Wake Forest, Boston College, Duke, Cornell, Vanderbilt, and WashU. This list was laughable for someone with a GPA like mine.\n\nThen came the agonizing wait. Although everyone was nervous about colleges, I was particularly anxious because there was a very real possibility that I would end up at my safety, Rutgers. My parents' attitude didn't help -- they had no hope in me and constantly told me that they were disappointed in me and that I would end up at Rutgers.\n\nI checked College Confidential EVERY DAY, looking up decisions threads from previous years, seeing if there were any applicants in the past like me who got in.\n\nOver three months after I submitted my applications, my first decisions came back on March 23rd. I was hit with a total of FIVE rejections that day, including my dream school, UCLA. Receiving all those rejection letters from WashU, UCLA, UNC (waitlist), Boston College, and UVA left me devastated. I became depressed, knowing that I was screwed.\n\nHowever, Monday, the 25th, had much better news. I received acceptances from Carnegie Mellon and Wake Forest and a waitlist at Vanderbilt.\n\nMy final college results were: Duke (reject), Cornell (reject), Georgetown (reject), Boston College (reject), UCLA (reject), Berkeley (reject), UVA (reject), WashU (reject), NYU Stern (waitlist), Michigan (waitlist), UNC (waitlist), Vanderbilt (waitlist), Carnegie Mellon (accept), Wake Forest (accept), Rutgers pharmacy (accept).\n\nIn the end, I feel really fortunate that I got into three very strong schools with my GPA and class rank(was way below the average accepted GPAs for my HS). I think my story really shows how important the intangible factors like essays and recs are. I'm pretty sure that if I had written generic essays, I wouldn't have gotten into any of those schools.\n\nI'm trying to get off the waitlists of Vandy, Michigan, and UNC, but if those don't work out, I'll be attending CMU next year.\n\nAnyway, thanks for taking your time to read my story :D "}, {"date": "2012-05-04T20:08:31+00:00", "url": "http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/high-school-life/1335552-heres-a-morale-booster-for-all-you-worried-ccers.html", "messages": "\n                    I originally wrote this during spring break for myself so I could maybe one day remember what I went through during HS, but I've decided to share this story.

Of course you need to be realistic, but you should definitely apply to some reaches. You never know, you could very well get accepted to them.\n\nAnyway, thanks for taking your time to read my story. And don't worry, I won't make the same mistake twice in college =D                "}, {"date": "2014-03-28T00:32:51+00:00", "url": "http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/sat-preparation/1631197-from-1540-to-2310-my-success-story-and-how-to-improve-your-score.html", "messages": "\n                    My freshman PSAT score was a 154 (48 CR 51 W 55M). I know, not so hot. The following year my score jumped to a 177 (51 CR 67 M 59 W). Again, not so hot, and it was at this point where I really began to worry that I would never achieve that 2200+ or even 2000+ score that I so desperately wanted. So after my sophomore year throughout the summer I began to 'prep' and was able to achieve a 2090 (640 CR 750 M 700 W) on the October SAT. While this was a good score I new I could improve. On my October PSAT, which was actually only about 11 days after the October SAT, I managed to get a 221 (78 W 80 M 63 CR) which I was thrilled about; however I knew my reading could be improved upon. I re-took in March and I got a 2310 (800 Math 800 Writing 710 Reading) and for the most part, practice tests were my main method of preparation. For all of those who are interested in how this type of improvement can be achieved, here is my advice.\n\nFor critical reading, I may not be the most qualified person to give you advice, but I did improve my CR from 48 (9th grade PSAT) to 710 (SAT 2nd try). If I were you I would definitely purchase the College Board's \"Official SAT Study Guide\"  aka the 'Blue book' from Amazon. It's relatively inexpensive and is certainly one of the best available tools to improve your score in every section. The 10 real past tests it provides are excellent tools for improvement. I'm not sure exactly how you go about answering the Critical Reading questions or what your 'method' is, but I must say my score saw an immediate increase just by following the tips in \"How to attack the SAT Critical Reading Section Effectively\". That guide provides a new approach to reading the passages and answering the questions and has helped me tremendously. Beyond that I haven't done much else to prepare besides memorize some Vocabulary which can be found all over the internet - just google \"SAT Vocabulary\". If you want an actual book with the best words than both DirectHits and 'The Essential 500' are excellent sources.\n\nI really did nothing to prepare for math besides take a few practice tests, I'm just naturally gifted in that area, and I do loads of competition math (AMC, AIME, etc) which make the SAT math questions look like a joke. With that being said, I've heard great things about \"Gruber's Complete SAT Math Guide\" and if you're interested in additional materials, besides just the 'Blue Book', it may be worth the money. Gruber's along with the Blue Book should be all you need to improve tremendously in math. As with anything, the cliche \"practice makes perfect\" holds true with SAT math.\n\nNow writing I firmly believe is the easiest section to improve drastically on, as I've improved immensely from a 51 (9th grade PSAT) to a 59 (10th grade PSAT) to a 700 (SAT 1st try) to an 800 (SAT 2nd try). The essay was one area where I really improved from 1st to 2nd. I got an 8 on my first essay and an 11 on the 2nd essay and I would attribute most of this success to my amazing AP english lang teacher. However, if you aren't in AP lang or are not fortunate enough to have such an excellent teacher, don't worry you can still improve the same amount. One of the best tools out there for quick improvement on your essay that truly teaches you how to write it and captures the essence of what the SAT graders are searching for is AcademicHacker's \"How to Write a 12 Essay in Just 10 Days\". I would certainly read through this and start forming your 'template'. Now in terms of Grammar, much of my improvement was a direct result of simply brushing up on basic Grammar rules and going through practice SAT-type questions in Erica Meltzer's \"The Ultimate Guide to SAT Grammar\". Again, like Gruber's and like the 'Blue Book', this is an excellent source that can be picked up on Amazon. However, not everyone may want to purchase a book and there are excellent online alternatives. \"StrangeCamus's SAT Grammar Guide\" on CC is an excellent source of information for SAT grammar and costs nothing. Now it won't cover the material like the Meltzer's book, but nonetheless is a great source.\n\nNow a tutor is also an option; however, in my honest opinion, there isn't anything that a tutor can teach you that the immense resources available on CC, and on the internet in general, cannot. I do understand that some kids learn better when an actual human explains questions and techniques to them, but almost all of the questions you can possibly have can be easily answered right here on CC at your own convenience! People are practically drooling to comment on the typical \"help me with this math problem\" threads. Tutors and SAT prep programs are often used to keep kids who are a little less motivated and less disciplined on the right track and make sure they are actually doing practice tests. If you know you are going to practice often and you're motivated to improve then you most likely will not need a tutor. Now others may have a different opinion, but this is what I believe, and I base it off of my own improvement and the improvement of countless CC users.\n\nHere is a list of all of the aforementioned resources (and a few others):\n\nMust-buy's\n\n1. the College Board's \"Official SAT Study Guide\" - $12-15 on Amazon\n\nSuggested/Recommended Materials that can be purchased on Amazon (not necessary though)\n1.

You should probably find some alternate studies, because you will likely change.\n\n3.\tThis is probably one of the most underrated schools due to its relative easiness getting a job after graduation in the Twin Cities and its low cost.\n\n4.\tA lot more people than I would\u2019ve thought actually change their major. Lots of people come in with a lot of AP credit so the assumption is that students know very well what they want to do and graduate within 3 years, some even 2. As a result, a lot of people graduate late. This fact makes you feel a little bit better.\n\n5.\tThe NFL is way more popular than college football here.\n\n6.\tChicago is not considered a Midwestern city, and nobody here considers me to be Midwestern. Apparently Midwesterners really do look at Chicago as the New York of the Midwest.\n\n7.\tOn that note, a lot of people here judge you if you\u2019re from Chicago (or the suburbs).\n\n8.\tA Packers fan will never date someone from Chicago. That\u2019s OK, though, because when was the last time Packers fans were known to be attractive?\n\n9.\tThe university and the city really love construction: so many new apartments, the new light rail, and the new stadium.\n\n10.\tRap music isn\u2019t as big here as one would think (or at least I thought). I understand some of the lyrics of rap are weird, but people get too political about them (these are usually people from Middlebrook).\n\n11.\tSpeaking of, Middlebrook is still considered the \u201cweird dorm.\u201d The unfortunate part is that it\u2019s partly true. I\u2019d apologize to Middlebrook residents, but most of them agree, and I used to live there so I\u2019d know pretty well.\n\n12.\tI\u2019ve still never been to a high school party or a freshman party, but I\u2019m pretty sure they\u2019re the same.\n\n13.\tThe hockey riots after we lost the championship (which actually weren\u2019t really riots) were pretty funny, until people\u2019s cars got totaled and buildings were set on fire.\n\n14.\tA lot of people were really upset with those riots, including the president, but college students, when e-mailed not to do something, will go ahead and do it, because they were told not to.\n\n15.\tWhen a college team that does really well plays in a game that causes rioting, nobody knows who to blame, who went out of line, and who caused it.\n\n16.\tThe reporters at those riots were pretty f*cking stupid for trying to get coverage of what was going on in Dinkytown. Seriously, did they actually think they would not get interrupted by anyone?\n\n17.\tPeople get very upset over usage over the word c**t, even just when used for when losing in a video game or referring to a television character.\n\n18.\tGreek life here exists, but it\u2019s not at all popular.\n\n19.\tIn fact, a lot of students judge frat boys and sorority sisters, and a lot from Carlson.\n\n20.\tA lot of students here judge way too much in general.\n\n21.\tI don\u2019t know if this is for most colleges but a lot of people here are Liberals (advocates for gay rights, feminists,\nanti-racists, etc.)\n\n22.\tIf someone says something along the lines of \u201cOh yeah I love Black people,\u201d they\u2019re probably racist.\n\n23.\tThe \u201cMinnesota Daily\u201d often times bring up the lack of diversity and the university claims that they\u2019re working hard to increase diversity here.\n\n24.\tDrunkdonald\u2019s (the McDonald\u2019s in Dinkytown) is hilarious to watch on Friday and Saturday nights.\n\n25.\tThat McDonald\u2019s even has bouncers on occasion.\n\n26.\tBasically anywhere in Dinkytown is great to watch on a weekend night; you will find yourself in long lines when you\u2019re drunk, especially at Drunkdonald\u2019s and Mesa Pizza.\n\n27.\tCoffman Union is the only student union in the Big Ten that has an escalator. The tour guides mention this quite a bit when they\u2019re there.\n\n28.\tOur rivalry with UW-Madison isn\u2019t like Ohio State-Michigan; I grew up a big Ohio State fan, and I had to get adjusted with not detesting our rival school. It\u2019s more like a \u201cfriendly\u201d rivalry. Still, better dead than red!\n\n29.\tThey really try to get students to go to the games by handing out free tickets. This has gone down since the year before, though.\n\n30.\tYou\u2019re not an alcoholic if you\u2019re in college.\n\n31.\tA lot of hipsters or hipster-like people attend here.\n\n32.\tYou will most likely need to be in Greek life if you want the true \u201cpre-gaming\u201d football experience.\n\n33.\tGreek life is very expensive and time consuming.\n\n34.\tMesa Pizza is so good on its own. When one is drunk it tastes like heaven.\n\n35.\tThe campus is so ginormous you get so tired after going back to your place or to a class.

All of the crime alerts in the Fall semester showed me that too many students here are WAY too trusting. Really if some shady looking person asks to \"borrow\" your cellphone at night, WHY would you give it to them? Use your better judgement, don't be too trusting in a city (no matter how small), walk with a group of friends, cover all of your stuff, and don't show off anything flashy.\n\n42.\t A Minnesotan\u2019s job is to hate Wisconsin, the whole state and every single team, particularly the Badgers and the Packers.\n\n43.\tThe 2014 Frozen Four semifinal game between the Gophers and UND is the greatest hockey game that ever happened and have been played.\n\n44.\tThe 2014 Frozen Four final is the worst hockey game that ever happened.\n\n45.\tUnion College sucks.\n\n46.\tSo does UND and UW.\n\n47.

The last two just needed to be said.

When i applied it asked about any charges in violation with the law, in which i attached a description of traffic incidents from when i was 16. Im hoping that these dont affect my decision but what im really worried about is this:\n\nYou answered \"yes\" to the legal violation question on the admission application. If you did not submit a statement on the online application, we will need a statement of relevant facts for the following judicial question: \"Have you ever been charged with a violation of the law which resulted in, or if still pending could result in, probation, community service, a jail sentence, or the revocation or suspension of your driver's license (including traffic violations which resulted in a fine of $200 or more)?\" You are required to furnish Florida State with a list of all violations, and must include a statement telling us what you have learned from your past action(s). Please email your statement with the subject line \"Judicial Explanation.\"\n\nI didnt mention a charge that i received when i was 19 years old. It was a felony possession without valid prescription charge but has since been sealed from my record. What worries me is this, i was told that because it is sealed that i am to deny any arrest except for employment with the government, education or for certain licenses. Im not entirely sure about how university applications work. If somehow this shows when they check my background, can i be denied admission? Will it be that i didnt mention it? Even though its sealed? Im worried and application decisions are 3 months away so i dont want to start planning to move only to be denied, i also wanted to apply to other colleges but wanted to wait to see what i should do about this problem. I dont want to be denied because i didnt mention it, but i also dont want to mention it and be inaccurately judged if i legally do not have to mention it.

I know this is a long post but please bear with me. I really appreciate it, thank you very much!\n\nI'm currently a grade 11 student at a very gifted high school in Toronto, Canada, though I'm originally from Texas. I have aspirations for medical research and will be applying to accelerated med programs in the States such as PLME (Program in Liberal Medical Education at Brown) and HPME (Honours Program in Medical Education at Northwestern) as well as a program of similar prestige and caliber in Canada (the QuARMS program at Queen's). I may also apply to the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland as students are also directly accepted from high school and complete a six-year program which grants them an M.D. However, this is obviously not my top choice.\n\nI'd also like to apply to some top schools for purely undergraduate studies if I decide that it might be better for me to take the traditional path to med school instead of trying to save a few years. I spent a summer at Stanford University taking classes in Debating, Chinese Culture and Language, and others, between grades 9 and 10 as I used to be enrolled in their EPGY Online High School program, and absolutely loved it. I ended up dropping out of the EPGY with 65-80 averages because I was taking 3/4 of a courseload with them, and 3/4 of a courseload at my regular school. Those grades don't show up on my current Canadian transcript but I'm worried that Stanford will have record of it if I try to apply there. I've had a great \"rebound\" so I don't know if my history with Stanford will work to my advantage or not. Another reason I really want to apply to Stanford is their option to create your own major. I want to go into astrochemistry and do medical research in space. My initial goal was to double major in both astronomy and chemistry but it would be great if I were able to combine those into a single major. I don't know if this is a possibility at any other schools, I have only heard of it for Stanford.\n\nI am also really interested to applying to Cambridge University and the Imperial College of London in England. Cambridge was my dream school all through elementary and middle school until I actually started doing some research and found out you could only study one subject there. I decided not to apply but am now rethinking that decision because I'm wondering if I could possibly create my own astronomy/chemistry major there. Same goes for Imperial College.\n\nSo, therefore, I would appreciate it so much if anyone could chance me with these:\nStanford University\nBrown University (PLME)\nNorthwestern University (HPME)\nCambridge University\nOxford University\nImperial College of London\nMaybe Caltech, MIT, or Yale?\nAny other top schools/accelerated med programs that you think might be a good match for me.\nSafeties:\nUniversity of Toronto\nUniversity of Texas at Austin\nMcGill University (Montreal)\nRoyal College of Surgeons (Ireland)\n\nClasses:\nWe don't really do GPA in Ontario but I have approx. between a 95-97% average. There aren't specific 'AP' or 'Honours' classes but at my gifted high school all grade 12 classes are taught at an AP level (even if it isn't in the name) so I would assume all grade 11 classes are at Honours level.\n\nAll high school credits (the number after shows the corresponding grade level for the class, some with no numbers have all levels of high schoolers taking them, some with 1-4 show difficulty level, not for grade level).\nGrade 8 - French 11, Intro to Communications Technology 9, French 11, Intro to Business 10\nGrade 9 - Honours Chem and Mandarin 1 (both at Stanford OHS), Math 9 and 10 (I took one per semester), English 9 and 10 (again, one per semester), Foundations Science 9 and 10 (one per term, in Canada sciences are only specialized starting from 11th grade).\nGrade 10 - Mandarin 2 (Stanford OHS), Biology 12 - AP level (I started the year with AP Bio at Stanford OHS. My marks were down to a 65-70 in the middle of the year so I switched to my regular high school and finished the credit there with high grades, still at AP level), French 12, Latin 1, Drama 10, Civics and Careers 10, Advanced Functions 12. (I also started the year taking Honours Physics through Stanford OHS, but my grades were so low in the course halfway through the year I started having emotional breakdowns and being severely depressed so I was advised to just drop the course.)\nGrade 11 (Current Year) - Mandarin 11 (no longer at Stanford OHS, my school hired a new Mandarin teacher to come into my high school to teach), Physics 11, English 11, Chemistry 12, Challenge and Change 12 (equivalent to Psych, Socio, and Anthropology), Latin 2, French Civilization 12, Calculus 12.\n\nSAT - Will be writing in January but I am aiming for a 2100 or higher.\nAPs: Bio - 3 (planning to retake this year, might get 4 or maybe 5 at best)\nI am planning to take French and Mandarin either AP or SAT subject tests, and expect to get very high results in both as I am fluent in French and I'm not quite fluent in Mandarin, but my teacher thought I was at a second or third-year university level.\nI may or may not take the Chemistry AP or SAT subject tests next year in the fall (I would probably do well in that as Chemistry is my best and most favourite subject).\n\nECs:\nBlack belt in taekwondo by age 11\nCurrently a yellow-badge level in Foil Fencing\nJust started a mentorship with a chemistry professor at the University of Toronto where I will help her in the lab with her research, will last until the end of this school year.\nRegular volunteer with the Canadian Cancer Society.\nCo-Editor in Chief of my school newspaper\nWill be performing at my school Annual Fundraiser, I have taken singing lessons for 2 years but stopped last year.\nI lived on the island of St. Martin in the Caribbean all through middle school, and now speak fluent French.\nI travel almost every school break and have been all over the world, the notable trips being to Argentina, Chile, Brazil, Central America, Tunisia, all through Europe, China, Japan, South Korea, Israel, Alaska, and others.\n\nAwards:\nDon't know if this would really count but in Grade 7 I won a provincial spelling competition for French as a second language.\nGrade 8 Valedictorian Award\nGrade 8 English Award\nGrade 8 Principal's Award\nI have three or four math competition medals and certificates as I have been writing math competitions every year since Grade 8 (Pascal, Fermat, etc).\nNaNoWriMo winner 2012\n\nSummer Volunteering:\n-This past summer I was in Israel in the NFTY-EIE Summer High School program where I took classes on Jewish Culture and History (98), and Hebrew Language (100). I also got the opportunity to volunteer and rebuild the playground of an elementary school. I actually arrived in Israel a week before the war began and still stayed the entire length of the program. I went home a few weeks before the end of the war. I had a few scary experiences with missiles and will possibly incorporate that into some of my essays.\n-This coming summer I have signed up for a 2-week volunteer program in China where for the first week I take Mandarin lessons and the other week I teach English to elementary students.\n-This coming summer I am also going to volunteer at a hospital in Nepal for 4 weeks. It will be as much a volunteer opportunity as it will be to shadow actual doctors and figure out what areas of medicine I am interested in (we will be able to pick a few specialities and do rotations to work with doctors in each one).\n-Before last summer, I earned volunteer hours every summer at my sleepover camp for helping with the younger campers.\n\nPost continued in next comment.

Here's a TL;DR:\n\nI'm almost positive my proctor didn't give the 5 minute warning (as required by SAT) during a Math section and because I thought I still had at least 5 minutes left, I wasn't working at super speed to finish my last problem. I had the final step of solving the problem written in my booklet and I figured out the answer in my head, but as I was reviewing the answers to see which letter to mark, the time was called and I was confused because I never remembered hearing the warning while all of the other ones hit me like a brick. Also, there was no easily visible clock for me to keep track of how much time was left. Is there any way to recoup that last answer if I contact CollegeBoard about it or should I just forget about it?\n\n\n\nI took today's SAT which, while I was incredibly nervous for it and was trying to find any reason not to take the long drive to my center, it was pretty much a breeze for me. I had extra time after almost every section to double check my answers and luckily caught quite a few tricky SAT wordings and corrected my answers. I ended up running out of time during the second Math section and one of the Critical Reading sections, but the thing with the Math section (25 mins) is that I'm almost positive that the proctor never gave us a 5 minute warning. I noticed every other warning because I either immediately thought to myself \"No thinking time just process process process\" or \"Cool, I'll have plenty of time to check my answers\". I was even so startled by the warnings in the last three tests that I jumped in my seat because I was so focused (they were the two 20 minute and the 10 minute sections so I knew I didn't have a second to waste) and the room was 100% silent. Anyway, I was finishing the last Math question that I skipped to get back to at the end. The way that it was worded really threw me off and after thinking about it for ~20 seconds when I first got to it, I couldn't put the pieces together so I skipped it. When I got back to it, I realized I completely overthought it and it ended up a lot simpler than I thought. I picked some random integers for the situation, wrote out the math, and I realized what the answer was to the actual problem. And then time was called. I was really, really startled because I thought I still had 5+ minutes left.\n\nIf I contacted SAT/CollegeBoard about it would they do anything? I stupidly forgot to ask one of the other students in the room because our breaks were only 5 minutes and I was more focused on making sure I took a bathroom break during each one (thank god for the closer spaced SAT breaks, my first ACT was a horror story). I had the example problem written below the question with my example answer showing basically the final step before getting to the actual answer, but I didn't have time to write the actual answer (obviously I would've marked it on my answer sheet before writing it in the test book). Also, I know that I could've bought a watch to bring so I could do time management myself, but I expected there to be a clock in the room. And there was, but it was on the right side of the room, my seat was the furthest right seat, and the clock was behind me. I tried looking for the clock when I first got the room and when I finally found it, I realized that I'd have to turn my neck, turn my body, look up, try to get an accurate reading from the angle I was at, and it would simply take too much time out of the already short test sections. Not that their procedures are the same but both ACTs I've taken had a clock at the front of the room and the proctor wrote the start and stop times on the board, so a quick glance up was obviously a lot easier than how it was today.\n\nI mean, I would feel bad if the proctor got in trouble for it because they were really nice and it was an honest mistake, and even I recognize that I sound whiny/dramatic, but the confidence I feel about the overall test could easily backfire (happened with my second ACT, got the same 31 as the first one but I felt a lot better about it the second time) and I want a score as high as possible to send to Northwestern since I was deferred. I'm 99% positive that they gave no 5 minute warning because I was well aware of it every other time and I was maybe 10 feet from their desk.\n\nI read somewhere that the warnings are more of a courtesy to the students than a requirement, but according to this staff guide from CB (albeit it's for the 2013-14 cycle, but I doubt they'd change the rules for the next year) --- http://www.sde.idaho.gov/site/assessment/docs/SAT/SAT SCHOOL DAY TESTING MANUAL 2013-14.pdf --- it is a requirement to call the warning. Also, if you go to page 15, it mentions how not being given a warning is a common student complaint.\n\nI recognize that I was still given the full 25 minutes for the section, but if CB makes the time warning mandatory, even they must agree that it helps students by giving the pressure needed to finish as many remaining questions as possible. The only thing I'm worried about is if I contacted CB about it, would the results come too late for the schools I've applied to to be considered?

I was only four when my parents filed for divorce and at age eleven, my family was forced to move to a smaller home due to the economic downturn in 2009. This is when I saw how money ruined lives.\n\nWe were not always poor. I remember when we used to live in a fairly rich town called Eastlake. My parents had their own company called AceFa Systems in Mexico. However, as my parents\u2019 love slowly grew off of them, my mom had quit and the company was solely run by my dad. My mom had no job and constantly relied on credit cards as money. As her debt increased, my father had to help her pay some of it off. Having one parent working at the time, we weren\u2019t able to generate enough money to live in Eastlake. My mom then resorted to gambling, which she then became addicted to. Gambling with my dad\u2019s hard earned cash damaged our income exponentially which eventually resulted us in moving out of Eastlake to a more smaller, affordable home in 2009.\n\nWe eventually resulted in having to control my mother\u2019s gambling addiction by constantly watching her whereabouts. Both my older brother and sister ended up attending community college instead of a four-year university due to our financial conflicts. They also ended up getting part-time jobs to help pay off bills. Being the youngest, I still had the potential in going straight to a four-year university. My dad resigned AceFa Systems and joined a new business in selling dental implants. He brought my mom into the business, thus giving her an opportunity to apply herself.\n\nWe also obtained help from my grandparents savings. My grandmother was there always praying for our family and especially for my future, since I still had a fighting chance in reviving my family\u2019s financial status. She always reminisced about my uncle and how he was very similar to me, but ended up making the wrong choices through drug addiction. My grandmother hopes that I won\u2019t end up like my uncle and go towards the other direction. She really had a big impact on my life as I see her as my first teacher, since my parents were rarely there for me. My goal is to prove to her that I can apply myself within the real world and hopefully provide my family with a happier future.\n\nHowever, I was also very naive; I did get good grades, but I never had any impact on my surroundings. I never did anything to help my community, but all of this changed when I entered junior year in high school. I volunteered at the public library and then at the local Petsmart. Giving back to the community increased my understanding of how work isn\u2019t all about money. It made me realize that I should lean towards a career that the world actually needs. Most of my family members have careers in business; they only care about their own financial status. I now realize that I am the one who needs to choose a different path. After thinking long and hard for four years, I have finally decided what I want to do for my generation. Having a love for science and math, I aspire to be a chemical engineer in hope of advancing our future for the masses.\n\nPoverty at a young age inspired me; I now know I should never put money ahead of my true goals.

However, after plowing ahead and achieving \"success\" the person may find that they are no happier than the started. Success can be disastrous when one doesn't plan out the possible outcome of their actions and \"isn't careful what they wish for.\" In many cases the person will realize that they were happier before, but that the process is now irreversible.\n\nFor example, in George Orwell's novel Animal Farm, Snowball the pig thinks that converting the farm to a communist society will improve the farm animal's work conditions. In the process of establishing an equal society, he fails to account for animal greed, and gets betrayed by his political partner. He accomplished his original goal of taking the farm away from it's human owners, but as a result was banished from his own home, while life conditions for the animals declined below their original levels.\n\nAnimal Farm draws a parallel to many communist governments in the time it was written. During Stalin's reign of communist Russia, he began with the intention of creating a peaceful society with equal incomes and shared property. The Russian people originally supported Stalin's campaign, but as his government grew corrupt and strayed from its ideals, the people of Russia had no place to turn. The had succeed in bringing about a communist government, but had no way of escaping the cruel dictatorship it had become. This illustrates that what one wishes will happen is not always reflective of the actual end condition: in this case, success was disastrous.\n\nIn our modern society, people of all ages spend a big part of their lives engrossed with video games, TV, and the entire gamut of technological toys. Scientists have worked for decades to develop these products in order to advance human civilization, but in many cases, they are having the opposite effect. Children play video games instead of playing outside and developing social skills, teenagers sped all of their free hours staring at a screen displaying Netflix or Amazon Prime, and even adults consider social media to be more appealing than tangible conversation. Technology that had the intention of connecting our world didn't succeed on many fronts, instead having the terrible effect of distancing people from each other.\n\nEven those with the best intentions, \"who propel themselves towards the achievement of one goal\" can loose track of the desired end result and cause unwanted consequences.\n\n\nThank you for your comments!!!

I am a 4.5 yr senior with some time left in school and becasue of SAP i didnt get fin aid this semester this is my first appeal and everything in this is actually true.  If there is a  way to word it different becausae lack of documentation for certain items then let me know!\n\n\n\nTo whom it may concern,\nI am writing this letter to accompany my documentation for an SAP Appeal for the Spring 2015 semester.  My KSU ID number is 000511346.  As of Fall 2014, my current SAP GPA is a 1.92, which puts me .08 points below the required 2.0.  As a college student one thing we are supposed to learn is how to multitask and deal with different problems throughout our lives, and still perform at the best of our abilities.  My attempt at this in the past has been less than optimal because of my inability to focus on one thing at a time.  After I transferred to my third school (Kennesaw State) I had my life under control and I was feeling confident that I would start fresh at Kennesaw and begin to succeed as I did in high school.  Then personal problems began, and my focus was not directed towards my studies as it should have been.  Due to financial hardships in the economy I had to get a part time job to continue to live a typical college lifestyle.  Although this is not an excuse for poor academic performance it just added another thing to my already full plate.\nAs I began to neglect my social life and try to focus strictly on my studies and a job, I began having family and car troubles.  As a result of having ongoing major problems with the primary means of transportation, for both my sister and I, I had no choice but to pick up more hours at work.\nAt home I was starting to have family issues, with my parents being legally separated but still living in the same household, naturally my attention to things that should have taken precedence, such as school and work, now seemed less of a priority compared to the hardships I was dealing with back home. This would be anything from staying on the phone for hours with a parent letting them vent to driving down to Fayetteville in the middle of the night to make sure everything was okay.  Just being the oldest of two siblings, I have a responsibility to be there whenever my sister needs me.  There were times when I would have to leave my apartment or work to ensure the physical and mental well-being of the most important person in my life.  As much as I would like to elaborate on the extent of my family issues, some are extremely personal and I would rather not disclose them, such as health issues and even a recent mental hospitalization, even though they could help my appeal.  Unfortunately, I had to make a decision and my family and work came first and school came second.\nI have been in constant contact with my advisor, Hannah Santoro, throughout the entire Fall semester.  I expressed my concerns, and we came up with an action plan to not only increase my adjusted GPA but also to establish a more productive work ethic.  This is the final part of my appeal, and it will solely consist of my action plan and why I think I should stay in school.  I haven\u2019t just written this letter in hopes that I get my appeal, I have written this letter to prove to the university as well as myself that I am capable of succeeding at the collegiate level.  Though not dedicated in the past, I now have goals and plans that include everything from, a written plan of the rest of my academic tenure here at KSU , to a budget to properly handle my financial assets, down to the medial tasks that have made the past month and a half of my life so much more productive than its ever been.  One final thing I would like to say is I was put on academic suspension because of a grade error which was overturned, but the fact that I was possibly out of school for at least a year terrified me, and as a result motivated me to perform at a much higher level thus far in the semester (even though it is still early).\nIf the appeals committee grants the decision to overturn my Financial Aid decision, I will not take advantage of my final opportunity to show my academic abilities to the university.\n"}, {"date": "2015-01-21T12:03:30+00:00", "url": "http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/what-my-chances/1733552-mcgill-torrento-waterloo.html", "messages": "\n                    Hi college confidential community,\num an international prospective  undergraduate student from bangladesh.

The share price soared to a four-digit number and does not even has a tendency to stop, despite the shadow of the antitrust case. It is a triumph of the giant in the expanding mobile industry, and also the fact that Microsoft, Yahoo and other competitors in the mobile market are not willing to see. With a powerful search engine and the massive revenue resulted from it in the past few years, Google has already broke into new fields outside the search market and funded new projects that is completely free to public. Mobile market is no exception. The market is thus becoming unprecedentedly competitive and prices are dragged down due to the free irresistible Android to consumers. But this price discrimination is not unfamiliar to us. This is almost the same story as Standard Oil in early 19th century's robber baron era. Is Google really a 21st century version of Standard Oil? Is the antitrust law really effective in technology sector?\n\nUnlike the oil industry, Google is in the high-technology sector, the \u0093engine of innovation\u0094 [1] and the most popular investment destination in US. The issues there may have important implications for the broader domain of U. S. markets.\n\nMost of the antitrust issues originated here from the antitrust law and definition of antitrust itself. What are these laws and why did they come into being?\n\nThe first is the Sherman Act of 1890 [2], the result of a public outcry over trusts, the robber baron monopolies in late 19th century. This law makes every contract in introducing \u0093restraint of trade\u0094 and monopolizing the commerce a misdemeanor. Next came the Clayton Act [2] in the early 20th century, clarifying the Sherman Act in a more concrete way and resulting in a broad range of unlawful behavior including resale of products from retailers to manufacturers. Although more recent ones like the Robinson-Patman Act of 1936 further clarified the unlawful conduct in price discrimination, they are still based on the criteria of \u0093restraint of trade\u0094 from Sherman Act.\n\nHowever, these laws, from my perspective, do not provide clues of reasons behind these sections and so it is sometimes simply a dogma rather than an efficient stimulus to a competitive market.\n\nSylvester Petro, professor of labor policy in Wake Forest University, once commented on these antitrust law [3]: \u0093the Sherman Act itself, the basic antitrust law, has been and is being used, not to promote and maintain competition, but to discourage the abler firms from operating \u0097 to the limit of their abilities.\u0094 He further argued that there is clear distinction between \u0093monopolies in the descriptive sense of being the only producer\u0094 and \u0093using force to exclude competition\u0094. Although this challenges the previous belief of the Supreme Court that Sherman Antitrust Act a \"charter of freedom\" [4], it reveals the potential logical gap between the goal of antitrust law and the actual implementation. The gap lies in the fact that being monopoly does not necessary mean exclusion of competition.\n\nBesides, Alan Greenspan, former Chairman of the Federal Reserve, argued on this topic in his essay \u0093Antitrust\u0094 in [5] that the current antitrust law tend to discourage certain businesses from introducing more efficient products or some \u0093cost-saving mergers\u0094 that would otherwise be beneficial to consumers. He also suggested the antitrust law should not support competition as an end in itself but rather for its results \u0096 \u0093low prices\u0094. Even though this argument further challenges the idea of competition, it also raised the important point that the consumers\u0092 benefits and lower prices are the ultimate goal for the antitrust law to exist.\n\nA recent similar case to Google is the Microsoft\u0092s antitrust lawsuit in 2000. The issue at that time is about the bundling of Internet Explorer inside the Windows operating system. Netscape, Opera and other web browser producer claimed that the ease provided by bundling of Internet Explorer has prohibited their products from fair competition in browser market. The initial judgment is to split the company into two halves by strictly following Sherman Act and previous cases, which is similar to the situation of Standard Oil. However, Microsoft immediately appealed the decision [6].\n\nThis is not surprising, from my perspective, since this decision had not taken into consideration the uniqueness of high-technology companies. Unlike Standard Oil, the software Microsoft designed is a whole rather than separate pieces. Breaking up Microsoft may introduce more competition, but this is at the cost of replacing a complete set of compatible software with a set of inefficient ones from different companies. This result may not benefit the actual consumers and may also eliminate the pace of software development in Microsoft.\n\nEventually, Department of Justice and Microsoft reached an agreement that Windows platform details like API be shared to the competitors [6]. This judgment was very important to all the audience in the technology community since it protects the interests of ordinary consumers and also keeps a more fair competition between Microsoft and struggling competitors. Following the settlement, consumers can still enjoy the breathtaking array of new products directly embedded in Windows and also the competitive market is still being preserved. If the 19th century\u0092s trust cases are applied here, we as consumers may see a world overwhelmed with small software and the contribution of Microsoft in integrating tools together may not exist. It is also apparent that both Sylvester\u0092s and Alan\u0092s suggestions are implicitly adopted in this lawsuit.\n\nThe antitrust issue in the technology world, in my opinion, should also be based on similar criteria as above: a combination of both the intention of excluding the competition and the consumer\u0092s interests. The reason why any activity in excluding competition should not be accepted is that there is no social harm as long as everyone has an equal right to get into a market. This is because the social interests lies in the efficient production of goods. And as long as the market access is not limited, the nature of the market will bring about the most efficient approach. Even though in extreme case a monopoly may come into being due to its superior efficiency over competitors, monopoly in that sense does not actually has harm to the interests of consumers. Anyone else can still join the competition if they are competent.\n\nAlso the point of consumer\u0092s interests are also very important because this is the end we are supposed to achieve. Without this point, any innovative products or services with a dominant popularity would face penalty or even be killed by Sherman Act before they were born. And this would result in a situation that there really are many competitions on obsolete inefficient products. That is also one of reason Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., Acting Chief Justice of the U. S. in the early 20th century mentioned [7] for why \u0093 \u0092restraint of trade\u0092 in Sherman Act \u0094 sometimes is misleading when \u0093interpreted under common law\u0094.\n\nThis might contribute to the issue with the suspect technology monopoly Google due to its impressive nearly 80% share in search market. This large figure easily makes people relate that to an overwhelming dominance, a potential implication of \u0093restraint of trade\u0094. However, the reason behind the figure is more like the fact that the smart search engine and the impressive accompanying services than a coercive monopoly. The idea of funding free services from advertisement and marketing revenues actually benefits web-users in many aspects. The competitions are still continuing in a good market condition. So given that, even though Google is dominating, it is still far from an illegal trust.\n\nCertainly, there is some concern over Google\u0092s control on the ranking of search results. As mentioned in [8], this might be a potential threat to fair competition since Google\u0092s services might appear above competitors\u0092. However, this is not an issue with its dominance and its \u0093monopoly\u0094 in a descriptive sense and should be treated differently. In fact, the criteria being discussed above should still apply since the intentional control certainly hurts both consumers\u0092 efficiency and fair competition.\n\n\nWorks cited:\n[1].

If you want to do some peer review or collateral or something, post your essay up here and we can see it. I'm particularly worried about my examples, and whether they fit nicely.\n\nAssignment:\n\nThere are two kinds of pretending. There is the bad kind, when a person falsely promises to be your friend. But there is also a good kind, where the pretense eventually turns into the real thing. For example, when you are not feeling particularly friendly, the best thing you can do, very often, is to act in a friendly manner. In a few minutes you may be feeling friendlier.\n\nAdapted from  a book by C.S. Lewis\n\nCan deception-pretending that something is true when it is not - sometimes have good results?\n\nEssay:\n\nThe notion of pretense transforming into genuine action is a false one. Although the concepts of \"positive conceit\" or \"white lying\" may seem to have immediate benefits, they ultimately usher a hostile environment. Various literary classics attest to the fact that deception has a negative connotation.\n\nTake the novel Animal Farm by George Orwell. The novel centers on the life of animals on a farm, run without any human aid. The governmental aspects of the farm are controlled by a power hungry council of Stalinist pigs. The farm is in a very anarchist state, with little progress towards modernization and resource production. In order to seem successful, the \"voice\" of the government, Squealer, deceives humans by lying about the state of the farm. Although the humans come to believe Squealer's reports, the conditions on the farm do not improve in actuality. This novel suggests that lies to the outside world do not transmute to genuinity.\n\nThe Crucible by Arthur Miller exhibits the similar situation. The novel focuses on the revenge of an orphan named Abby, towards her ex-lover, Proctor. Abby plunges the town into chaos when she declares that she has seen others \"compacting with the Devil\". Abby's acts of deception towards others in the tow, including Proctor, result in the execution of many people. These people were executed because they weren't able to confess to \"nonexistent\" witchcraft. Although Abby's lies pervaded throughout the community, no one in the community actually practiced witchcraft. This play promotes the belief that deception regarding another's actions doesn't result in the action actually being committed.\n\nThe novel The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald must also be given consideration. The book is about a young soldier named Gatsby, who is unable to marry Daisy due to war commitment and difference  in social class. In order to gain wealth to raise his social status, Gatsby becomes a mobster. He drowns himself of his guilt by convincing himself that he earned money through hard work, and that it was for a good cause. Although Gatsby deceived himself, his lies did not affect Daisy, who refused to marry him due to his being a mobster. The novel shows that lying to oneself does not translate to actuality.\n\nThe phrase \"positive deception\" itself is a lie. Though conceit may bring about short term benefits in the form of reassurances, the end result remains detrimental towards society. A pretense can never turn into the real thing.

Introduction\n\nThe SAT is a 3 hour and 45 minute long test that helps colleges determine whether or not to admit students. The SAT tests students on three subjects: math, writing, and critical reading. Students register online, for a fee of $49.Typically, students arrive at the testing center at around 7:30 (though this may vary between test centers) in the morning, begin at 8, and leave before 1. The test itself is ten sections long, always begins with an essay, and includes an experimental section that doesn\u0092t count towards the final score (more on this later). Students receive their scores three weeks after taking the test, usually on a Thursday, and can access them online. If they wish to do so, students may retake the test at a later date. The test is important, but isn\u0092t the sole determinant to which college a student will be admitted to. Rather than testing one\u0092s knowledge, the SAT tests one\u0092s ability to analyze and understand information. The test does NOT ask you to memorize large amounts of information or facts, though memorization is a part of any effective study plan.\n\n1a. This Guide\n\nThis guide was written by me, cheerioswithmilk. I\u0092ve been on College Confidential for a little over an year, and noticed that there are many people seeking help on the SAT. There are many fantastic guides out there, but I decided to compile this one to share some of the more recent techniques that people have devised. This guide is not meant to be a comprehensive teaching device; I cover very little actual content that is tested on the SAT. Rather, it is meant to serve two distinct purposes. The first is for it to be an introductory tool to the SAT for those who are unfamiliar with the test. For this reason, I have included sample problems that are meant to give an idea of the types of questions. However, this guide is also a collection of tips that can help people boost their scores. Many people who have taken the SAT have already mastered the content, but are still looking to grab those last extra points. Whether your goal is to go from a 1600 to an 1800 or a 2100 to a 2300, this guide is designed to help you do it. However, do not solely rely on this guide; rather, this guide is meant to complement and not replace effective studying. Many of the techniques that I discuss are not my own (though some are). I have taken measures to give credit to those who deserve it, and wish to ensure that I don\u0092t present ideas of others as my own. However, the passages and sample questions were written by me, unless explicitly stated otherwise.\n\n\n1b. Why Study?\n\nTo some, this seems like a strange question. However, there are many who believe that the SAT is an \u0093either I know it or I don\u0092t\u0094 test, and hence don\u0092t study. The reality is that the SAT tests a relatively narrow range of subjects, and that studying can result in score increases in the hundreds. Although the amount that one studies is dependent on individual levels of ambition, I still recommend that everyone does at least something to prepare.\n\n1c. How the Test is Scored\n\nThe way the SAT is scored is a bit complicated, and there are some misconceptions about how it\u0092s done. I\u0092ll try and do my best in this section to explain how it works.\n\nEvery correct answer earns you one point, each incorrect answer is -1/4 points, and questions left blank receive no points. The total points earned on each section are then added together, resulting in the raw score. If the raw score is a fraction, then it is rounded with .5 and .75 rounded up and .25 rounded down. The raw score for each section is then converted into a scaled score, which is what really matters. This is what colleges will see, and is what you will see when you check your scores. The scaled score goes from 200 to 800 for each subject, for a grand total of between 600 and 2400.\n\nHowever, the conversion between raw and scaled scores is not the same for every test; the makers of the SAT adjust the curve each time based on the difficulty of the test. Thus, a more difficult test will have a more lenient curve. This ensures that the scaled scores remain roughly the same, despite the actual difficulty of the test. To establish this curve, the test makers use the experimental section, which is an extra 25 minute section of the test that doesn\u0092t contribute to your score; however, because it is very difficult to distinguish the experimental section from a normal section, be sure to put forth your full effort for the entire test.\n\nThe scaled writing score is dependent on both the multiple choice section and the essay.  The raw multiple choice writing score is first converted into a scaled score between 20 and 80. Then, this scaled score is corresponded to your essay score, which ranges from 2 to 12, to get the final scaled score.\n\nA few things to note: Generally, every question must be correctly answered to score a perfect in math. Very rarely can more than one question be missed. Reading is more lenient, allowing for between one and three wrong, depending on the curve. On writing, either a high essay or high multiple choice score can earn an 800; it is not necessary to have a perfect in both, though neither score can be too poor.\n\n2. The Plan in Brief\n\nIf you don\u0092t have time to read this entire guide, then this is the section for you. In three steps, I\u0092ll outline how to do reasonably well on the SAT. Ready?\n\n1)\tBuy the Official SAT Study Guide, made by College Board\n2)\tUse the book\n3)\tMake a College Confidential account\n\nThe Official SAT Study Guide, affectionately called the Blue Book, contains advice and lessons on how to tackle each section. However, the most important thing about it is that it contains ten real tests made by the actual test makers. As far as all the practice tests you\u0092ll see, none will be better than the ones in the Blue Book.\n\nI say to use the Blue Book because, all too often, kids will get the book from their overeager parents months or even years before the SAT, and it\u0092ll end up gathering dust on their bookshelf. Then, the week before the test, the kid pulls the book off, reads the introduction, maybe does a practice test, and then tackles the real thing. The book costs $22, so use it to its full potential.\n\nThe last bit of advice may seem a bit strange. College confidential (not to be confused with College Board, the makers of the test), is an online forum for anything college related. The forums about standardized tests are among the most popular on the site, and you\u0092ll find an enormous trove of information. In my opinion, it is a very important tool to anyone interested in doing well on the SAT.\n\n3. Recommended Books\n\nSAT preparation is a very lucrative business, and there is a whole host of companies that have created a dizzying assortment of workbooks, complete guides, and practice tests. Below I\u0092ll give my advice on which books to use for each section and the test as a whole, along with other resources you\u0092ll want to tap. Asterisks denote resources that I personally have used. Keep in mind that some books work better than others for different people; like with anything else, people will have personal preferences for prep books. Be sure to look through a book at a bookstore or library before deciding to use it. Prices were found off of Amazon.\n\nThe Whole Test\n\nThe Official SAT Study Guide* by College Board - $21.99\n\nSee my above blurb about this. I\u0092d say that this book is absolutely essential, required reading for the SAT. Like I said above, its advice is nothing special, but its practice tests are priceless. Recently, College Board released the third version of this book. It is a bit pricier than the second edition, and I would recommend sticking with the cheaper second edition as it has largely the same content and tests.\n\nHack the SAT: Strategies and Sneaky Shortcuts That Can Raise Your Score Hundreds of Points* by Eliot Schrefer - $15.00\n\nAn entertaining guide to the SAT. This book helps you get a sense of the test and understand more about it. It also provides you with lots of helpful tips and tricks. However, I wouldn\u0092t call it a complete guide. It\u0092s best used with other SAT prep books.\n\nReading\n\nDirect Hits Volumes 1&2 by Larry Krieger and Ted Griffith - $14.95 each\nI\u0092ve never used these books before, but from what I hear they are the most effective vocabulary lists by far for the SAT. The lists consistently perform very well in identifying words that commonly appear on the SAT.\n\nSparknotes Top 250 Most Difficult SAT Words* by Sparknotes \u0096 Free\nNot exactly a book, but definitely a helpful resource. This list is another great place to find words to study and memorize. Available online at sparknotes.com\n\n\nWriting\n\nBarron\u0092s SAT Writing Workbook* by George Ehrenhaft - $14.99\nThis guide thoroughly goes through all of the rules of grammar that you will need to become acquainted with. It does a good job of covering all the material necessary, and also includes several practice tests. The advice on the essay, however, isn\u0092t particularly helpful. Nonetheless, I would consider it one of the best guides to the multiple choice writing section.\n\nHow to Write a 12 Essay in just 10 days* by AcademicHacker - Free\nHands down, this is the most helpful guide to the SAT essay. It can be found online at College Confidential, and is definitely worth printing off. This thread lays out exactly what is needed for the essay. Following the advice given will almost certainly yield a high essay score.\n\nMath\n\nDr. John Chung\u0092s SAT Math by John Chung - $27.99\n\nThis is one of the most highly recommended math prep books. It has a large number of practice tests and tips to help you get a high score. Generally, it is regarded as being more difficult than the real test.\n\nGruber\u0092s Complete SAT Math Workbook by Gary R. Gruber - $14.99\nAnother good book for the math section. I can\u0092t say much about it since I\u0092ve never used it, but I hear that it is helpful for teaching all of the concepts.\n\n4. Tackling Each Section\n\nThis is the meat of the guide, where I\u0092ll explain how to take on each section. For the sections that have different question types, I\u0092ve broken it down into individual sections. For those of you who are already familiar with the test, skip down to the lists of techniques that I\u0092ve compiled.\n\n4a. Critical Reading\n\nThere are three critical reading sections on the SAT; two 25 minutes long with 24 questions each and one 20 minute section with 19 questions. In total, critical reading consists of 67 questions. 19 of these are known as sentence-completion questions, which essentially test your vocabulary. These questions are fairly straightforward and easy to prepare for. The remaining 48 questions are passage-based questions. You will be asked to read a passage and answer questions about the content. This second part is a bit more difficult, and is best prepared for through practice.\n\n4ai. Vocabulary (Sentence Completion)\n\nAs said above, these questions basically test your vocabulary.  You will be given a sentence, with either one or two words left blank. The answer choices will consist of potential words to fill in the blanks, and your job is to pick word(s) that best complete the sentence. Here is an example of a typical sentence-completion question:\n\n\nEx. Because Sally hated people of all types, she was considered very ______.\nA)\tamiable\nB)\tloquacious\nC)\tmunificent\nD)\tmisanthropic\nE)\treticent\n\nTricky? To answer this type of question, use context clues found in the sentence to find the word that best fits. Amiable means kind, so that can\u0092t be right. People who are loquacious are talkative. The fact that Sally hated people makes it unlikely that she would be talkative. Munificent means generous, which also doesn\u0092t make sense in the context. Those who are misanthropic, by definition, hate people, so D) is the best answer choice. (In case you\u0092re interested, reticent means shy and reserved).\n\nOnce you build your vocabulary, these questions become fairly simple. For example, had the question been written like this, you could have answered it in a snap:\n\nEx. Because Sally hated people of all types, she was considered very ______.\nA)\ttalkative\nB)\tkind\nC)\tanti-social\nD)\tshy\nE)\tgenerous\n\nI\u0092ve switched the answer letters, but the answer is clearly C). (Okay, anti-social isn\u0092t the best way to put it, but it\u0092s the best I could think of).Once you develop a mastery of vocabulary, these questions become fairly simple.\n\nThere are also questions where there will be two blanks instead of one. These questions are slightly more difficult, and it\u0092s generally recommended to answer the second blank first.\n\nEx. Despite the impressive ______ of the runner, Jim was ______ by his past history.\n\nA)\tsize\u0085intimidated\nB)\tpower\u0085paralyzed\nC)\treputation\u0085unimpressed\nD)\ttameness\u0085unfazed\nE)\thumility\u0085unperturbed\n\nI\u0092ve kept the vocabulary simple to make it easier to demonstrate how to tackle these problems. The word despite indicates that the sentence is setting up a contrast. Also, the words past history is a synonym for the first blank. With this information in mind, C) is the best answer.\n\nSo you understand how to analyze these questions. Easy. The hard part is that the SAT won\u0092t be nice and give basic words; you\u0092ll see words like curmudgeon and lugubrious instead. However, the good news is that the makers of the SAT tend to recycle the same words over and over again. Realizing this, many companies have published lists of words that appear frequently on the test. The books recommended above contain lists of common SAT words, but I\u0092ve also included a few lists that I wrote up in the appendix. You should also create lists of your own that contain difficult words that you come across.\n\nSo how do you learn vocabulary words en masse? Here are a few common techniques that are used:\n\n1)\tFlash cards. The most time honored technique, with definitions on one side and the word on the other. You can also purchase flashcards, such as the ones from the Princeton Review. Buying flashcards may be preferable because cutting and making hundreds or even thousands of cards can become tedious.\n\n2)\tWriting the words and definitions. Some people copy words with their definitions several dozen times to help them memorize the words. This may also be too tedious for some people, but is a good idea for particularly challenging words.\n\n3)\tUse a \u0093Gadget.\u0094 This is the method that I prefer, and requires the least work when using long lists of words (the lists included at the end were made specifically for this method). The basic idea is that you use a piece of paper to cover the definition but not the word, think of the definition, and then move the paper to check it. This is similar to using flashcards, but doesn\u0092t require hours of cutting and writing.\n\nAnother way to expand your vocabulary, aside from memorizing long lists of words, is to read. Read magazines, newspapers, books, and other texts that have advanced vocabulary.\n\nHow many words should you learn? I memorized around 2000 words for the SAT, although a large number of these were either repeats or words that I had already known. Depending on how advanced your vocabulary already is, you\u0092ll probably memorize at least a few hundred new words. However, don\u0092t spend all of your time memorizing vocabulary. Remember, there are only 19 sentence-completion questions, and the SAT is 170 questions. Vocabulary is important, but not everything. It can be tempting to attempt to memorize every last list and word that you can find, but this is NOT recommended since, after a certain point, memorizing more words won\u0092t help anymore.\n\n4aii. Passage-Based Questions\n\nThe bulk of the SAT reading is composed of 48 passage-based questions. These questions ask you to read either a single passage or a pair of passages. The questions will then ask about certain aspects of the passages. Here is a sample set of questions about a passage that I wrote:\n\nThe following passage was written in 2011. Recently, the Kepler telescope had discovered several earth-like planets outside our solar system.\n\nIs there another earth? It is a question that has plagued mankind for millenniums, going back to the time of the Greeks. The recent discovery of the planet Kepler-22b has sparked even more interest in this ancient topic. This planet was discovered by the Kepler satellite, a marvel of modern technology. Costing $600 million, Kepler was launched into a heliocentric orbit trailing the earth. The satellite is designed to stare incessantly at the same batch of stars, watching for a miniscule drop in starlight that could indicate the existence of a planet. Since its 2008 launch, Kepler has identified over two-thousand potential exoplanets. However, critics have expressed contempt towards projects such as Kepler; they assert that such projects are wasteful, and that money would be better spent on problems back on earth. What these critics don\u0092t realize is that projects such as Kepler help advance our knowledge and inspire children to study science. In addition, they represent a microscopic fraction of America\u0092s federal budget.\n\n1. In lines 9-10 (\u0093projects\u0085science\u0094) the author express his belief that projects like Kepler\n\na. are neither harmful nor important\n\n\nb. should be funded, so long as they don\u0092t divert funding from other projects\n\n\nc. are very important and cost relatively little\n\n\nd. were already thoroughly done by the Greeks\n\n\ne. require the help of the military\n\n\n\n\n2. In line 10, \u0093microscopic\u0094 is closest in meaning to\n\na. negligible\n\n\nb. crucial\n\n\nc. imperceptible\n\n\nd. wasteful\n\n\ne. irreplaceable\n\n3. The main purpose of this passage is to\n\na. present an unbiased assessment of the utility of Kepler\n\n\nb. inform the reader about recent discoveries in the field of astronomy\n\n\nc. explain the purpose of Kepler and defend it against its critics\n\n\nd. press the government to step up funding for various research facilities\n\n\ne. explore the philosophical debate about the discovery of earth-like planets\n\n\nThese questions were written to have similar wording, format, and style to those found on the SAT. These are probably easier than the real thing, but they give a sense of what to expect.\n\nBasically, there are two methods of attack when it comes to passage questions. The first is \u0093question first\u0094 and the second is \u0093passage first.\u0094 As the name implies, \u0093question first\u0094 looks at the questions before even reading the passage; the thinking behind this is so that you know what to look for when you read the passage. There are some variations to this strategy, but I\u0092ll try and describe it as generically as possible.\n\nStep 1) Skip the passages and head straight for the questions.\n\nStep 2) Look at the questions, paying close attention to any questions that have line references.\n\nStep 3) Mark up lines that the questions refer to.\n\nStep 4) Read the passage, paying close attention to the passages marked.\n\nStep 5) Do any questions that remain.\n\nObviously, there are variations to this general strategy. Some people like to answer questions as they go, and move back and forth between passage and questions. However, the idea is that by looking at the questions first, it enables you to know what you\u0092re looking for.\n\nThe other method is the conventional passage first, where you read the passage before answering the question. This is what most people do, but there a few things that you can do to increase your score considerably. Most of these tips are fairly generic, and are available from a variety of sources.\n\n\u0095\tMark the passages. Underline sentences that reveal author intent, style, or attitude towards the subject.\n\n\u0095\tCircle words that may have questions about. In particulars, words that have multiple meanings.\n\n\u0095\tWrite brief notes and words that summarize the main idea of paragraphs. Be sure not to make them too elaborate; one or two words are fine.\n\n\u0095\tPretend to be interested. Even if the passage is about how bacteria eat, pretend to be interested because it will make you more focused on the passage.\n\n\u0095\tFor the questions, have an answer in your mind before looking at the choices; then, choose the one that most closely matches your guess.\n\n\u0095\tRead carefully. One or two words can make a big difference. This is especially true when you have dual passage questions, and it asks for what the author of one passage thinks.\n\n\u0095\tStay focused. Losing focus will often slow your pace, causing you to have to rush the last several questions. Thus, it is important to keep up a steady tempo.\n\n\u0095\tCircle questions you skip so that you know to go back to them. Skip questions when it\u0092s taking too long to answer them.\n\n\u0095\tGo back to the passage, especially if line numbers are given. After all, the answers are in the passage.\n\nOne last note about the critical reading section as a whole: If you finish and have time left to go back, I recommend that you check the sentence-completion questions. Read back the answers to yourself, and if time permits, check the passage questions. Also, be sure to do any questions you skipped.\n\nThe first question asks you to interpret the author\u0092s attitude, and gives line numbers that direct you to where the answer can be found. You\u0092ll want to look beyond just the line numbers given; the entire passage may provide clues. When you read the surrounding lines, you can tell that the best answer is C). The author discusses how little these project cost in context with the entire federal budget, and also says how projects such as Kepler \u0093advance our knowledge and inspire children to study science.\"\n\nQuestion 2 asks for the definition of the word in context. These questions can be tricky because all of the answer choices may be possible definitions. The important thing is to find what the best definition in context is. This makes A) negligible the best answer.\n\nQuestion 3 asks you to assess the entire passage to find the author\u0092s intent. You will find that there are key passages and sentences that can help reveal the answer. Specifically, the author\u0092s rebuttal to Kepler\u0092s critics along with the description from lines 3-6 (\u0093Costing\u0085planet\u0094) reveal that the answer is C).\n\nThis sample passage was meant to show you the types of questions to expect on the SAT. Now let\u0092s look at some strategies that can help you tackle these questions.\n\nBasically, there are two methods of attack when it comes to passage questions. The first is \u0093question first\u0094 and the second is \u0093passage first.\u0094 As the name implies, \u0093question first\u0094 looks at the questions before even reading the passage; the thinking behind this is so that you know what to look for when you read the passage.

Thus, it is important to keep up a steady tempo.\n\n\u0095\tCircle questions you skip so that you know to go back to them. Skip questions when it\u0092s taking too long to answer them.\n\n\u0095\tGo back to the passage, especially if line numbers are given. After all, the answers are in the passage.\n\nOne last note about the critical reading section as a whole: If you finish and have time left to go back, I recommend that you check the sentence-completion questions. Read back the answers to yourself, and if time permits, check the passage questions. Also, be sure to do any questions you skipped.\n\n4b. Math\n\nMath is the section that most people come best prepared for. Often, you\u0092ll see people with amazing math scores, but mediocre reading and writing scores. The reason for this is that while reading and writing test rather obscure topics, the topics covered in the math section are largely taught in school.\n\nThat\u0092s not to say that the math section is a cakewalk. The way that the questions are phrased makes them tricky, to say the least. Typically, they resemble story problems, rather than straightforward algebra. Thus, learning to crack the wording is an essential step towards mastering this subject.\n\nIn this section, I\u0092ll lay down some tips and tricks to keep in mind while working the SAT. However, I will NOT go into detail discussing everything that you need to know for the math portion. That would make this guide much longer, and there are other guides out there that do a much better job of it than I could.\n\n\nTips and Tricks\n\u0095\tRead the questions carefully. Just like with critical reading, one or two words can make a big difference. For example, is it asking the answer as the ratio of x:y or of y:x? A few words make a big difference, so be careful.\n\n\u0095\tMark up the question, underlining crucial bits of information along with what the question is asking for. If it asks for what y equals, underline it so that you don\u0092t give x.\n\n\u0095\tPlug in the answers. One of the best techniques out there, it can save you from the more difficult problems. Since the test is multiple choice, simply plugging in some of the answers can eliminate wrong choices or even yield the right one.\n\n\u0095\tDon\u0092t over think it. If you are forced to employ calculus to solve the question, then you are doing it wrong; the SAT only tests up to algebra and geometry, so keep it simple and take the easy way out.\n\n\u0095\tLook for shortcuts. As I said above, the SAT isn\u0092t meant to be extremely rigorous in math. Look for sneaky little shortcuts that can help you out.\n\nWith that said, there is one type of question that is a bit more difficult, and has ruined many people\u0092s dreams of an 800. The \u0093which of the following is true\u0094 questions, with letters I, II, III and answer choices of a combination of these statements. Given that these rely more on logic than hard math, they can be rather difficult. Here, I\u0092ll give tips specifically for these questions.\n\nEx. From the Blue Book, Test 9 Section 5:\n\n\u0093If x is divisible by 3 and y is divisible by 5, which of the following must be divisible by 15?\u0094\n\nI. xy\n\n\nII. 3x+5y\n\n\nIII. 5x+3y\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe best thing to do with this question, and many more like it, is to find numbers that fit the criteria and see which of the following are true. For example let\u0092s say x is 24 and that y is 15 (in reality, there\u0092s an infinite number of solutions for x and y). Once you assign them values, plug them into the three statements to see which are divisible by 15.\n\nI. xy = (24)*(15) = 360, which is divisible\n\n\nII. 3x+5y = 3*(24)+5*(15) = 147, which is NOT divisible\n\n\nIII. 5x+3y = 5*(24)+3*(15) = 165, which is divisible\n\n\nHence, the answer is D), I and III only. Be careful, because plugging in answers won\u0092t work 100% of the time. Sometimes, you\u0092ll have to try multiple sets of numbers to make sure that one of the statements is definitely true or not. Be sure to try:\n\n\u0095\tIntegers\n\u0095\tNegative integers\n\u0095\tFractions between -1 and 1\n\u0095\tZero\n\nThe last three bullets tend to be the ones that spoil questions like these. If you want to use the plug and chug method, make sure to also test these.\n\nAlthough plugging in answers is an effective method for this technique, it is not full-proof. In order to be sure about these questions, it will be necessary to reason out the answer. A full length proof is not necessary, but being able to explain the answer in broader terms rather than for one case is a more definitive way of answering these questions. Employ whichever technique you are more familiar with.\nUse of Calculator on the SAT\n\nThe SAT allows both graphing and scientific calculators on the test, so long as they don\u0092t have QWERTY keyboards. Use whichever calculator you are most familiar with; you won\u0092t want to spend two minutes looking for that square root key.\n\nHowever, becoming good at simple computations in your head will help make you a better test taker. By doing an addition problem both in your head and with a calculator simultaneously, you can significantly reduce the chance of a slip up. Often, it will get to the point when you don\u0092t even need a calculator. However, I still advise that you use it, since calculators are a perfect way to double-check answers.\n\nPacing and Checking Answers\n\nHow fast you work through the problems is especially important in math, where there is an especially high chance for error. On math, you should always be checking answers, even if you have ten minutes left. I find that it\u0092s easiest to do the problem, make a quick double check to make sure I solved for the right thing and didn\u0092t make a computational errors, and then move on to the next question. Once I\u0092m finished with the section, I\u0092ll go back and check the entire section a second time. I tend to start at the end and work backwards during my check, since the later problems are harder and easier to miss. Also, circle questions that are harder as you go along. These should be the ones that you check above others if you are short on time. When I check I\u0092ll often redo the entire problem, just to make sure I get the same answer. If making a mistake is rare for you, then doing it twice will be almost impossible.\n\n4c. Writing\n\nWriting is the quirky little sibling to math and reading. While the other two sections have been around for a while, writing was added in during the latest remake of the SAT, not too long ago. Often times, colleges aren\u0092t all that interested in writing, but it still matters because it makes up, well, a third of your total score. Luckily, based on how writing is curved, it is arguably both the most teachable and easiest to master section on the SAT.\n\n4ci. Essay\n\nThe SAT essay is a 25 minute essay that asks you to either defend or challenge a statement. It is scored by two human graders on a scale of 1 to 6, resulting in a total score from 2-12. However, it doesn\u0092t really test your essay writing abilities; instead, it tests how well you can memorize and apply a formula that is almost guaranteed to give you a high score, if used correctly.\n\nThe best guide to the essay writing portion can be found on College Confidential under the thread \u0093How to Write a 12 Essay in Just 10 Days\u0094by AcademicHacker. Go ahead and search it to find the thread.\n\nI\u0092ll give a brief blurb about how to write the best essay. Generally, you\u0092ll get prompts such as, \u0093Is freedom something that we are born with or is it earned?\u0094 that can either be agreed with or refuted. Here\u0092s a step by step guide to tackling the essay, largely adapted from \u0093How to Write a 12 Essay in Just 10 Days\u0094by AcademicHacker.\n\n1)\tThe first thing to do is to come up with several examples that could support your viewpoint.\n\n2)\tTake a stance on the topic. Don\u0092t pick the squishy middle road, pick one and go with it. Don\u0092t change halfway, and don\u0092t try and compromise. Often, I\u0092ll pick the one that\u0092s more easily defended, not the one I necessarily believe in.\n\n3)\tThe first sentence should be your thesis, where you make clear what your viewpoint is in a clear and concise sentence.\n\n4)\tThe second sentence can be a bit of fluff in which you explain why you\u0092re right.\n\n5)\tThe third sentence should do two things. It should transition into the body paragraphs while restating the thesis, using different wording.\n\n6)\tThe next three body paragraphs (three, not two) should use examples from history, literature, contemporary society, or personal experiences (though generally I stick with the first three) that back up your assertion. Be sure to show rather than tell the reader why it is correct.\n\n7)\tWrite a brief conclusion. In your conclusion, be sure to restate your thesis and tie it back in to the examples given.\n\nIf you want a more thorough explanation, refer to the thread that I suggested above since it does a much more complete job of explaining the essay.\n\nI find that it is better to use a variety of examples, rather than all of one type. Also, your worst example should be the middle one and the best one your last. When restating the thesis, use different wording, but don\u0092t change the meaning of the thesis. Finally, start off each paragraph with a topic sentence that explains how your example relates to the thesis.\n\nThere are a few things to note about the SAT essay. First, make sure to write neatly enough for the reader to read it. Or else they will become frustrated and possibly give your essay a lower score.\nAfter completing the essay, go back and fix grammar mistakes. You won\u0092t be graded cruelly on grammar, but fixing small errors will make the reader happier, and of course, you want the reader to be happy.\nAlso, don\u0092t use too many SAT words just because you know them. Often times, people will sprinkle SAT words that they\u0092ve picked up all over their essay. Doing so makes your essay sound a bit fake, and it doesn\u0092t help to get your point across. A few words here or there aren\u0092t bad (I almost always incorporate the words \u0093corroborate\u0094 and \u0093incontrovertible\u0094) but don\u0092t go overboard. Stick with words that you\u0092re most comfortable with using. Finally, the essay does matter. The essay has a sizable impact on your score, and can cause swings from a few to 100+ points. From what I\u0092ve found, anything under a 9 will hurt, a 9 is mostly score neutral, while double digits will start bumping up your writing score quite a bit. Given that the essay is formulaic, these should be fairly easy points to pick up.\n\n4cii. Writing Multiple Choice\n\nWriting consists of 49 multiple choice questions that either ask to improve a sentence, find an error, or improve an essay.\n\nHere\u0092s an example of a \u0093correcting sentence error\u0094 question that you will come across on the SAT:\n\nTom enjoys watching movies, eating cupcakes, and to sleep in during the weekends.\n\nA.\twatching movies, eating cupcakes, and to sleep in\n\n\nB.\tto watch movies, to eat cupcakes, and to sleep in\n\n\nC.\twatching movies eating cupcakes and sleeping in\n\n\nD.\twatching movies, eating cupcakes, and sleeping in\n\n\nE.\tmovie watching, the eating of cupcakes, and sleeping in\n\n\nWhat you have to do is identify the answer that best corrects the error in the underlined portion of the sentence. You can see that the underlined portion is a list, which must have parallel structure. This narrows it down to B, C, and D, which all contain parallel structure. However, the phrase Tom enjoys to watch movies\u0085 does not make sense, so B is eliminated. C and D are identical, but C lacks the necessary commas. Thus, D is the answer.\n\nThe other main type of question is the \u0093finding sentence error\u0094 questions. In these, you need to find the part of the sentence that contains an error. For example:\n\nThe bear\u0092s menacing growl was more frightening than the coyote. No error\n\n\nIn this sentence, the error occurs at letter D. The sentence improperly compares the growl of the bear to the coyote, rather than the coyote\u0092s growl (if you don\u0092t see why, check out an SAT writing guide).\n\nThe final question type gives a poorly written essay and asks how to fix it. For example:\n\n(1) Running has many health benefits. (2) Cycling is good too. (3) It can improve heart health, strengthen bones, and build muscle. (4) Running is also a good way to meet friends and improve mental health.\n(5) Running became especially popular during the 1970\u0092s. (6) During that time, there was a nationwide surge in health interest, and people ran to get in shape, and were partly motivated by celebrities that also did so. (7) But then it died. (8) People began losing interest in the activity, and the craze slowly fizzled. (9) In addition, running can strengthen the cardiovascular system.\n(10)Recently, running has began to gain traction again in contemporary society. (11) Race distances such as the 5K, the 10K, and the running of marathons has motivated people to lace up their race shoes and go for a run while the spread of running magazines has also helped to push people to start working out to lose weight and improve heart health while making friends. (12) Because running is good for you. (13) However, it is generally recommended that a doctor be consulted before starting a new training regime. (14) Doing so can prevent injury and ensure that running is done properly.\n\n\n\nAs you can see, this essay is rather poorly written. The SAT will then ask questions about how to improve the essay.\n\n1. Which of the following is the best way to improve paragraph 1 (sentence 1-4)?\n\nA. Leave it as is\n\n\nB. Delete sentence 2\n\n\nC. Insert the sentence \u0093Cycling can also strengthen the pulmonary system\"\n\n\nD. Switch sentence 3 and 4\n\n\nE. Delete the phrase \u0093to meet friends\u0094 (sentence 4)\n\n2. Which of the following is the best way to improve sentence 7?\n\nA. Change \u0093it\u0094 to \u0093interest in running\u0094\n\n\nB. Add the word \u0093slowly\u0094 to the end\n\n\nC. Switch it with sentence 8\n\n\nD. Leave it as is\n\n\nE. Change \u0093it\u0094 to \u0093they\u0094\n\n3. Which of the following is the best version of sentence 10 (reproduced below?)\n\nRecently, running has began to gain traction again in contemporary society.\n\nA. Recently, running has started to gain traction again in contemporary society.\n\n\nB. Running recently has started to again gain some traction in today\u0092s society.\n\n\nC. Recently, running has begun to gain traction again.\n\n\nD. Running has traction in today\u0092s society.\n\n\nE. Recently, running has again started to begin to gain the traction.\n\n\nFor #1, B) is the best choice. Sentence 2, which discusses cycling, is irrelevant and isn\u0092t needed.\n\nIn question 2, it is unclear what it refers to. Thus, choice A is the best correction.\n\nSentence 10 is unnecessarily long and redundant. In order to fix this, choice C is the best. It clearly and concisely expresses the idea that there is renewed interest in running without changing the meaning of the sentence.\n\nThese questions were primarily written to introduce you to the questions that will be seen on the SAT. Like with math, I won\u0092t go into detail about all the rules of grammar involved with the writing section. Guides such as Barron\u0092s Writing Workbook will do a much better job of that, and so will Silverturtle\u0092s SAT guide. However, I will very briefly go through some essential tips.\n\n\u0095\tMove quickly. You will often get bogged down on some questions later on, so don\u0092t waste time. Also, the number of questions in the writing sections (35 in 25 minutes, 14 in 10 minutes) requires that you move much more quickly than on other sections.\n\n\u0095\tParallelism matters. A conservative guess would say that about a third of all questions on the writing portion ask you to sniff out problems with parallelism. Do the pronouns match? Are the verbs in the right tenses? If you can master this, then you\u0092ll be well on your way to an 800.\n\n\u0095\tCross out answers. This goes on all subjects, but on writing it\u0092s especially important. You don\u0092t want to waste time redoing something you\u0092ve already done, so mark off the answers in the test booklet that you know are wrong.\n\n\u0095\tRead carefully. Like with the other subjects, a few words can change everything, so be careful.\n\n\u0095\tIdentify differences between the answer choices. If it\u0092s down to B, C, and E, how are these three different? Which makes the most sense?\n\n\u0095\tBe especially careful when selecting \u0093no error\u0094 on the identifying sentence error section. These questions give a sentence with a potential error and ask you to identify where the mistake is. If you\u0092re marking up six or seven no errors, then you know something is up. However, make sure you don\u0092t indiscriminately avoid E, since odds are there will be some with no error.\n\n\u0095\tWatch out for diction questions. These questions will have a word that doesn\u0092t fit the context but is very similar to a word that does. For example, effect instead of affect (effect is almost always a noun, affect is typically a verb). These questions are relatively rare, and may appear only once a test, if even. This rarity means that people often fall for them without realizing it.\n\n\u0095\tRely on how it sounds, but be wary. The truth is, most of us speak with imperfect grammar. If it sounds jarringly wrong like \u0093she gone done it again\u0094 then it\u0092s probably wrong. However, for more subtle things, use the rules that you\u0092ve learned, rather than your ear.\n\nAs I said earlier, I truly believe that writing is the most teachable and easiest to get an 800 in. However, there is no way getting around the fact that hard work and practice are really the only full-proof method of mastering writing.\n\n5. Putting it all Together: How to Study and Prepare\n\nYou\u0092ve just been given a ton of tips and suggestions to prepare for the SAT. Great, but now what? How do you put this together into a comprehensive plan for the SAT? In this section, I\u0092ll offer additional advice on where to get practice tests, how to use them, and other techniques that I found useful. I you\u0092re looking for a complete \u0093plan\u0094, head over to section 6, where I outline the strategy I used to reach my goal.\n\n5a. Practice Tests\n\nA ridiculous amount of practice is the best way to improve on the SAT. Period. Reading prep books, guides, or surfing College Confidential will definitely be beneficial and I would argue even crucial, but the best way to properly train yourself for the SAT is through practice.\n\nGenerally, I recommend taking a complete SAT every Saturday each week before the actual test. The purpose of this is to give you a chance to practice and familiarize yourself with the content of the test. It is also a good way to track your progress and designate an appropriate goal.\n\nHowever, where do you find said practice tests? The best source of course is the Official SAT Study Guide, by College Board. The book contains ten practice tests, three of which were actually administered. Some people advise saving the three \u0093real\u0094 tests for last, but I don\u0092t think this is necessary given that all of the tests are accurate representations of the real thing. Another source of practice tests is of course the online SAT course offered by College Board, where you will find another ten tests. Then there is the SAT booklet (which can typically be found in your guidance office) where you will find another test, bringing the total to 21 tests. Finally, you can find links to two more past SAT booklets online at College Confidential. This makes a total of 23 practice tests, enough for almost anyone. Here is a concise list of the sources listed above:\n\n\u0095\tBlue Book \u0096 10\n\u0095\tOnline course \u0096 10\n\u0095\tSAT Booklet \u0096 1\n\u0095\tOld Booklets, links online \u0096 2\n\nBut what if you need more? What if you have to retake and spend a few more months studying? At this point, running out of SAT\u0092s becomes a serious problem. You can resort to practice tests made by testing companies, but these are often imperfect representations of the real thing. Here is a list of additional sources where you can scrounge up a few more practice \u0093tests.\u0094\n\n1)\tBuy the old \u0093Red Book.\u0094 This is an idea that I first came across in Xiggi\u0092s SAT prep. The SAT was updated around 2005, making the guide to the old SAT with only two subjects (verbal and math) obsolete. However, the math and parts of the verbal sections are very similar to the current one, and can still be used. However, I have never tried this technique.\n\n2)\tPSAT\u0092s. There is a PSAT booklet that may be of some use, but most people have likely already used it. I\u0092ve heard that College Board sells past PSAT\u0092s, but I haven\u0092t been able to confirm this. Although many say the PSAT is easier content-wise, it still is fairly similar in my opinion.\n\n3)\tAnd then of course there are the QAS\u0092s. Students can choose to order the question answer service, which is essentially a copy of the test taken. However, the exchange of QAS\u0092s is frowned upon by College Board, to say the least.\n\n4)\tIf necessary, use the tests made by other companies. Generally, Princeton Review is regarded as being fairly good, though a bit more difficult. Kaplan isn\u0092t good, and in fact copies many of the tests found in the Blue Book. The McGraw-Hill tests, I\u0092ve found, are too easy. You\u0092ll have to look through College Confidential to see what other people think of the other companies.

I'm bad at writing quickly. If there are grammar mistakes, it's because I didn't get a change to proofread.\n\nPrompt 1: can success be disastrous?\n\nThe sweet smell of success...right? Although at first glance, success seems wholly psotive \u0096 after all, who doesn't want to succeed in their endeavors? - often, what people seek is not what they get in the end.  The success people believe they will have often results in situations much worse than they expected. This theme is demonstrated in many works of literature, including the fantasy series, A Song of Ice and Fire by George R.R. Martin.\n\nThe first book of A Song of Ice And Fire, Game of Thrones, begins with the Stark family featured as the main characters. House Stark is a greathouse and a family made up of Ned Stark, his wife, and his four children. Unlike many of the royal houses of Westeros, the universe the books take place in, the Starks posess a uniquely healthy family life. Ned is a loving father to his children and he and his wife have a very good relationship in spite of their relatively unimportant social standing among the royal houses, as the goal of most houses is to achieve royal standing and royal favor from the Capital. However, Ned and his family are happy governing the rural and frozen north because even if they have a relatively simple life in comparison to their neighbors, it is a peaceful life.\n\nAs the novel progresses, Ned's social standing begins to change. He is visited by the king, who invites him to become the Hand of the King, an extremely prestigious and important position, as Ned would then be the direct advisor to the ruler of the entire realm. Many of the other greathouses express envy at Ned's heightened position, going from ruler of  the rural and unimportant north to basically the second-in-command of the entire kingdom. In other words, he has achieved success. Still, his wife warns him against accepting the offer, because she sees their current life as safe and she knows that once Ned has achieved such a famous and heightened position, both his life and his family's life will be in danger. Ned ignores her, thinking that the change will be good for the family. There will be more money, for one, and he will be able to secure high noble positions for all his children. By taking the role, the family will be in good standing in the eyes of the king, who is the ultimate ruler.\n\nHowever, once Ned travels to the capital along with two of his children, his perspective changes. Simply by being the hand of the king, Ned is now the enemy of many of the major players in the capital. When the king dies in a accident, Ned is suddenly not safe anymore, and his previous success turns into life-or-death situation. He is thrown into jail and eventually executed. One of his children remains a prisoner in the capital; the other becomes a runaway outlaw and must disguise herself among criminals. Even his family, still back in northern Westeros, is now politically blacklisted, which is truly deadly in the mideival-esque world they live in. Therefore, in hindsight, it is obvious that Ned would have been better off refusing the position of hand of the king in order to continue his safe, if less successful, life.\n\nOftentimes the situations people expect do not actually play out and success is never a guarantee against negatively changing circumstances. There are unexpected consequences in every situation. The guise of success can cloud one's judgement as it did to Ned, and although success may look sweet from far away, when one truly reaches it, it could be disastrously negative.\n\n\nPrompt 2: Is change that makes our lives easier always positive?\n\nAlthough at first glance, changes that make people's lives easier seem to be wholly positive, upon a closer look, modernization that first appears to help can often result in laziness and lethargy, which is overwhemingly negative to the human race. This lesson is shown quite promienently in the film Wall-E, which discusses the harms of modernization that can lead to laziness.\n\nIn the Pixar film Wall-E, the main character is a robot and the sole inhabitator of a ruined, futuristic Earth. Howver, what is unique about WALL-E is that this post-apocalyptical Earth is not the result of totalitarian goernments or all-out nuclear wars, which are common tropes in most other stories that take place in the future. Instead, the world has been laid to waste due to mass-consumerism, led by the megacorporation Buy N Large, a corporation that makes everything so \u0093quick n' easy\u0094 for people, that eventually, the entire planet is destroyed due to the environmental ramifications due to Buy N Larg'es \u0093quick n' easy\u0094 mantra. Wall-E is the last of the many robots that once roamed the Earth solely to clean up after the humans, who have since left the trash-laden planet. Therefore, simply the existance of Wall-E shows how lazy humans have become; rather than clean up afer themselves, they must leave the job to robots and leave their home to live on a spaceship, which is a direct consequence of their modernization and resulting laziness.\n\nLater in the film, when Wall-E gains access to the spaceship that the humans are residing on, this theme is taken even further. Every single human is now morbidly obese and unable to walk, due to the centuries that the humans in space have relied on the ship's automated systems for thei revery need. Therefore, it is clear that even though such changes have made the human's lives easier as no one needs to work, cook, clean, build, or plan, as the machines have become so advanced that they can do everything, it has not resulted in a better life for the humans, who are completely dependant on machines and cannot even walk by themselves. Mankind has basically turned in a group of infants, and as the movie progresses, it is clear that putting themselves in a position of such dependence on the machines, they have made a poor choice because the\nmachines seek to negatively control their lives. While life is now easy and free from work and stress, the quality of life for the humans has actually gone down from previous ages.\n\nTherefore, it is clear that  modernization that results in and easier life does not always translate into a better life. If anything, an easier life often results in laziness and lethargy, which can only negatively affect society because it often creates both health problems and a lack of independence and as shown in Wall-E we can terrifyingly easily lose what makes us human.\n\n\n(Haha, yes, I know the conclusions aren't very good but there isn't much time!)

Up till middle school, although I was never inherently athletic, attractive (whatever that means in 5th grade), or well-liked, I was deeply respected as an intelligent and superior individual, and if I never worked crazy super hard like many other Asian kids, I still always made at least a significant effort to excel both in my studies and my personal intelligence.\n\nIn 7th grade, my performance, which had always been superior, skyrocketed. I was praised massively by my teachers, as well as other students who noticed my work. I worked very hard in my 7th grade year, and while I was not the most popular, I always justified this by saying that I sacrificed my social life by working as hard as I could for the sake of academic success, and in turn invoke some great change or revolution when I became an adult. I began to believe that I could do anything if I worked as hard as I could. I worked harder than anyone, and that I was okay, because I was sure to become better than anyone as a direct result of my hard work.\n\nIn 8th grade, I moved, and my studies decreased again, and I ended up with one or two Bs. I concentrated mainly on making friends at my new school and combating my newfound depression. I did not work as hard as I had in 7th grade, because the other students in my class, while a few were recognized to be very smart, presented themselves to me as very, very stupid. I knew I could outperform them if I worked as hard as I did in 7th grade. I did not worry about bulking up anything extracurricular, and just played tennis as I had always had; time would come in high school to worry fully about college. Towards the end of 8th grade, I woke up, and decided to make again my transition to the hard-working student, this time for real, for the sake of my long-living ambitions for the ivy league, law school, and beyond. I took several classes over the summer to bulk up my freshman year course load.\n\nAs a freshman,  I have been excelling in all of my classes, and earned the favor of most of my teachers, as a result of very much hard work. I am also self-studying two AP classes, participating dominantly in 4 clubs, and searching for volunteer opportunities. I am also working on a novel, and thinking about other ways to boost my extracurricular appeal towards highly selectively colleges like the HYP. I am also considerably popular, having made many friends during my 8th grade year. I am working as hard as I can at my studies, my sport, and my extracurriculars, and, even though I am not the number 1 most liked, or the most attractive, or the most athletic, I am the hardest working, and have thus received the esteem and respect of my fellow peers. Even though sometimes my happiness is negatively affected from all this work, I am satisfied in the long run perspective, because I am performing extremely well and I will most likely get accepted to a very nice college and eventually make a change in the world during my adulthood. It is a perfect emotional system. My deficiencies in free time and fun are mentally justified by my inevitable success and ultimate superiority, all as a result of my very hard, humble work. The only way to make a distinction from myself and the rest of humanity is my effort. My meaning to live is built solely on my notion of hardwork.\n\nUnfortunately, this year, in running for class president, another candidate, will most likely win. The election results have not arrived, but I am trying my best to force myself to assume she will win, as she most likely will. She is extremely popular, and supposedly intelligent, (although I cannot say for sure, since I do not personally know her yet.) She is from a different middle school filtering into our high school, and she is regarded as more or less of a perfect goddess. She is considered to be intellectually and academically amazing, and is also popular in the stereotypical high-school-clique sense. I am not sure how smart she actually is, but given the amount of parties she posts pictures of on instagram, she clearly has very little time to work as hard as I do. But the biggest thing is that she is involved in the student government association for our entire county, which I have not even heard of up until this point, but apparently she holds a very prestigious leadership title, among a leadership board of all seniors. Everybody knows this, and thinks she's inherently perfect and even over-qualified to hold a title as \"low\" as class president. I had just moved in 8th grade, and I was given no real opportunity or awareness of such things.\n\nShe will most likely win the election, and also win all following elections in the high school years to come, for progressively more important and thus college-impacting positions, on basis of her previous election, as well as her involvement and success in the county-wide student council. Given that my entire premise for satisfaction of life as well as existence rests solely on my hard work and resulting superior success, my entire philosophy is bulldozed by this girl's existence, who clearly is coasting by on the great things in life, enjoying widespread popularity, and will also win this election, and all elections to come. In normal circumstances, I would simply work harder to attain my own superiority and essentially use my rival's success as a motivation tool, but in this case no amount of hard work will actually allow me to overcome her popularity, and her early success with leadership position. She will most certainly use her popularity and her position to her advantage, and she will be met continuous student government success. While this does not necessarily destroy my chances for HYP, it does certainly impair them significantly, since she will constantly be topping my performance, at least in terms of being elected, and no amount of my hard work will be able to change this. Furthermore, my windows for future opportunities will be narrowed, if another student is holding the most esteem adulation of the class; All opportunity will either go to her by default, or split between us. Of course, my chances for HYP are barely affected from the big picture perspective, and I can always distinguish myself to the admissions board via another means than class prez (although I had really been counting on winning this class prez position for years). But, more importantly, her entire existence lie contrary to the justification behind my own existence, my own hard work, and my own happiness. She is showing herself to be far more superior to me in a category of which value I place significantly high regard, and she is doing it with far less hard work, far more popularity, happiness, and free time than me, and she is thus tearing apart all my self-justification for living, and all my self-justification for any imperfection. And she is doing this all the while significantly impairing my chances of the biggest dream and aspiration of my life, HYP.\n\nI know this might sound really petty and stupid, but I've built my entire life on this notion of my hard work, and this girl is tearing it all apart, without proving me the means to fight back. I really need the input of my fellow ccers, because you guys are the smartest folks I've ever really met. This situation is poison to me. I have no longer reason to work hard-- my entire work-hard thinking has been completely dismantled. I know I sound morally repulsive and selfish and childish, but my feelings are real. I feel like I'm going crazy and I don't know what to do.

I will attempt to address as many aspects of the program as I can in this post. Hopefully, the information here won't be a gigantic waste of space and will be of some use to the prospective pre-meds that will be arriving in a few months so that you guys will know what's in store for you.\n\n(This post is extremely long and disorganized. I gave you fair warning)\n\n\nFirst, the basics. The average student at NYU takes approximately 32 credits worth of classes in their freshman year. At 4 credits per class, this comes out to 8 classes per year, or 4 classes (16 credits) per semester. As a pre-med student, you are not average (as far as classes are concerned). You will most likely be taking 18 credits per semester, or 36 credits per year. This is due to the fact that Chemistry Lab is a separate course (we'll get to that later) and counts as 2 credits, so technically you will have 5 courses per semester. You could opt out of a class in one of the two semesters (18 credits in one semester and 14 credits in the other) but this is not recommended, considering that you will need to finish your MAP courses in a timely manner.\n\nSpeaking of MAP courses, this is a good place to talk about the actual courses that you will have to take in your first year. Virtually every pre-med takes General Chemistry I and II (with lab) in their first year, and the lab portion is mandatory for pre-meds. A large majority will also take Principles of Biology I and II, which was recommended to me by my advisor, and is especially important if you choose to be a bio major. Those courses are probably the only science courses that most pre-meds will take in their first year. You must also begin to take the MAP courses (Morse Academic Plan), which are liberal arts courses that are required in order to graduate. A course called \"Writing the Essay\" is virtually mandatory in freshman year. Most students also take a World Cultures course and/or a Conversations of the West course (both are social studies/history related courses) if their schedule permits it. Some also take a honors/collegiate seminar, single semester courses that are generally set in a small class environment that focus on a reasonably specific topic of interest.\n\nMost of these classes consist of two 1 hour and 15 minute lectures per week, and with the exception of Bio, require a weekly recitation section (small class environment). General Chemistry also requires a weekly clinic section where you practice problems prepared by the TA. I hate to be the bearer of bad news but as a pre-med, you will spend a considerably longer amount of time in class compared to the average student, which can be mostly attributed to Chemistry and Bio labs. Chemistry Lab meets weekly for a lab lecture (although attendance is somewhat optional) as well as a weekly lab that lasts 4 and a half hours (if you're quick, you can usually finish with plenty of time to spare). This counts as a 2 credit course. Bio Lab meets weekly for about 2 and a half hours and does not count as a separate course (I'm not sure why, although it could be due to the fact that you need to pay additional tuition if you have over 18 credits, and NYU didn't want to **** off the pre-meds that much). Including the chem lab lecture, that is a total of approximately 8 hours more that you may have to spend in class compared to the average student (again, this can be greatly reduced if you work fast in the lab).\n\nFor both chem and bio, there are honors level courses that you could take, and both work very differently. For Principles of Biology Honors (I & II), you will have the same lectures with the same professors (although in a smaller class environment with about 70 people or so compared to 400+) and also the same exams as the regular class. The only difference is that you will have a recitation section that students in regular bio do not have that will determine 10% of your grade. You will need to take a placement test during orientation week or welcome week in order to determine if you're competent enough to be in the honors class. If I remember correctly, the placement test for 08 focused primarily on biology below the cellular level (for those who took AP biology and used the Campbell & Reece book, the test mostly covered chapters 7-21 or so) although there were some other types of questions, such as a pH calculation. The interesting thing is, whether it's regular or honors, the professors teach you from the beginning and assume you know nothing about bio in general. Chem honors is a completely different story. My roommate took the class and apparently the professors are different, as well as the course material. Chem honors assumes that you already have a significant amount of chemistry knowledge and the course proceeds at a much faster pace and covers many more aspects of chemistry not covered by the regular course. The exams are different, there is no clinic section, and the labs are different as well. In order to be in honors, you must also take a placement exam, which I heard was much more difficult compared to the bio one.\n\nI should also note that it is virtually impossible to skip Principles of Biology or General Chemistry in your first year. AP credits are worthless when it comes to these courses. Originally, if you scored high enough on the bio placement test, you could skip Principles of Biology and go straight to Molecular and Cell Biology. Indeed, my advisor told me that I scored high enough on the test, but also said that they revised the rule recently since apparently many students have historically performed poorly in Molec & Cell after skipping Principles of Biology. I'm not as sure about skipping the first year of chemistry, but I do not know of any freshmen that were allowed to proceed straight to organic chemistry. As far as I know, the placement test for chemistry can only decide whether you get into honors or not.\n\nAs you can probably tell by now, pre-meds have to take a considerable amount of required courses and this translates into fewer electives later on. Luckily, we have some useful AP exemptions. Based on what I know, there are only two types of AP credits that are worth using as a pre-med. One is calculus. If you're not majoring in math and you scored sufficiently high on the AB or BC calc exam, you can bypass the Quantitative Reasoning requirement (there are other ways to bypass this course, such as 750+ on the SAT math section, placement test, etc.). In addition, if you took BC calc and your score is high enough, I believe that is enough to also satisfy the 1 year calculus requirement that some med schools require. The second is any language AP. The MAP requirements state that you must become proficient in a foreign language up to the intermediate level. If you scored 4+ on any language AP, you are exempt from this requirement. If not, this is ordinarily accomplished by taking a language course at the university for 2 years, or one year in an intensive course. For those who are not interested in taking language at the college, a language AP credit may allow them to fulfill their MAP requirements much more quickly. Any other AP is most likely not going to be of much use for getting out of certain pre-med or MAP courses. There is no way to get out of Writing the Essay, and none of the history/social studies APs will get you out of the corresponding MAP courses.\n\nNow, the classes themselves. I took regular General Chemistry, so I can't really comment on the honors class. For General Chemistry I & II, you will have all have the same professor (Halpin). In my opinion, he is probably the most competent professor that I had this year and from what I've heard, one of the best professors in the pre-med track. Since the class consists of over 500 students, lectures are held in a large auditorium. His lecture notes (which you're required to buy) are extremely useful. In fact, reading the textbook was not even necessary for me (I didn't take AP chem in high school). Basically, all you need to do is go to his lectures, understand the concepts in the lecture notes and how to solve the problems, do the homework and the clinic packets, and you should be able to get a respectable grade. Getting an A in his class is not extremely difficult, but will require a decent amount of work if you're not gifted at chem. There is a quiz and homework due every week during recitation and the quality of the TAs vary but again, your performance in this class is strongly correlated with the amount of work you put in.\n\nGeneral Chemistry Lab, on the other hand, was less than stellar. The professor (Rugg) gives lab lectures on Friday mornings, and those are usually not worth going to since most of the time, he reiterates things that are already in his lab manual that you will buy. Before every lab, he shows up for about 5-10 minutes to explain certain precautions you should take, and subsequently leaves the room. The labs themselves are usually, for lack of a better phrase, organized chaos. Many of the TAs in my lab section were internationals who had just come from China and did not know what was going on at all (I'm Chinese, and on more than one occasion, I heard one of the TAs explaining to several other TAs what the lab was about....in Chinese....on the day of the lab). As a result, we were mostly left to our own devices, and getting educated help was usually rather difficult. To cap it all, we found out that Rugg had been reusing old final exams when one of the chem clinic TAs gave out copies of one of his previous exams for practice. The final exam for that semester was identical to the one for the previous year, even down to the letter choices. The TA was subsequently fired. To do well in this class, your best bet would be to familiarize yourself with every part of the experiment beforehand (including the procedure) and complete everything that you can at home before actually doing the lab in order to save time.\n\nI placed out of regular bio, but since the honors course is very similar, I can still address the primary aspects of the class. Like chemistry, the lectures are twice a week for an hour and 15 minutes, with honors having a mandatory recitation in which students discuss noteworthy research papers with each other and a TA. For my school year, we had 11 professors that taught over the course of 2 semesters. Each one focused on a specific section of the Campbell & Reece Biology book, and each differed from the others in terms of teaching style and competency. The exams and homework questions were written by each of the professors as their topic came up, and as such differed significantly in style and content. Virtually every exam had problematic questions that were unclear, ambiguous, or in certain cases, not even covered during lecture. There was one particular test in which half of it was written by a professor whose usage of the english language was particularly questionable. As a result of all of this, the class is heavily curved. A raw score in the mid 80s will almost guarantee an A. The downside for the students in the regular class is that the curve applies for everyone taking Principles of Biology. That is, both the honors and regular classes utilize the same curve, and regular must compete with honors for the limited number of As available. The professors have stated that the curve functions in such a way that half of the class will get grades in the A and B range. In order to do well in this class, you must study and understand the powerpoint presentations that the professors give, using the textbook as a guide. Thoroughly reading the book is also a good idea, but keep in mind that the professors do not generally cover their entire sections.\n\nUnlike Chem lab, bio lab is not its own separate course and is factored into the main Principles of Biology course. Both honors and regular students attend the same labs, which students must attend on a weekly basis. The labs are shorter and more relaxed in general. Homework is turned in at the beginning of every lab, and there is a quiz on the materials covered in the previous lab as well as in the next lab. Based on my experiences, the TAs are generally more competent than the Chem lab TAs and explain the lab before the actual experiment.\n\nThe only MAP course that all freshmen (non-internationals) must take is Writing the Essay, which for me was the bane of my existence in my first semester. I probably spent more than 1/2 of my working time on that one single class. I'm not exaggerating when I say that more than 90% of the pre-meds I know despised it. The grading was arbitrary at best, and it was difficult, if not sometimes impossible to know what the professor wanted from you. I have heard that there is a small handful of good professors who will actually make a concerted effort to help you improve your writing skills instead of just telling you that your ideas fail like my professor did. However, your chances of getting one of them is rather slim. There are variations of the class besides the regular version, such as science and film. One word of advice, just because you're pre-med, don't automatically assume the science version is the best like I did (it has almost nothing to do with science). You will almost certainly regret it later. To this day, I'm still surprised by the fact that I was able to escape with an A-.\n\nMost freshmen also take either a World Cultures or a Conversations of the West course, or possibly both if they have room in their schedule. World Cultures focuses on the history of a specific cultural group during a specific time period. I personally have not taken ConWest so I cannot comment on it yet. Both classes come in many different varieties depending on your interests and the difficulty of the classes vary widely depending on the subject and the professor. However, my advisor told me that ConWest classes generally require more work compared to World Cultures, and she recommends that freshmen take World Cultures with Writing the Essay if possible so that ConWest can be taken with an easier class. The World Cultures that I took was Ancient Israel (the professor has changed since last year). It consisted of 2 lectures per week as well as a recitation. Overall, the class itself was relatively easy compared to the science courses. Again, the difficulty level varies between courses, so it would be wise to check the ratings of the professor as well as the course if possible before you enroll in it. NYU has a website where you can find these ratings: NYU College of Arts and Science Course Evaluation Guide\n\nAny remaining slots in a pre-med's schedule will consist of classes such as honors/collegiate seminars, MAP courses that the student could not place out of (eg. quantitative reasoning, language, etc), or major-specific courses not related to pre-med (eg. Intro to economics for econ majors). Since these vary considerably between each individual, it is not possible for me to address all of them. Most of the classes I covered are classes which the majority of pre-meds will take in their freshman year.\n\n\nI hope that this information will be of use to someone. I left out some important details since this post has already reached epic proportions. If you've actually read up to this point, I offer my congratulations. Clearly, you can see that I've learned nothing from Writing the Essay. If anyone has any additional questions, I will do my best to answer them.

I try asking the T.A. what I'm doing wrong but he/she almost always wonders too what I'm doing wrong and tells me to discuss it on the lab report. I'm also getting really frustrated that I follow the procedures perfectly and preread over and over again the procedures/lab but something always goes wrong, and then I look at my neighbors who have no idea what to do but somehow manage to get almost perfect results. If I'm heating up something, the thermometer always has to decrease. If I am expecting a purple solution, I always get blue. If I expect a solution to crystallize, it will vaporize. If I expect square waves, I always get sine waves.\n\nI just feel like the labs are such a waste if my results actually contradict the theory taught in class. What should I do to get better results? The funny thing is that I'm actually in a research lab.

However, preparing for the future is important because it allows one to not face the negative consequences of certain events and instead achieve the positive goals that they want to achieve. Events during the Iraq War and World War 2 show that getting ready for certain events to come allows one to not observe such adverse effects.\nIn mid 2008, U.S intelligence received information that an ex-al Qaeda member was willing to give information at a certain fort regarding the location of Osama Bin Laden. Knowing how this was a big step, the U.S intelligence decided to meet at a certain U.S base in the next month. Once the ex Al- Qaeda member arrived at the base, the U.S intelligence individuals decided to not let their mole go through standard security procedures in order to not scare their mole away and to avoid such a hassle. As a result, their mole was able to casually walk in the base undaunted by U.S personal. But by doing this, the U.S actually allowed for an attack to happen. Once the mole got into the base and met up with the U.S intelligence individuals, the mole set off a bomb resulting in the deaths of U.S soldiers and intelligence individuals along with many injuries. Eventually the CIA heard about this event and decided to launch an investigation of why and how this attack proceeded as it did.  Through this investigation, they found that this attack would have strongly been avoided if the standard security procedures had taken place. Had the U.S intelligence individuals at the base decided to follow through with the standard security procedures, many lives would have been saved even if the U.S intelligence did not get their information. This event  thus shows that preparing for the future can help one to avoid such negative damaging events, even if the future was only 5 to 45 minutes away in that particular bombing case.\nThe same idea can also apply to Adolf Hitler\u2019s tactics to fight the Russians during World War 2. Near the end of1942 during winter, Adolf Hitler wanted to desperately bring down the Russians as quickly as possible; so he decided to send his troops up to Russia. However, in his serious desire to bring down the Russians, Adolf Hitler failed to see how a Russian winter can turn the tide of war as shown in many previous Russian wars. Once Hitler\u2019s troops got to Russia, they encountered many adverse conditions such as the unbearable cold. The cold resulted in many soldiers dying from hypothermia. To make things worse for Hitler\u2019s army, the Russians knew how to successfully prepare for the winter and as a result were able to successfully engage the weakened German army. Had Hitler actually thoroughly prepared for his campaign and thought about how the seasons could affect the outcome of his army, Hitler could have saved many lives. This event thus shows that preparing for the future allows one to achieve goals successfully without negative consequences.\nThrough events of the Iraq War and World War 2, one can see that preparing for the future helps one to achieve their goals successfully even if the preparation may be a hassle. Without thoroughly preparing for the future and instead enjoying the present, one may not achieve their goals and consequently may face damaging and harmful consequences of their actions.\n\n\n\n\nThank YOu\n\n"}, {"date": "2010-12-30T20:53:13+00:00", "url": "http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/university-texas-dallas/1061350-readin-ritin-and-racism-my-utd-experience-so-far.html", "messages": "\n                    Greetings, everyone. I figured I'd sign up here to tell my story.\n\nMy name is Serge and I am a freshman at UTD. Started in January. I am an Emerging Media and Communication major. I've noticed that since I started attending, the academics have been great. I've learned the material really well and been able to do well on exams and assignments as a result, and I feel I am really learning.\n\nHowever, that is where the praise stops.\n\nI've been here going on a year and as far as friendship and social success goes, I'm still stuck on square one, grounded like a plane with no fuel. Every time I have tried to join a club or go to events or \"get involved\" (yeesh I'm sick of hearing that phrase) I get shunned, excluded, and bullied. The horrid treatment seems to be based on three things: racism, homophobia, and classism.\n\nWhen I approach people and try to socialize with them, I often get ignored and sometimes they even walk away and regroup elsewhere. What they don't know is, I have very good hearing and can hear it when one of them says \"think we dumped that (lovely word that begins with N) here\"... I've even experienced racism in the Pride club, ironically enough.\n\nSecondly, I often get a lot of people who either have outright hate or ignorant opinions toward gay people like myself. I've had the 'f' word yelled at me numerous times and have had shunning there, also.\n\nAnd finally, there seems to be a lot of resentment toward people from lower income levels/inner city backgrounds, which ties into the race issue. I constantly get mocked for having less than my peers and have been called \"ghetto trash\" several times. I may dress in very \"street\" looking clothes, but I by no means look like a gangster and actually have an IQ that's normal.\n\nWhen it seems like I have actually made friends, they almost always turn out to be horrible to me, always making sure I feel like less in the group and even bullying me. Frenemies, indeed...\n\nAs a result, I am isolated and lonely as all heck on a campus where most others I see have a group they are tight-knit with and run with all the time (save for the high number of hermits, but that's a whole 'nother rant...). It is nigh impossible for me to get the same result, it seems.\n\nAm I alone in these experiences at UTD or have others here had similar problems?

This is the (probably too in-depth) story of a major part of my life for quite a while now.\n\nLet me start by saying that this is the story of an unhooked, over-represented, high-achieving bright kid, like many of you, who started browsing CC a year and a half ago as a clueless HS junior. Back then, I would never in a million years envision myself to be where I am today, and with CC playing a huge role in it all.\n\nBackground: Asian, California, all As including 9 AP classes, 2260 SAT, 780M2, 720 CH, 800 Lit. Decent  ECs by CC standards.\nThe college search really began fall of my junior year. One of my best friend\u2019s moms who we knew as very college savvy--she had just had a daughter go through the process, and is a CC senior member (did not know this at the time)--was browsing for her then-sophomore D and invited my mother and me to go and tour the Claremont Consortium.\n\nAs someone who had had a very blurry and unfocused picture on the entire process/college in general up till then, that trip opened a new world to me. The most significant of the colleges we toured that day would turn out to be Harvey Mudd--I fell in love with the quirky nerd culture, unicycles, pranks, and friendly students.\n\nMy initial view was very naive and skewed--The CC mom\u2019s oldest daughter who was very smart and also unhooked,  applied to very selective engineering schools and was not rejected anywhere. I didn\u2019t know at the time that this was an unusual feat, and figured that I should have the same chances as well. Like most kids on here, I had always succeeded at everything, gotten exactly what I wanted, and figured this should be no exception.\n\nI was traditionally a humanities kid(easily aced every english test and class, read and wrote a ton in my spare time) but wasn\u2019t really attracted to the idea of it as a major or career. I liked science, but none of the hard sciences I had experience with really appealed to me. CC mom\u2019s D was an engineering major, and it seemed pretty interesting to me. (at least no less interesting than anything else I researched)\n\nI still have the original college list I came up with, with the labels I designated at the time:\n\u201cReach\u201d\nBrown(a friend went there, it was an Ivy, why not) Harvey Mudd, Stanford(I\u2019m from California)\n\u201cMaybe\u201d(my junior year self\u2019s equivalent to the CC \u201cMatch\u201d)--Cornell, Northwestern, and Rice, Carnegie Mellon(heard about it as a good engineering school)\n\u201cBackup\u201d--Santa Clara University(CC mom\u2019s D\u2019s safety) University of Rochester-\nMy skewed (and mislabeled) list, and the lack of any UCs demonstrate my naivete at the time :3.\n\nI dove headfirst into reading all about colleges, the SAT, etc., and in the process stumbled across CC. I\u2019m not sure when I went from browsing to obsession, but I do know I used it for everything and read hundreds of chances threads, and stats/results threads, soaking up information like a sponge. At this time I was also studying for standardized tests and the information (book recommendations, tips, especially xiggi\u2019s SAT stuff) was golden.\n\nLike most CC juniors, I read stats threads to see where I compared to everybody else, and developed the attitude that I should definitely have a good chance at most schools. Sure, there were those kids with the 2300+ SATs that got rejected from tons of places,. but there were also those unhooked kids with miracle acceptances to HYPMS. I resolved to be in the second group. I longed to get started with the process in the fall.\n\nI also began to narrow in on engineering as a possible major. Based on what I read on CC, I also applied to four STEM summer programs: RSI, Bank of America Student Leaders, SCEEP(UMich), and MITES. Researching the different engineering possibilities for essays(I remember googling \u2018engineering\u2019 and reading the Wikipedia profiles for the different types) made me more certain.\nOn CCs recommendation and advice, I also began an internship in a great UCI Medical Center Neuropsychiatry research lab that I still continue in.\n\nI visited Stanford, UC Berkeley, and USC. I didn\u2019t care much for Stanford--the campus was too resort-y. USC was too in the middle of the city, big, and loud, but the kids and school itself seemed good. UC Berkeley was probably my favorite of the three(and I also knew that aforementioned CC mom\u2019s D chose it over multiple other top-20 acceptances).\n\nI began narrowing in on what I really wanted out of a college. Above all, I really wanted to go out of state(I defined it as \u201ca place with seasons\u201d)  and somewhere really far, where it snowed in the winter time. I dreamed of east-coast private universities and saw schools like the UCs and USC as last resorts.\n\nThe revelation of engineering as a major resulted in kicking Brown from the list. Under pressure to balance my list, I also took Northwestern off and added Lehigh, USC, and UCI as matches and safeties.\nAt this time, I was becoming very savvy about the college process due to CC. The results for the Class of 2017 were coming out, and I began realizing that I actually didn\u2019t stand a good chance at most of the schools on my list! I actually had a crisis about this\u2026.until:                "}, {"date": "2014-06-02T01:17:28+00:00", "url": "http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/what-my-chances/1655323-international-application.html", "messages": "\n                    Hi!\n\nI know this may be redundant, but I'd really like to know if anyone can give me an idea of weather or not I have any chances of getting into Princeton (or Harvard, the University of Chicago and Columbia).\n\nI live in Quebec, Canada, so it's a little hard to explain my education because our education system is really different, but here is some basic info. Thanks for the help!\n\nHigh School (or our equivalent...):\n\nLanguage of study : french\n\nCoursework: I took the highest level of science and math as I could and the biggest workload offered. I even took a spanish class that didn't fit into my schedule because I had too many classes, so I had to go to school early.\n\nGPA: We don't have a GPA, but I graduated second of my class with an average of 94,2%. The girl who graduated first got 94,4% and she was an athlete. I mention this because I'm not and gym counts in our class average. I believe that this would translate to a 4.0 GPA, but again, we don't calculate it that way.\n\nSchool type: Private (which is a little different here; private schools basically mean the schools with a very very high academic level), ranked 4th of our area among private schools (we don't have state-wide or national rankings that I know of).\n\nWhat comes after High School and before college here ...\n\nWe call it CEGEP, but I guess that's not very important. It's a mandatory two-year program, I'm in the IB science program.\n\nCoursework: By the time I apply for college, I will have completed 4 physics courses (mechanics, electricity and magnetism, optics and modern physics as well as thermodynamics), two spanish courses (I tested out of levels 1 and two so I only did levels 3 and 4), four french literature courses, five philosophy courses, four chemistry courses, one biology course, a political science course, calculus I and II, linear algebra and a probability and statistics class. I also will have competed one IB exam (spanish) and will have predicted grades for the physics, chemistry, french literature, philosophy and math IB exams (which are highly considered by universities, or so I've heard).\n\nGrades: they are very very VERY different in CEGEP. Instead of looking at actual percentages or GPAs, the colleges here look at what we call a R-Cote. That means that if you get 80% in a class where the average is 60% your chances of getting into college are BETTER than if you have 90% in a class with an average of 80%. My R-Cote is 31 for my first semester, which is considered very good. For anyone who knows McGill university (in Montreal), it takes 27 to get into physics, 30 to get into law school and 32 to get into med school (and I think I will get a better R-Cote for second semester, so I could maybe get into med school at McGill after a third term and the McGill med school is the most prestigious and the most selective of the country).\n\nThe problem with this system is that I am only getting 80% in my classes. My average percentage for first semester is 82% and my overall average for second semester is 85%. I'm really worried that this will ruin my chances of getting into Princeton.\n\nExtracurricular:\n\nI did 12 years of classical ballet, 10 years of tap (and I'm still doing tap), 3 years of jazz and 7 years of intensive dance camp.\n\nI've played violin for 14 years and still play.\n\nI've been taking voice lessons for 4 years.\n\nI was head of the year-book comity.\n\nI am currently head of the student news paper.\n\nI was in a ballet video that was distributed province-wide to demonstrate the exam curriculum. I was one of three students selected from my dance school.\n\nI danced Nutcracker (a ballet) with the Montreal ballet company. I wasn't actually with the company, but they select students from dance schools to do certain parts.\n\nI went on a cultural exchange to Peru and a cultural and historical trip to Greece.\n\nI've been working in a part-time job for a year.\n\nI was part of the student council for one year.\n\nI was in a jazz vocal group for 5 years.\n\nAchievements:\n\nI won a bronze medal at our national science fair. I participated in the science fair for 5 years and won various prizes at the local level.\n\nI also have won various awards at school. If it helps, here is the list:\n\nBest GPA in 8th and 9th grade\nTop 10 GPA award in 10th and 11th grade\nJazz vocal award (twice)\nAward for academic and extracurricular success\nScience award (twice)\n\nIn my last year year of High School, I did a project where I created a website and a conference in which I explained the basis of quantum physics for beginners. If you want to check it out (either to check out if it is good application material, or even just because you're interested), here is the link to my website. My conference in on youtube in english and french and is linked on the first page of the website.\n\nSAT scores:\n\n\nI have taken the SAT once. I got 720 on the reading section, 680 on the writing section and 650 on the math. I will be taking it again in the fall and am anticipating higher results in the math section, in particular, because I was getting 700's in my practice tests. I'm not sure what happened ...\n\n\nI will be taking the chemistry, math II and spanish SAT II tests next saturday. I'll comment the results when I get them. I also plan on taking the math II again in the fall (in case my result isn't high enough) along with the spanish with listening and the physics test.\n\nOther:\n\nI grew up in a bilingual home, so although my schooling has been exclusively in french, my english is pretty good (at least, I think!).\n\nIf it makes a difference, I am an american citizen (my mom is from the Chicago area), but I am NOT an american resident.\n\nI am thinking of majoring in theoretical physics.\n\nI will be applying for the fall 2015 semester as an undergraduate.\n\n\n\nThanks for everything, I know so many people ask these kinds of questions, but I'm juste really worried I won't get in and since I don't like in the states, its hard for me to get any real idea of my chances of getting in. It's been my dream,  it seem like forever, to get into a big US school, so thanks for any comments! If you have any questions (because I know this probably isn't as clear on paper as it is in my head), don't hesitate to ask. Also, if you have any tips, I'd love to hear them!

They know how to deal with things and manage things through their happiness. Although  many people consider wisdom as intelligence, wisdom doesn't resemble cleverness. In fact, when a person is happy, he or she can think in a clearer way and take the best decisions.\n\nMy uncle's happiness, for instance, resembled how wise he is. I never actually understood this until my grandfather's death occured. When we all knew about my grandfather's death, we felt so sad and miserable that everyone was crying. However, Uncle Ahmed wasn't crying. In fact, I actually saw a smile on his face that I have understood later on. He taught me that because people cannot be happy all the time. They should act satisfied and content in the hardest times. Although losing a person is a harsh circumstance, people should feel content and think inside the box. Furthermore, they should view things from another aspect that makes them feel happy and wise. Accordingly, a happy person is a wise person because he or she knows what to do even in the difficult situations. As a result, (he whole society should learn that being wise means being cotent, if our societ learned that carefully, we would live in a better sensible world that has no place for dwelling.\n\nHowever, sometimes happiness is not an accurate scale in measuring how wise someone is. The widely known story, The Wolf of Wall Street, reflects for us about John, the protagonist of the story, how he felt happy only after being so rich. When he was poor, he hated his life and wasn't feeling satisfied at all. There, we cannot call such happiness as wisdom because materialism is not permanent. Eventually, John lost all his money because he was accused of gaining them illegally. When John entered prison, he then realized how his life actually had turned into hell rather than heaven because of materialism. So, he was glad to realize that even though it was too. Hence, John Wolf, in such situation, resembled wisdom because even though he got jailed and lost all his luxuries, he was calm and relaxed about it. As a result, we should take things wisely and look to the profound meaning beneath every surface in order to achieve happiness. We should all determine people's wisdom by how wise they are not by how intelligence they are.\n\nIsaac Newton was an intelligent person. He invented things that left mark on the whole society. However, he was not wise; He was smart. Hence, intelce doesn't resemble wisdom. In fact, happiness resembles wisdom because it determines how can a person keep a smile in all the ups and downs of life. To conclude, we should all learn from my Uncle's experience and from John's story that the happier you are, the wiser you'll be.

We woke up the morning of the test, handed him a pencil and a lunch and said: \"See you in a couple of hours.\" He asked: \"Why do I need a pencil, I thought this was a field trip?\" I didn't want to stress him and get him tied up in knots over a 2-hour test, so I hadn't told him.

According to what is written on the ISEE Individual Student Report, it says the Percentile Ranks and Stanines are derived from norms for applicants to independent schools.

Only by learning from past mistakes can people truly evolve and elevate themselves to higher levels. Without past memories, people would perpetually make the same mistakes and bar both themselves and society from significant and meaningful progress. The veracity of this assertion is confirmed in examples within literature and history.\n\nA paragon of this topic in the field of literature is Aldous Huxley's Brave New World. This novel describes the detrimental effects of not having past memories on a societal level. The people of its society have very little bearing of their past, and are ignorant of the mistakes made in their past. All old literature and cultural displays have been destroyed, leaving not even the opportunity to consider their past. As a result of not having the benefit of past memories, their society is clearly heading in an undesirable direction. The citizens have no sense of their cultural background and have very little personal connection with each other. The concept of having a family is actually considered derogatory, and love is a nonexistent idea in their society. As demonstrated by these harsh circumstances in their society which lacks the past, they are unable to progress. Rather, they actually regressed, as they lose the basic tenants of civilization slowly but surely. Therefore, Brave New World exemplifies the folly of not having past memories to rely on through its depiction of a regressive and unprogressive society.\n\nIn addition to literature, history also provides a fitting example that demonstrates the necessity of past memories. After WWII came to its close, the tastes of genocide and hatred were left in the mouth of the world's population. As a result, the United Nations and other peace organizations were created to ensure that nothing of this sort were to ever happen again. The creation of those peace organizations and the passing of peace legislation globally both demonstrate the benefits of past memories. By considering the causes of the hatred and racism, taken from prior events such as WWI and the Treaty of Versailles, the world was able to make significant progress in its endeavor to keep the peace. It took careful effort to ensure that the mistakes committed in their past memories were never to committed again, allowing the world to truly evolve. These efforts were clearly rewarding, as no major problems have arisen since then, due to the work of the UN and other peacekeeping global organizations. Therefore, the creation of the UN and other similar organizations after WWII exemplifies the need for consideration of past memories through their significant progress in elevating the world to a higher state of peace.\n\nAfter a careful analysis of Brave New World and the creation of peace organizations after WWII, it is lucid that past memories are essential. By learning about past mistakes, current society is able to ensure that the same errors do not happen again. This allows society, and the people that make it up, to truly grow and progress. Only by learning from the past will we truly be able to create a better future.

In other words, collective efforts prevail. Although staying aloof to such problems can be practical in that people will not be saddled with extra responsibilities that others of authority can take care of, people's contribution, in any form, brings more positive results that can ameliorate their standard of living. The evidence throughout history and current society is very pervasive.\n\nTake for example China during Qing Dynasty in 19th century when scramble of China by foreign powers was prevalent. Express Cixi, the leader of that time, was incapable of dealing with foreign intervention that she caused several diplomatic friction with Britain and Japan, leading to Opium Wars and Sino-Japanese War, all in early 20th century. Because Chinese citizens were humiliated by successive defeats, they decided to overthrow Qing Dynasty for the sake of the nation through Double Tenth revolution, thus setting the stage for rapid industrialization by other apt leader, Mao Zedong. Several reforms and policies were implemented to increase China's diplomatic autonomy and rescue the impoverished nation - a consequence achieved by people taking responsibility of the nation's malaise.\n\nLook at flooding in Fiji. Flood has been wrecking havoc on Nadi, the main economic generating city. With more than 5 major floods in a decade, flood was a major concern. Due to the extensive damage done by the flood, thousands became homeless. However, despite its devastation, Fiji could not only recover swiftly, but also build resilience. One main reason for this is that virtually all the people, including those severely affected by the flood, lent helping hands to one another. The fact that people volunteered to help in spite of government doing its best demonstrates that collective efforts produce the beneficial results for the community.\n\nAfter a careful analysis of China during Qing Dynasty, and flooding in Fiji, one can see that taking responsibility is, indeed, the desirable mindset in shaping the community for the better. Without people taking such responsibilities, communities can stagnate. Contributing to solving communities' ills is the only way to prevent stagnation.\n\nI know this is horrible, terrible and bad (since I always get 8 in actual exam), but could anyone please give me critical advice? I made up stuff btw. (like for China, I know Mao Zedong didn't rise to power as soon as the Qing dynasty collapsed, but...

Plan and write an essay in which you develop your point of view on this issue. Support your position with reasoning and examples taken from your reading, studies, experience, or observations.\n\nEssay:\nIndividualism is a lifestyle that keeps individuals connected to the community rather than making one forget the community. Famed people in history show how individual accomplishment keeps one connected to the community.\nMarissa Meyer, the current CEO of Yahoo is an example of individualism that results in great impact on society. Meyer, for 10 years, ever since she entered the working world with a vow of a 90 hour work week. She isolated herself from any entertainment for years and disconnected herself from the community. Her life and home was simply the google headquarters. In result, due to her work ethic she had risen through the ranks of google and eventually was hired as the CEO of yahoo in 2012. Today, she constantly creates new changes that impact the way in which hundreds of millions view their mail, communicate and are informed of the world. Her individualism, her 90 hour work weeks for 10 years led to her being even more connected with a community of millions of people. She is now even more connected and impactful then say, a person who chatted on yahoo daily, who was always connected to the community.\nBilly Beane and Pete Brand were two revolutionaries in the field of major league baseball that came to their rise primarily because of their individual  accomplishments. Beane and Brand, GM and assistant GM of the Oakland Athletics baseball team, respectively, tokened a new strategy to making teams in baseball, one called On-Base-Percentages, which was an anomalic method of choosing teams that were cheaper and players that were not as talented as other world series winners. Many memebers of the baseball community, this as threatening, unorthodox and a failure. The two were completely disconnected from the community, working completely under individualism. A few years later, the Boston Red Sox won the world series using this method, and today, teams have changed their methods of team composition to Beane and Brand's method.. A decade ago, they were seen as threats to the game, today they are viewed as revolutionaries. Once again, people's individual actions, where they had neglected the community and went for in their own action would end up being greatly connected to the community.\nEminem's career shows how individualism leads to greater connection with the community. After being found for his fame, Eminem left his wife, daughter and friends who brought him into rap and left off to Hollywood to become a successful rapper. After several years and multiple albums, Eminem reached a pinnacle, where he has come to be regarded as one of the nation's prominent rappers and a signature of the American dream. His individualism, his action to serve his self-interest, led to his fame that led to his greater connection with his many fans and the music industry rather than him being isolated and neglecting to connect with the community.\nThe life stories of many famous accomplished people, their revered fame and connection withe community through their acts of individualism displays how individualism actually causes more connection with the community, rather than causing individuals to neglect the community. For this reason, individualism is actually more popular and applauded rather than one that stays with the crowd.

I am horrible at it.\nBut does anyone thing this will be good enough? or see where I can put better wording?\n\n\n\nDear appeal board,\nThis letter is in response to my financial aid suspension. I am writing to present a request to have the privilege of receiving federal financial aid again. In the fall of 2012 I experienced a series of unfortunate events that prevented me from maintaining SAP standards. The domestic abuse in my relationship, loss of my pregnancy and my brothers potentially life threatening surgery, made it extremely difficult to keep up with attendance requirements and homework. I ended up dropping all of my classes due to the struggle I experienced with these matters.\n\nI started living with my boyfriend at the end of the 2012 summer B. It was after I moved in with him that I quickly learned how truly terrifying my situation had become. He would often keep me up late at night and constantly distract me from school work. Whenever I did try and do school work around him he would sit next to me and try to critique my work or compete with me to see who could answer the questions on my homework first. I found it incredibly stressful to attempt school work with him around. I often tried to go to the library, the ARC for tutoring or a quite place to study but he refused to let me go. He felt I didn't need extra help and I was only trying to go to the library/ARC to flirt with other male students/tutors. This was only the tip of my issues with him. We frequently fought over small things and he would kick me out of the house or lock me out of our bedroom. I spent many nights driving around in my car, crying or sleeping on the couch and this would cause me to miss school in the mornings because he would keep my phone from me and keep me up all night fighting. The relationship became physically abusive very quickly. He would push me, grab me, kick me etc. I was afraid to tell anyone or seek help. He would always threaten to kill himself if I tried leaving him. I became a slave to his every desire because if I didn't it would result in fights or physical abuse. He made it impossible to study, do homework and get extra help at school. It was also the cause of my alienation from family, friends and the general public.\n\nAlso, in the start of the 2012 fall semester, I learned that my physically disabled brother,(name here), was booked to undergo a dangerous and potentially life threatening back surgery. The surgery was to correct the curvature in his spine as a result of his constant muscle spasticity. My family knew the surgery had the potential to end his life but my brother was always in constant pain and this was his last resort for relief. Knowing that he was going to be going through this surgery I spent as much time as I could with him and my family. I found it extremely important to spend time with him and grow new memories encase the worst case scenario became a reality. The day of the surgery I stayed in the hospital for the entire 8 hours and then waited until we could visit him. He made it out of the surgery alive. The next two weeks were the next biggest hurdle, getting him off the ventilator and breathing on his own. I was always making phone calls and watching for text messages. I frequently traveled from Bradenton to All Childrens in St. Pete to visit with him and encourage him in his recovery. This traveling back and forth tremendously cut out my time for school work and classes. The emotional stress and constant worry made it hard to focus on class lectures and keeping myself engaged.\n\nThe most of heartbreaking would have had to be the loss of my pregnancy. I discovered in the middle of August that I was pregnant. This would be my first baby and I have never been sicker in my life. I threw up every morning from morning sickness. I couldn't eat, sleep, or keep fluids down. The morning time was the worst. My first class in the fall semester of 2012 began around 9am. I found that with the morning sickness, late nights fighting, and endless homework, it was just physically impossible to make it to my morning class. Resulting in me falling behind in my class work and not following attendance policies. I went to an appointment at planned parenthood in order to discuss adoption and other parental options. This is when I learned I had a \"Blighted Ovum.\" Its the gestational sack with no actual baby inside. I then agreed to proceed with an abortion of the pregnancy because I was told the pregnancy would ultimately result in a miscarriage anyways and having the abortion would end my pregnancy symptoms within two days. Sadly, a few weeks after the pregnancy I learned that I could have kept the pregnancy and waited until I was further along and had another ultrasound to be absolutely sure the pregnancy wasn't viable. The chances of the ultrasound being wrong was a possibility considering I was still very early in the pregnancy. This discovery lead to a very deep depression for me. I felt like planned parenthood misinformed me and did not tell me everything I needed to know in order to make a solid choice. I felt miserable and regretful for a very long time afterwards. I couldn't get over the fact that I may have potentially ended a good pregnancy. This, on top of everything else, really made day to day life a struggle to keep up with.\n\nAll of this, however, taught me a very valuable lesson about standing up for myself and my goals. I now have more drive and determination than ever to prove I can make myself something out of all the mess I come from.In order to maintain SAP standards, this time, I will make sure I schedule classes later in the day so mornings are not an issue. I will start off slowly. I would like to attend the summer, part time, in order to reacquaint myself with the norms of college life and studying. This time I am living at home so the chances for distraction such as relationships and other negativities are very unlikely. I dont have any distractions at this point that would cause me to run into this same situation nor do I plan on ever getting into a similar situation again. I have also taken the steps of getting on birth control so no unplanned pregnancies can be a distraction to my schooling and self progress.\n\nI do hope that it can be seen I have made a huge step in the right direction and have taken steps to prevent a repeat of fall 2012. I am surely ready to take this chance to receive federal financial aid, if given the chance and prove I am a strong, confident and ambitious young woman who is finally in a position to take the next step in life and get a serious education.  I am without a doubt sure that the steps I have planned out for myself will allow me to succeed in the coming semesters and get me right back to SAP standards. Thank you so much for your time and most importantly your consideration.\n\nSincerly,\n\nxxxxxx xxxxx xxxxx\n"}, {"date": "2014-02-21T05:22:28+00:00", "url": "http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/international-students/1618272-how-does-my-transcript-look-grade-wise.html", "messages": "\n                    My school puts your mid year exam grades and end of year examination results on your transcript if your applying to US universities.

I've neglected the essay portion of SAT for way too long and I haven't written one in a couple years.\n\nPrompt: \"The novelist John Hersey wrote, \"Learning starts with failure; the first failure is the beginning of education.\"\nWhat are your thoughts on the idea that failure is necessary for education to take place?\n\nEssay:\nFailure is a fundamental part of human nature; in fact, one could say that failure is what makes us human. However, this is not detrimental; rather, failure is pivotal to human understanding and learning.\n\nFrom the minute we are born, we constantly make mistakes. Perhaps the first mistake I made was saying \"Momo\" instead of \"Mama\". And perhaps my first teachers were my parents, who repeated to me the correct pronunciation. Attempts to demonstrate our knowledge that end up turning awry do not detract from learning; rather, they solidify our understanding when they are corrected.\n\nThe midterm I took in AP World History is a textbook example (no pun intended) of failure leading to success. Though I detested the two hundred question study guide my teacher handed out, I understood its irreplacable value. I completed the study guide and my results were abominable. Nevertheless, failing the practice exam allowed me to assess my weaknesses and straighten them out in preparation for the actual exam. A week later, the results of the actual exam were released and I was overjoyed at my 95.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that failure does not automatically lead to learning. In reality, failure is an unreliable means to an end. At the risk of sounding cliche, we are the ones responsible for ensuring we learn from our mistakes.\n\nMost people think that only death and taxes are certain, but failure should be added to this list. In spite of, or maybe even because of failure, mankind can always strive to learn and progress, even if they trip or stumble along the way.

I will try to explain as simply as possible.\n\nStudent was chosen for verification.\nStudent has never worked, has never had any income, has never filed a tax return. (common situation, of course)\n\nUpon numerous requests to the IRS for proof of non-filing, we repeatedly received a response that the request cannot be processed.\n\nNever able to request online or by phone. Faxed requests had the same result as above.\n\nWe have called the IRS numerous times over the past several months to find out what is going on.\nEvery rep at the IRS told us the same thing \"Oh, my. There is nothing here for you. There is no account for you.\" And as such, there is no way to product the forms that FAFSA verification needs.\n\nApparently this happens sometimes with people who have never had any reportable income and have never filed taxes. There is a name and social security number on file with the IRS, but no actual account associated with it and therefore no transcript requests can be processed in order to get the proof of non-filing letter or \"no record on file\" letter. The reason as per the IRS rep, is that there is no account and no address and therefore no way to validate the information on the transcript request.\n\nI had been telling the FA dept at the school what the reps were telling me, for months. They acted like I was lying, basically. They told me that \"everyone is able to get the non filing letter\" by requesting online or by fax and that there has been no student in their history who has had this issue and was unable to get the letters.\n\nIRS rep told me surely schools have experienced this before, as a lot of students are in the same situation and it does happen that there just is no account for someone until they have reportable income.\n\nSchool faxed a request to IRS for the info. They said they would submit it, that way they know i is done right - i must be doing something wrong. The result was \"request denied\" \"ask taxpayer for explanation.\"  So, FA says the IRS is not telling us why it was denied, you need to request it again. I tell them it is the reason I have been telling you for months now! Again, they just say everyone is able to get the letters ....\n\nSo, this has been holding up my FAFSA and stopping me from attending school.\n\nIronically now today I was searching the web trying to find out if anyone has experienced this or if I could find any related info and I came across this website. I was actually on hold with the IRS again, waiting for a rep while I was websearching. So, I created this account and then the rep picked up and I was on the phone with them for hours and I *THINK* the issue *might* be resolved now, as long as the school is happy with what the IRS ended up faxing me. ( I can go into to detail in another reply as to what the rep did for me ... trying to keep this post short to start.)\n\nI came back to my computer and this page was still open of course and I decided to still post and ask because this was a very aggravating experience and I am just wondering if there is anyone out there in the same situation or has had this situation in the past.\n\n\n\n\n"}, {"date": "2014-10-15T15:01:16+00:00", "url": "http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/common-application/1695844-how-to-fill-the-activities-section.html", "messages": "\n                    Almost all of my ECs are overlapping and interdependent.

My major will be political science and international relations and I'm looking to try and see if I can tack on some East-Asian/Japanese studies for a third major. I was accepted to Berkeley with a 3.03GPA and I thought that telling my story might be of some hope/insite to those of you out there who feel like you might have messed up.\n\nMy journey into college started the newest UC campus, UCMerced. It was the only UC I was accepted to, so I went there really as my only option. I didn't have any clear idea of what I wanted to do or even what I myself liked, but I figured I liked going on the internet a lot, so I must like computer, therefor I should do computer science...and that was before I knew there was math envolved (I failed pre-calc in high school). Needless to say, I did very poorly my first year. I ended up with 2 Fs, 2 Ds and a slew of Cs and only one A, which was in my writing class. At that same time, I started studying Japanese randomly for no real particular reason on my free time (I will go into that later). By the end of my tenure at UCMerced, I had a 2.04GPA and was teetering on academic probation, so I withdrew from the campus while I was in good-standing.\n\nAs I said, I started studying Japanese in my free time. As luck or fate or whatever you want to call it, the community college near UCMerced has one of the largest outreach programs for Japanese students studying abroad. I was able to make a lot of friends and instead of going home, I remained in Merced and attended the community college. With the large number of Japanese students, I was able to be constantly surrounded by not just Japanese students, but also businessmen and educators from Japan. I made sure to talk with these people on a daily basis and get to know them.\n\nBy the time I had one semester at the college under my belt, I had actually gotten to the point where I was reading Japanese newspapers and watching the news and pretty much enjoying Japanese the same way I would enjoy anything in English (while looking up words in the dictionary of course). So I figured I should plan a trip to Japan. And while I was at it, I thought I may as well apply to some Japanese universities. I figured I had a horrible chance of getting into any respectable American school, so it might actually be a good idea to try some over there. So in the summer of 2010, I went to Tokyo and took university tests. I paid for the trip by being stingy and finding odd jobs to do with the Japanese businessmen (thus reinforcing my Japanese).\n\nSo after I came back from Japan, I started my 3rd semester in my college back at Merced. The tests I took in Japan in the summer were only a first set of tests and I actually needed to go back to Japan, right before finals week, to take more tests and sit for interviews. I made sure from the start of the semester to work hard and get to know my professors, that way they would be fine with letting me go to Japan for 2 weeks right before finals.\n\nWhile all of that was going on, I was of course in the process of writing my UC applications. My testing in Japan went from Nov 20-Dec 3. So if my memory serves me right, I actually turned my UC essays in while I was in Tokyo (weird). But this also meant that I would be applying to the UC schools with no real knowledge of if I was accepted to the universities in Japan or not, so that information was never able to make it to my essays. All I could hope for was that they saw improvement in my grades and that I took an interesting summer trip.\n\nSo, I got back to Merced from my winter Japan trip and took my finals then waited for the results from the Japanese schools. I ended up being accepted (for anyone interested, the schools were Keio and Waseda). Perhaps the most important thing that I did though while in Japan was go and talk with Japanese professors and get to know them as well (I will explain why later).\n\nAs it would turn out, Japanese schools don't take transfer units, so going there would have meant starting back from square one and of course it would mean going into a large debt. These are all things I knew before squandering thousands of dollars just to take tests and they were things I thought I wouldn't mind. But when faced with the very real decision of less secure schools and more debt and more time, I opted to stay in America.\n\nNow to fast forward to the recent future. My spring break was filled with 2 events, none of which made me happy. One was my acceptance to UCDavis. Not a bad school, my sister went there, but they happened to have some of the lowest transfer GPA requirements (2.9+), so I felt as though it was more of a consolation than something that I had worked for. Then came the news from UCLA. I was rejected. This is actually something I was expecting in all honesty. I didn't expect them to really sift through the some 50,000+ essays and find mine in the middle of all of that and take it in. So with UCLA saying \"no,\" I was certain UCBerkeley would be out of the question. The day I got rejected by UCLA, I wrote up my appeal letters for UCLA and Berkeley, emailed the professors in Japan to write appeal letters for me and was completely ready to barge through the admission offices and demand that they take a better look at my application.\n\nBut today, I found out that I don't have to do that. I got accepted.\n\nIf there is really anything that I learned from this and anything that I'd like other people to get out of are really two things: do what you enjoy and make connections. When I say do something you enjoy, I really mean do something that you absolutely love, something you can't stop doing, something that you truly could not see yourself without. It really shows in a person when they have chosen a path that is not suited to them, which is what happened to me. But that all changed the moment that I committed myself to something I really believed in passionately. Next is the part about connections. Connections can get you jobs, they can get you letters of recommendation, and they can be the start of some really meaningful relationships.\n\nOn a side note and somewhat related to the connections, I have also applied to Stanford. This time I will have essays detailing everything that I did and letters of recommendation from the professors I made sure to talk with daily while in Japan. And I'll let you all know how that turns out.\n\nSo yeah, basically, to anyone who has hit any bumps in the road, just keep on working towards those things you can get excited about and I am sure something good will come your way :D\n\nGood luck!\n\n\nPS: For anyone interested in my course load and grades, here is a simple list of those:\n[Freshman] - UCMerced\nFirst Semester (16 units): A, B, C, D\nSecond Semester (15 units): A, C, C, F and a W\nGPA: 2.25\n[2nd Year] - JC\nFirst Semester (12 units): A, A, A, A\nSecond Semester (13 units): A, A, A, B\n[3rd Year] - JC\nFirst Semester (15 units): A, A, A, B\nSecond Semester (7 units): A, A, A\nJC GPA: 3.85\nCumulative GPA: 3.03\n\nIn terms of clubs, I just did two:\nPTK (honors society): VP and treasurer. This is highly recommended for all transfer students. Great way to surround yourself with likeminded, hardworking students.\nInternational Club: VP. This is the one I was actually passionate about.\n\nNotes: I had to take a really light course load at my current college because I was close to having over 80 units. If you go over 80 units before transferring, it tends to automatically disqualify you for going to UCs. But I also had to spread classes out of two years to make sure I could do all of my Japanese school stuff at the same time.

My mother did not allow me to study for the 10th grade SAT, as she was treating it like a PSAT but with actual writing. I also have chronic sinus issues, and had a nasty sinus infection on test day. I didn't double check anything, finished most sections quickly (I normally finish before time but take time to check) and actually took catnaps between when I finished and when time was called. Needless to say I didn't do so hot. 590 CR, 520 M, and 490 writing, 1600 total. I only need CR+M together, and I need a score of at least 1290, right now I have 1110. I really want to stress I NEED this, it's for Bright Futures, which is basically the easiest FL res. scholarship, but since I'm legally classified as a homeschool student I have to make that score as opposed to a slightly lower one (If I go for the lower one I have to prove my transcripts, which won't work, as I'll explain soon)\nI did FLVS (FL virtual school) for HS because I wanted to dual enroll full time starting junior year, and I did. I have 4 college classes, and one AP. The college ones are fairly manageable, just lots of reading, and one professor who is seriously under qualified, but I'm managing. The AP is online, and has a fair amount of busywork, but is also manageable. This is all great, and since I do FLVS and dual enrollment, I'd have no issue proving transcripts (providing them from an actual institution), except I literally can not. One example is English, I did Eng I, II, and then AP Eng Lang, and whenever I only got a 3 on the Eng Lang test I went to the college I am now dual enrolled at and CLEPed it so I would get out of comp I and II. This means that unless I want to force myself to take English IIII or another AP Eng course I don't need, I pretty much need this score. The same can be said for math, and science (I CLEPed a few different things over the summer, and those don't count towards the transcripts that bright futures wants)\nAs I said, my classes are fairly manageable what is not manageable was I didn't study until the 22nd for the SAT (I was going to start the 14/15th, right after my ACT, but hurrah! I was sick for that, too, and I took a week to get back to the point where I could actually focus again). I'm signed up for the SAT on the 11th, and have been doing 4 hours or so of studying per day, except Tuesday's, (T/R Classes and required volunteer hours Tues. night prevent that from happening). I guess this post was really unorganized but basically I have a few main questions:\n1) If my baseline, no studying, being sick, is 1600 total, 1110 for CR/M, do you think I could get a fairly nice total and at least 1290 CR/M? Have you seen something like that before?\n2) How do I handle studying with 4 college classes, 1 AP class, and the fact that I still need some personal time (I've literally started breaking down in the middle of studying from how stressful all of this courseload feels)\n3) Any tips for taking the test while sick? I've been to the ENT multiple times and taken many many doses of antibiotics, and actually just had a CT scan today/blood work done, but the results/solution will not be back until after the test.\n\nI know SAT/ACT are very different, but my ACT score with a month of studying and slight sickness was 28 (needed a 29), went for a retake, totally awful infection just like the first SAT, crammed the week before but still had that base from the first test, got a 27, superscored it's still a 28 but I raised the math subscore by 2 points.\nJust for reference my (good) ACT subscores were:\nReading- 33\nMath- 25\nEnglish- 29\nScience-25\nI know there's no science on the SAT, but do you think those ACT scores I got while I was feeling better may reflect on how I'll do on the SAT with studying/a healthy mind?\nI'm honestly just very stressed over this upcoming test and don't know how to deal with it or what I can do to make it better (it being the stress and the score)                "}, {"date": "2013-12-24T12:27:59+00:00", "url": "http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/financial-aid-scholarships/1595418-do-you-think-my-financial-aid-appeal-letter-wouldbe-accepted-any-advice.html", "messages": "\n                    THEIR ARE TWO SCHOOLS. ONE OF THEIR NAMES ARE THERE THE OTHER IAM GOING TO LEAVE \"BLANK\n\nTo Whom This May Concern:\n\nMy name is (JOHN DOE) and I am writing this letter regarding falling below the 67 percent course completion requirement at Miami Dade Community college. The class in question was Reading 2 (Rea0017-Fall 2012) with [teacher name] and Developmental Math C (MAT0022C-Spring2013)..[with teacher name]. I would like to begin by thanking you in advance for taking the time to read this letter and to consider my request for Financial Aid reinstatement at [Name]Community College. With My family and I having to go threw A tremendous hardship and me not finding a Math tutor when i desperately needed one, my completion rate suffered as a result. I don't mean to make excuses for my poor academic performance, but I would like to explain the circumstances.\n\nOver the course of my first year, I had a difficult time studying as a Freshmen , and taking care of my mom while she's been recovering from her back injury on the job on May 4, 2011. Diagnosed as Hernaited Disc, For 2 years my mom has suffered from severe Lower back pain and/or pain in the buttock, and leg pains after falling off of a ladder on her job at [Business Name]. After being terminated my mom could not handle the thought of losing job, as well as her house and car too, so she became very depressed.  As months past my mom just couldn't not take it any more so we decided to sign my mom up for New Horizon Community Mental Health Center of a request from a friend on May 15, 2012. Later we found out my problem was not only Depression but also Anxiety. Suffering from Depression and Anxiety my mom was being treated with medications. While her depression and anxiety became controlled by the medications i decided to attend school in the Fall Semester of 2012.  With my brother working and my mom not having any recurrence of anxiey or depression I was able to study and complete class assignments with a overall gpa of a 3.4 .\n\nIn October of 2012 my mom was given a different medication. Told  by New Horizons Community Health Center Physiatrist Dr.[name] that they would change her medication every 3 months in attempt to figuring out what medicine controls her disorder more efficiently. In result of that,  the new medication would not work to the standards of her needs.  So around September of 2012 my mom medication seemed to be not helping her sleep at nights or control her Depression and Anxiety. After explaining it to New Horizons Mental Health Center and requesting that her medications be changed, the requets took 10 days. While on hold my mom had two panic attacks . On September 14th of 2012 which i believe was her fisrt week on the new medication, my mom experienced a panic attack while home alone. With my mom feeling anxiety or scared in unthreating situations and also missing her doctors Appointments i felt scared for my mother and wanted to help. With my brother early morning schedule at his job he was unable to watch my mom so i decided to drop my REA0017 Class in effort to take care of my mom.\n\nIn spring of 2013 i decided to enroll in school again at Miami Dade College due to the fact that my mom was started to recover. In Spring I registerd for REA0017 again and passed. In Development Math C (MAT0022C) i was having a hard time understand the teachers accent so i couldn't really understand his lecturing but i was really trying to put effort in to passing his class. At first the class work and homework was  easy to complete due to the fact that i knew the material,  but when things started to progress in class the material became harder and his lecturing didn't become any easier. In result of that i felt that i needed to withdraw from that class. I intend to register and repeat the coursework that i failed for that class and will also be getting a math tutor for each math course I will be taking through out school.\n\nI take full responsibility for my unsatisfactory completion rate. The actual academic portion of college has never been a problem for me. I maintain a 3.4 GPA and will continue to improve it along with my completion rate. Since October of 2013 With rehabilitation, stretching daily, and chiropractic treatment my mom now is recovering  pretty well  and can almost live a normally active life again. With my brother also living home my mom has some one else to watch over here while im gone. Also with my mom new Therapist she's now starting to lay off the medications and is doing fine off her medications except for a few. In the spring semester of 2014 i would not only be able to focus on school without any at home distractions, I would also be able to excel in math with the individualized tutoring i would be signing up for offered through the Academic Resource Center  as soon as I register for class. With this new start in [name] Community College I do feel that i could accompolish my goals and get the help that i need with the benefits of this college.With This new small class environment it will give me a much greater opportunity in getting to know my profesors, participate in discussion, and have Hands-on learning opportunities.

(CS 61A,61B,61C,70 and Math 1A,1B,54)\n\nAfter reading various comments on College Confidential, I've been led to think that at least some of these prerequisites are incredibly difficult weeder classes with a curved grading that results in less than half the students getting a B. Some posts had stories of classes having less than a 50% passing rate, even! One poster (bsd) said that some CS classes require 30 hours a week of studying, for just one class! I can't imagine how any non-godlike student could manage to get a B or greater in all of their classes if they had to study an average of 60 hours per week all semester.\n\nIs it true that less than half of intended CS students actually end up being able to even enroll in CS as a major? If so, why do these students not instead enroll in a school that they'll have a much greater chance of actually graduating?\n\nI'm a CC Freshmen (older adult - dropped out of a good tech school due to illness many years ago) trying to plan my course-load appropriately for Computer Science prerequisites for a UC transfer.

From what I read from some of the posts here though, Berkeley sounds like it would be 100x more difficult.\n\nSorry for the long rambling post.

However, \u00a0how far do we know to always follow our own impulses? \u00a0No one is absolutely erudite, still experts and older people who experienced more than we did and devoted their lives for knowledge and teaching can always benefit us from their experiences. Eventhough in taking decisions there's nothing totally right or totally wrong and it depends on what suits a person more, we can also clasp from experts what can benefit us. A female young scientist's ignorance for her colleague professional scientists and also my personal experience of not listening to my mentor's tips led to deteriorating results.\u00a0\n\nThe female scientists wanted to genetically engineer three mako sharks to increase their brain capacity so that they can harvest a tissue that could be a cure for Al-zahaimer disease. Unfortunately, their increased brain capacity also made them more aggressive, stronger, and smarter that they even swam backwards. As a result, what the colleagues warned from actually happened! Worse, during a rescue mission in a severe storm, one mako shark pulled the helicopter's cable and dragged it to a towel, contributing to a massive explosion in the area. Regreting and deplored over the consequences, the scientist realized that she could have atleast listen to the experts warnings and reiterate over the project.\n\nLike the scientist, I didn't exactly listen to my teacher's instructions in the way to solve my academic test correctly and get a higher score. Simply following my own way of solving, which is wrong, one the test day, I was perplexed and I couldn't even understand the questions or manage the paper's time. Consequently, my grades disperated me and then I realized that I should follow my teacher's instructions for the next test. When I did so, I really started improving and I'm now optimistic to the next test's results.\u00a0\nIn conclusion, people must first listen to others who know more and who advice us only for our own good and the society's, like my teacher and expert scientists.

I usually score mid-advanced on STAR tests, and last year, as a junior, I was enrolled in AP English Language (and APUSH, and AP Chemistry).\n\nAs a junior, I was given the CSU/CC English readiness examination. Basically, this exam assessed my grip on the English language in an effort to tell me whether or not I'd be able to handle English 101 at my local CC.\n\nI thought that the exam was pretty easy. It had questions like, \"which word would best fit in this sentence?\" and the right (?) answers usually stood out.\n\nI got my results today, and it turns out that I failed it, making me \"ineligible for credit-freshman English at participating CCs and CSUs.\" I've never been a particularly good test taker; for example, since freshman year, my SAT has stayed at the same +/-100 range (1700s); but could that really be the reason that I failed it?\n\nMost of the students in my grade passed it! In my group of friends (who aren't enrolled in H/AP English, or any other APs), everyone passed. I don't think that it's a problem that I failed it, since I passed the AP English Language exam, but can there be something that is fundamentally wrong with the way I write? My writing abilities have always been praised by my teachers, but could it be that it was merely a \"pity praise\"? The kind of applaud that you give your dog for sitting on command?\n\nI just have this weird, ominous feeling about this exam. Could it be a fluke? Or could it actually point to a real problem in my style of writing, reading, and comprehension of written texts? Ostensibly, I'm not fit to sit in a CC English class (even though many of my CC friends, who can't write for their lives, are)... but could it be wrong? When I first received my SAT results, I thought of getting it rechecked (because my GPA is pretty high, and I had scored a 2,200 on an at home practice test), but now it seems like I'm just a bad writer (or a bad test writer?).\n\nSo, what do you guys think about this whole readiness exam? Could it be wrong? I am eligible to take English 101 at my local CC due to my AP English Language test result, and I have already gotten credit, so what am I missing?\n\nBy the way, I thought that the readiness assessment was much, much easier than the AP test.

I had a low-decent GPA (3.3, a bit higher for my major). I didn't do great in HS (3.1 without any challenging coursework), so I went to a different state university for two years before transferring to UW. Regardless, I was usually considered by my teachers and professors as one of the smarter students. I've always felt like I badly underachieved, but also been aware of the inflated confidence of my generation, and the possibility of this within myself as a defense against massive insecurities I had. Regardless, there could have been legitimate reasons for my relatively just-above-mediocre academic performance such as growing up in a really ****ed up family dynamic that did not offer much helpful conditioning, as well as having my childhood largely structured around hospital visits and other serious health issues. Basically, just trauma. Anyway, I won't make this therapy.\n\nIn my late 20's now I feel like my brain is actually reverse-engineering itself back to like, the starting point, when thinking first slammed it's creative foot onto the external world and started telling stories and ultimately structuring the most basic energies and ideas through which I'd experience reality. This is changing everything. I don't necessarily know whether I'm smart enough for engineering, but my girlfriend (who was a math major at Stanford) seems to think I definitely am. I generally err to the side of caution with praise, but something in me tells me I should take on a challenge like engineering. As I see it, this would be beneficial in two ways: It would provide my with satisfaction from having a job requiring brainpower and applied understanding of abstract things, and it would also put me in a more secure place jobs-wise in a world which seems to becoming more competitive and more demanding of actual skills.\n\nI do believe my interests lie in this type of field. I remember in second grade discovering what an atom was and feeling like a knot of energy in my chest had been untangled. I remember feeling this sense of relief and fascination, and sitting on my back porch and looking at the night sky. I'd tell my parents and friends about it, and no one seemed to share my level of excitement. But this is a relatively basic feeling and memory to use as a basis for diving into a multi-year and expensive pursuit. I'm a bit worried that, feeling my own desires or even preferences for the first time, it will take years for me to actually develop enough of a healthy and grounded enough self-interest to take the challenge on and be able to follow it through and complete it. Part of it is an ego thing, too, as my parents treated me as being kind of \"stupid,\" because I had a health condition that is sometimes associated with serious learning disabilities.\n\nI don't feel like I've asked a definite question, but I'd be really interested in hearing more about your experiences with engineering, or anything else you feel might be helpful. Given my situation, do you have any recommendations about how I could discover more about what a job as an engineering major is like? Whether I'm just fancying some shallow idea in my head that will result in either quickly discovering I've gotten into something I hate, or simply burning out and wasting money? Electrical Engineering is what jumps out as being the most interesting to me. Do most engineers end up in somewhat repetitive, corporate-feeling jobs? Is it naive of me to expect I could end up in a somewhat unstructured, creative environment with people who share a genuine fascination with the universe and technology rather than just with money and status?\n\nAnyway, I apologize if this post is stupid and appreciate anything.

Unfortunately, none of the posts I've looked at seem to really fit my situation. Also, this is going to be kind of long so get comfortable.\n\nThis current Fall semester I was supposed to go on a study abroad trip to France (I was a French major at the time, but have since switched to a different major in the past several months). I got my aid in early August, which was around $11k (they disbursed ALL the funds to me since I would have the pay the French university directly), and then paid for my plane ticket, pre-paid some of my bills for the duration that I'd be gone, as well as anything else that I needed to pay for. So before I even left about 1/3 if not almost half of the money was already spent.\n\nSo, I arrive in France. I've been to France before, hell I've been to 13 countries. I love traveling and I France, this should be fine, it should be fun. Well, actually, no. It's not. I completely freak out with full on black out panic attacks which I've never had, or had anything close to that in my life since I'm a pretty mellow, level-headed person. I'm not able to function, I'm in physical pain, and am in no shape to to be able to attend classes in a completely foreign language. So I decided the best thing for me to do was leave. There were other contributing factors as to why I left, and why I was having panic attacks, but that's the basic story as to how I came to be in the mess that I am currently in. The rest is personal, and not relevant to what my current situation is.\n\nI get back home and immediately work on trying to drop from the semester as it was already about 3+ weeks into the semester at home and I wouldn't have been able to sign up for normal classes. I speak with my advisers and the financial aid office trying to figure out what I needed to do. I successfully drop from the semester, and was told that I would need to pay back some of my loan. Keyword: SOME. The advisers that I spoke to at financial aid said I would probably not have to pay back the full amount and there would be options for repaying what I owed. Considering I had already spent a good deal of the money before I left, and then more in order to change my flights and get back home I was okay with paying a partial amount of the loan.\n\nAt this point it was just a waiting game to see what information the school got back to me with regarding what I owed. I think it was a month and a half later when I checked my student site (where I add/drop classes, check on my loans, etc.) as I had been doing every day just in case that I find that I have a past due balance of around $11k, the full amount of my loans. I didn't get a call or an e-mail about it, and may not have known about it if I wasn't checking that page religiously. But you know, whatever. It was there, I knew about it then, so fine, let's just move on.\n\nI went ahead and paid what I could, $1500 with the money I had left (I had to pay my bills as well contribute some of the money to my family during those months) and called the financial aid office to see what was up. They said that I owed the full amount, that they didn't know why the person I spoke to before told me I wouldn't have to pay the full amount, and that there were no payment options they could offer in order to pay it off. They also told me that until it was paid off I wouldn't be able to attend anymore classes, and if I didn't pay it off by Jan 15 that it would be sent to collections. Well, that really friggin' sucks. But it is what it is, and I just have to do what needs to be done.\n\nNow, ever since I've gotten back home I've been looking for a job as I knew I had to pay back the loan as well as pay all my other bills. Sending out about 10-15 applications a day on craigslist, monster, and applying to jobs directly on their websites. I had maybe two interviews between the time I started applying (late August) until about late November when I got hired for a seasonal part time job at a store in the mall paying $8.50 an hour working roughly 18-20 hours a week. Doing the math on that, I wont be able to pay off the $9K+ loan for well over a year. I still haven't been able to find a 2nd, let alone a 3rd job to make extra money.\n\nTo top it all off, I found out last week that the one job I do have is going to be closing for remodeling and wont be opening again until April, thus resulting in everyone at the store getting laid off. So I'm back at square one, and that's where I'm at right now.\n\nThere are also some other things I should add to help clarify my situation, since I know there will be some people who will answer with suggestions that may not be possible for me, or I've already tried them.\n\nI already live with my parents, who are both unemployed. My mother is on disability and we all (my mom, dad, my two bothers and myself) live off her social security checks. My dad is a full time student, so his financial aid helps supplement our monthly income. They both have terrible credit.\n\nI, too, have terrible credit. So there's no hope in me getting a loan from a bank even with my parents as co-signers.\n\nAs I've already said before, I'm already looking for work. For Any work. I'm this close to selling my body on e-bay. So trust me, I'm working my butt off to get jobs to pay this loan off.\n\nI have already been to and have graduated from Community College with an AA.\n\nNormally with financial aid my school is entirely affordable. Each semester is somewhere between $4-$5k, and I get about $10-$11k each semester. So it's not a case where I'm going to a school that is, I guess you could say, above my means. It's the cheapest 4 year school in my area. As long as I'm in school receiving financial aid I'm able to live off my refund and pay all my bills with no problems.\n\nI've exhausted all my options in regards to speaking to my academic and financial aid advisers. My school isn't the best when it comes to giving students straight answers, and will Always give me the run around. Their website isn't much help either.\n\nThe past due amount that I owe isn't for my actual loans with Sallie Mae, which I've already had to start paying back as my 6 month grace period is up. It's with my actual school, since they paid the lender back so I subsequently have to pay the school back.\n\nMost importantly, Yes I know I got into this mess all on my own. I know I have to pay my loans back, I knew that when I registered for school.  I know these are grown up problems and I have to be a big girl and deal with it. Trust me, I know all that, and I'm working my ass off trying to sort it all out. If I have to work for the next 3 years, or even the next 15 years to pay off the loan in order to get back into school I will. I wish and hope there's a way I can get back into school sooner, but I know realistically that's not going to be the case. So please hold back a bit when you're scolding me, 'cause I do know all these things and I feel pretty damn guilty already.\n\nSo after All that back story, my questions to you guys are:\n\nWhat can I expect to happen after my loan goes to collections? 'Cause it will, I have no chance of being able to pay it off before the due date. What will the payments be like, and what kind of options, if any, do I have for payments?\n\nWhen can I expect to be able to re-enroll in classes again? Will it have to be after the past due balance is completely paid off, or is there a chance I can register after I've paid off a portion of it?\n\nHow does going to collections affect my SAP and my eligibility for Financial Aid in the future?\n\nAny kind of help or information you guys can give me would be immensely helpful. I'm really at a loss as to what's going to happen, or what I can do. All I know I CAN do is get a job, or multiple jobs in order to pay off the loan. So I would be so grateful with any kind of information you guys can give me.\n\nThanks.

This leads me to a question...\n\nHas anyone ever seen data on the percentile spreads by grade level (or geography for that matter)?  Seems like the data for this exists and has been gathered for some time.  It may not ever have been published.  For example, if rising 8th grader A gets a raw quant score of 45 and rising 10th grader B gets the same raw score, has anyone seen any actual data around what the resulting difference between percentiles tends to be?  I know this would vary test to test by actual population, but am more curious if there is any generalized sense of the range of the adjustment - e.g. each grade lower tends to be about a 5% or 10% percentile uptick at the same raw score.\n\nI suppose someone with kids in two different grades who took the same test might have some idea of the relative impact.

You should make time to do as many practice exams as you possibly can and to do practice problems as you are doing your content review. For the MCAT, you need to become comfortable with the testing format, the types of questions, and the manner in which concepts and information is tested. Being familiar with these aspects of the exam can only come through long and thorough practice of MCAT material. If you are diligent and really put forth maximal effort into practicing the material, you will start to gain an intuition about MCAT questions, and how to approach them. Accordingly, the number one mistake made by MCAT studiers is to only review the material in great depth, and to neglect actually taking timed, full-length practice MCAT exams. In fact, you must do both.\n\nPS:\nUnderstanding Concepts and Developing an Intuition \u0096 The best way to approach this section is to be extremely curious about the concepts presented. When you are reviewing a particular concept you should constantly be asking yourself \u0093WHY?\u0094 Doing so will refocus your thought process from one of memorization to one of understanding. In fact, you must understand why all of the equations are the way they are, and why they make logical sense. One way to facilitate this process is to try and work through what you think should happen without worrying about the numbers at first. Often, students have memorized an equation and will just settle for plugging values into an equation in order to try and arrive at an answer. Unfortunately, this process often bogs the student down in number crunching at the expense of understanding what is actually going on. The latter is extremely important for the MCAT.\nThus, when you are doing physics and chemistry problems, the first thing you should do is think about the general result you would expect from the situation given. Only when you have understood what should happen conceptually, should you begin number crunching. For instance, if you are dealing with an acid base buffer problem and the question asks, \u0093What will the pH be after I add X amount of Y substance?\u0094, the first thing you should do is ask yourself, \u0093Would I expect the pH to increase a little or a lot, stay the same, or decrease a little or a lot?\u0094 Once you think through the concepts, you\u0092ll be more confident in your numerical answer as well as have an understanding of why your numerical answer is correct. After all, the MCAT is a thinking test. If you do not understand the concepts you simply will not be able to confidently answer a fair number of problems on the real exam. That being said, even though I have stressed the importance of concepts, you still must also know all of the relevant equations, and be comfortable with manipulating those equations. Both concept understanding and skill in formula manipulation are necessary for success on the MCAT PS.\n\nAdditional Note: When we say we are doing \"Content Review\" in terms of PS, this includes doing practice problems along with your content review to absorb the material. For physics and chemistry, an integral part of learning to understand the material is to work through problems to make the logical process more concrete in your mind. Thus, do sectional tests, practice problems and practice passage (but not timed, full lengths!) when studying.\n\nLearning to be Highly Proficient with Simple Math \u0096 This is a point that is grossly overlooked both by students themselves and test prep companies. In my opinion, the most important factor that separates the average speed test taker from one who can finish the PS section with 10-20mins remaining is the ease at which the latter uses estimation methods, tricks with formula manipulation, and answer elimination techniques to reduce the amount of scratch work necessary to complete a problem. On my real exam, I used no more than \u00bc a single-sided page for scratch work on the PS. Because I was intensely comfortable with order of magnitude estimation, decimal estimation, log estimation, dimensional analysis and conceptual knowledge I could eliminate answer without too much written math. Sure, you could use the formulas to explicitly solve each problem, but using estimation along with formula manipulation will save you whole minutes on the real exam. In previous posts I have highlighted one example of this:\nEstimation trick for pH and log calculations\n\nIn addition, you must be completely comfortable with orders of magnitude estimation. You should be able to figure out just from estimation what the order of magnitude of the answer should be. This will aid you in eliminating one or two answers right away. One way to start to get good at this is to treat every number in scientific notation:\nIf X = n x 10^-4 and Y = p x 10^8, then Y/X = (p/n)x 10^(8 + 4).\nYou must be completely fluent in order of magnitude manipulation like this. Definitely practice it.\n\nYou should also become familiar with estimating the decimal values of weird looking fractions and the fractional values of weird looking decimals. For instance, .3145/.6021 might look difficult, but it\u0092s approximately = \u00bd. This kind of estimation is usually sufficient for the MCAT, and GREATLY simplifies the manipulation of formulas and numerical calculations.\n\nDimensional Analysis \u0096 Using the units of physical quantities to your advantage is also often grossly overlooked by students. One way to check your math is to manipulate the units of the quantities you are using while you are manipulating the math.\nThe following post sufficiently explains one very MCAT relevant way of how you should be able to use dimensional analysis on the PS section of the MCAT:\nAn example of how dimensional analysis can really save you one the MCAT.\n\nAn additional way dimensional analysis can be helpful is if you forget the formula for something. Let\u0092s say that you forgot that one of the formulas for electric potential (Volts) is Volts = Electric field * distance. Let\u0092s say that you know that Voltage is expressed in Joules/Coulomb and Electric field is Newtons/Coulomb. Then, you remember that Work (Joules) = Force (Newtons) * Distance (meters). Therefore, if I multiply Newtons/Coulomb * Distance I get Joules/Coulomb, which is the correct units for electric potential. Usually, this trick will lead you to the right answer!\nA word of warning, however, about this last point: Sometimes there will be an extra constant factor needed to arrive at the correct answer. Therefore, only use this technique when you really forget the correct formula and be wary for extra constants! Example:\nLet\u0092s say that you know the units of energy are [E] ~ kgm^2/s^2. Knowing that, it would be reasonable to guess that one correct formula for energy would be E = mass*velocity^2. Afterall, mass*velocity^2 has the correct units\u0085but because of how the formula for energy was derived, energy, as you know, is actually = \u00bd mass*velocity^2.\nSo while this particular trick with dimensional analysis can be useful, you must not rely on it.\n\n"}, {"date": "2006-08-06T08:41:58+00:00", "url": "http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/engineering-majors/222845-avoid-bioengineering-if-you-can.html", "messages": "\n                    I am a 4th year bioengineering major at UC Berkeley and I've long realized that I've made a terrible mistake. I really don't see how BioE should be as \"hot\" a major as it is. The program at Berkeley, given its admission statistics, is highly overrated. In terms of career prospects and earning potential, there is no added advantage to majoring in BioE. Here's my take on why it is a bad idea to major in BioE (with exceptions, below):\n\nBioE is too broad and theoretical at the undergraduate level to be useful as a terminal degree. Companies in the relevant field hiring newly graduated bachelors are looking for people who have more specialized skill sets so they can be part of a interdisciplinary team. As a result, they will prefer the mechanical engineer, the chemical engineer, the materials scientist, or the electrical engineer (and put them all on the same team to complement each other) over the bioengineer (who knows a little bit of all the fields but is not good at any one of them). Alumni of Berkeley's BioE program have told me that there arent many jobs specifically available for BioE bachelors and they have found the need to compete with graduates of other engineering disciplines for jobs. (The BioE major trying to show employers that he can be better at chemical engineering than the ChemE major is already at a disadvantage.)\n\nOf course, there are exceptions. For example, top rated BME programs at Johns Hopkins, Duke, and UCSD literally force their students to select another engineering field in which to specialize and offer few choices in actual course selection. Consequently, these are all ABET accredited. The BioE program (which is not ABET accredited) is poorly designed: you can get away by taking half your core in integrative biology department. If not, the result is still a mish-mash of wholly unrelated courses in various sciences and engineering. What I am hearing from people in the job search is that when employers ask them if they have experience in a certain field, they can say \"I took a class and we covered this\", but they can't really say they know or understand it. (Keep in mind that what is true for Berkeley is not true for a number of places, but it can still be representative for many emerging programs.)\n\nOn the other hand, it is worth getting PhD in bioengineering to get into the industry, but PhD programs take anyone who has majored in a science or engineering discipline. And here, BioE majors are still at no advantage, especially if they haven't done any substantial research.\n\nSo my advice to all of you early in the game:\n-Major in BioE only if you truly love and enjoy the subject. This is true for any major.\n-If you are premed, you must not only love and enjoy the subject but be good at it since your GPA will matter a gazillion (literally!) times over your major. The same holds the same if you are prelaw, but you will better off as a patent lawyer having majored in something more specialized at the undergraduate level like EE.\n-If you want to enter a BioE-related field, then you do not need to major in BioE: try choosing another engineering discipline (e.g. EE to work on BioMEMS, MechE to work in orthopedic biomechanics). This will make it easier on you both when you are trying to find a job with a bachelor's degree and when you are trying to get into a PhD BioE program.\n-If you do major in BioE, try to take classes in a single engineering discipline (or double major!) to make yourself more marketable to employers.\n\nKeep in mind that what I learned firsthand I experienced in school. The rest I learned talking to other people. Feel free to validate these opinions or disagree with them.

Man is free to write the script for his own life: He can blame no one else if his life is a poor performance.\n-Adapted from Jean Paul Sartre\n\nThe expectations and restraints of society severely limit a person: Schooling, organized religion, and other social institutions imprison a person's mind and spirit.\n-Adapted from William Blake.\n\nAssignment: Are we free to make our own choices in life, or are our decisions always limited by the rules of society?\n\nI believe that as sentient, autonomous individuals, we are capable of making our own choices in life. However, the choices that we are capable of making often differ from the choices that we actually make, because of the influences of society. Our choices sometimes are not entirely autonomous because they are shaped by existing judicial, and social institutions.\n\nWe are capable of doing anything we wish, but some choices carry negative repercussions which are brought forth by the judicial system. As a result, we are implicitly discouraged from making certain choices. The Attorney General's Chambers in the US prosecutes individuals who made decisions that violated the Penal Code of the name. Because the Prosecution carries punishments to those who commit acts which infringe upon the rights of others, we are discouraged from committing certain acts like theft and murder. Therefore, a person may be perfectly capable of killing some else, but he or she is not free to do so because of the judicial system.\n\nAs with the judicial system, the caste system of India also shows how our choices may be predetermined by an external agent. In India in the past, children born into different castes were entitled to different choices and opportunities. As a result, a child born into the highest caste (the 'Priests') was entitled to the privilege of making more choices than a child born into the lowest cast (the 'Untouchables'). While those born into the highest caste have the choice of deciding what schools to go to or what to eat for lunch, those from the lowest castes are deprived of the opportunities to make such choices. Thus, the accident of birth prevents people from making some choices depending on the circumstances into which they are born.\n\nIn conclusion, even though we are equipped with the abilities to make independent choices, we are prevented from doing so because of the judicial system and social institutions.

Still, I think the most enjoyable and educating part of my life was participation in various entrepreneurship, startup events and hackathons. All of which helped to define me and focus the direction of my future studies and motivated me to select Physics and Computer Sciences as my majors.\n\nHowever, factors such as distance from home and being alone in a new place scared me from taking the steps needed to make my dream come true. All of that changed in 2012 when in \u0093Silicon Valley Comes to the Baltics conference\u0094 I heard a speech by Gigi Wang a board member from MIT/Stanford Venture Lab.\n\nIn her speech, Wang discussed the importance of sharing ideas between businesses and establishing your own companies. She noted that in order be successful, people have to leave their comfort zones and do something they are not used to doing. Wang said that when she had been younger she had asked her mentor what she needed to do to grow in her career, he replied \"You need to get out of your comfort zone.\" It was then I realized, traveling to new places, meeting new people and experiencing new things is a great way to push your life beyond the limits.\n\nThose words inspired me to prepare for my SAT exams, to take them and apply to the University of California. Although the distance between Vilnius and San Francisco is just under six thousand miles, I am more excited about the opportunities ahead rather than the distance in between.  I have realized that I must overcome the difficulties and try to reach my goal - education in the United States. Conferences like \u0093Silicon Valley Comes to Baltics\u0094 proved to me that if you want, everything is possible. I have realized that my dreams which I thought are unrealistic one day may actually come true.\n\nIf not for the many entrepreneurship, startups events, hackathons and the people who I met along the way, I would not be who I am today. Now I know that every time I face difficulties in my life I must overcome them and try to reach my goal.\n\n\n\n\n2.\"Tell us about a personal quality, talent, accomplishment, contribution or experience that is important to you. What about this quality or accomplishment makes you proud and how does it relate to the person you are?\"\n\nA clock is ticking on the wall, counting the last ten minutes to submit our application. Something went wrong- the screen of the application is blank and all  seems completely ruined for our team. The manager announces that the presentation of apps is upcoming in five minutes, we still can not find the bug, so we are trying to find our mistake by randomly changing code. Luckily,  we find out what is wrong and submit our final application just couple of minutes before the final deadline. The  relief and joyfulness in my face is so big that I forget  to prepare my speech for  presenting our application. Despite that, the presentation succeeds and everyone is happy with our result.\n\nThese are the moments from the \u0093Wix Hackathon\u0094, in which  me and my friends were participating  to develop the Skype Widget for Wix App store. We were the youngest participants there. Nevertheless, we proved that we can make applications as good as graduates of computer science. Creating that application was not something like a big accomplishment for me, but seeing Wix employees who congratulated and encouraged us telling that despite of being very young as well as other more professional participants and ensured us that couple of years later we will hopefully create own startups. It really made us  feel proud of our work.\n\nWhen I registered to the Wix Hackathon, all I knew was a little background in programming that I learned at school or at  home \u0097some C++, Java, HTML and CSS. However,In the event  we had  to create a web application and no one from my team had had a background in web development before. So, in two days period, during which we coded the application,  I have learned much more about creating web applications than I could learn in a month if studying by myself. Our team was consisted from  only three persons so I had a great chance to express myself in different  areas: from coding the application to marketing it and creating its logo. The period of two days was a really short time for developing an application, so  we had to rush all the time, not  having much time for relaxation. The constant hurry and adrenaline really motivated me to try harder and achieve what firstly seemed  to be almost impossible - to create a full working application. Luckily, I achieved my goal and I felt really proud of it.\n\nI find this quite parallel to my life. I always try to create goals, which would be challenges to complete and love working forwards achieving them. When I read or hear about some new technologies, I always try to experiment with them in spite of that I am not well  knowledgeable about them. Teamwork is also very important for me, because there people complement each other, and by doing that they can achieve significant results.

Some of these people feel strongly that their previous failures taught them\nvaluable lessons and led to their later successes. Others maintain that they went on to achieve\nsuccess for entirely different reasons. In your opinion, can failure lead to success? Or is failure\nsimply its own experience? In your essay, take a position on this question. You may write\nabout either one of the two points of view given, or you may present a different point of\nview on this question. Use specific reasons and examples to support your position.\n\nEssay:\nAn individual's definition of \"success\" is subject to change with every individual I might ask.  Who am I to say what is successful and what is not?  A person's life goals can be obtained with no effort at all, and he might easily obtain this goal with minimal risks of failing; while another person will have to fail miserably on several occasions in order to obtain his goal. However one might see his successes and failures, I say that all failures are successes because failure to obtain one's goal can greatly impact his future chances of obtaining his goal positively.\n\nWe do not start off walking when we are born.  We crawl, then we become upright and stumble, and then we master walking.  Depending on the person's goal in life, it might take several stumbles to obtain the goal.  An actor might audition for 100 shows and only get a small part in a low-budget movie.  However, if he auditions for 10,000 shows then he has a higher probability of obtaining a better part.  And even if he were to fail 90% of the 10,000 times he auditioned, he would still have gotten a higher chance to land a better role than if he had failed 90% of his 100 auditions.\n\nBut what does this have to do with success? Well, because the more the actor fails in his audition, the more he can refine his skills to become a better actor. The actor would have vastly improved through the 9,000 failures he experienced if he auditioned for the 10,000 parts. Even if he lands a role he doesn't want, it is still an opportunity to improve himself through that role.\n\nThe actor might vastly improve through his failures, but again, who am I to say he will become successful if everyone's definition of successful is different? It does not matter what the person's definition of successful is, failure is results and results improve the individual's skills and helps insight on what he/she needs to do to make sure the next try is a success. Whether or not the person thinks he/she has failed, failure helps achieve success.\n\nFailure is the prerequisite for improving. Even if the person fails a multitude of times, each failure points out something that needs improvement. Whether or not the person thinks he/she is obtaining his goal is totally irrelevant to whether or not he/she is actually becoming successful. Each failure is a success, just as each baby step and stumble is a step and a stumble closer to walking.\n"}, {"date": "2014-02-18T23:39:53+00:00", "url": "http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/canada/1617402-legal-action-against-school.html", "messages": "\n                    Hello everybody,\n\nPlease read this; I desperately need your advice.\nI'm a 3rd yr international student in a medium sized school in Canada (certainly not one of the top, but 200 yrs old) \u201cSick\u201d does not even begin to describe how I feel about this school. I\u2019ll try to leave my feelings aside and tell you how things work at this school, and please tell me what you would do in my situation.\nSome of the things this school has done to me:\n\u2022\tIn my second year (I studied the first 2 years at another Canadian college that was affiliated with this school) they decided to make major changes to the curriculum\u2026. And apply them to everybody, including current students. This cost me 1.5  years to complete (one year doing the new  courses and 6 months convincing the embassy that I still haven\u2019t finished my 2 year program)\u2026 Anyway, by the time I was supposed to be graduating, I finally got accepted in the third year.\n\n\u2022\tOne of the third year courses turned out to be a course I took at the old school and got an A.. I applied for equivalency and it was accepted. I have to say that the secretary responsible for the department is an extremely, extremely, rude person.\n\n\u2022\tMy academic experience in this university was rather terrible:\n\nWe had one professor who consistently spread pure misinformation, and would argue with the entire class about it (If there are engineering students here I can give some examples \u2013 at points this seemed funny and sad at the same time)\n\nWe had another professor who bombarded us with insane prelab requirements for a relatively easy course , so you would be staying until 3 AM working on his prelabs, leaving us no time to study for other courses.  Also, his marking of finals just didn\u2019t make sense.\n\nAnd finally, we had a professor who is a complete liar:\n-\tAt one point he gave us an assignment where one problem was mistaken in the book. I discovered this too late. I sent him an email (after it was due)\u2013 no response. I talked to him about it At first, he told me he did read my email , but he insisted that the assignment is okay, and it must have been a mistake in my algebra, and that NO ONE MENTIONED IT TO HIM ! After some time, he agreed to actually open the book and see it. He found out that it was mistaken and gave me the marker\u2019s info so I can tell him to give me the marks for this problem. I\u2019ll come back to this guy later.\nAnyway, after the term was finally over, my results were out:\n-\tThe course for which  I applied for equivalency (which I depended on as a gpa booster) appeared nowhere on my transcript, no mention of it whatsoever\n-\tMy marks for the courses were pretty much along the average, except for the 2 courses I took with the liar, he gave me a D on one course (average grade: B) and an F for the other (Average grade: B-).\nNeedless to say, my term gpa was very low and resulted in an Academic dismissal.\nI tried to talk to the liar, and guess what, I found out my marks for the assignment were not added as promised, he DENIED that he told me he\u2019ll give me tha marks back, he claimed that so many students asked him about this error and he corrected it for them. And when I reminded him that HE HIMSELF gave me the TA\u2019s information, he retracted again and said it\u2019s up to him. This increased my total grade by 1% but was still an F (48).\nBy the time I knew that this guy was such a liar, accompanied with the fact that I thought I did good on the final, I applied for a reassessment of my final exam, more than a month ago. They haven\u2019t done a thing about it ever since.\nI also contacted several people by email politely explaining the issue with untransfered course (in which I got an A), and that my transfer request was approved but not acted upon, no response whatsoever. One representative asked me to send her my id and then no response whatsoever (just nothing at all \u2013 not positive and not negative) I even contacted the associate dean, they don\u2019t say anything back.\nThe only thing they sent me was notification of academic dismissal and that I\u2019m required to take courses (completely unrelated to my field) until the dismissal is over, and then apply again (without confirmation of acceptance)\nAt this point I was considering legal action against this school, but I\u2019m not sure if it is any good.\n\nWhat would you do if you were in my shoes? I don\u2019t want to transfer somewhere else because it will cost me even more time to graduate.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}, {"date": "2014-03-09T16:30:47+00:00", "url": "http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/sat-act-tests-test-preparation/1623701-bates-college-study-of-sat-optional-is-in-the-news-again.html", "messages": "\n                    SAT-optional Bates College has been conducting a long-term study comparing students who submit SAT scores with those who do not.

Bates is probably happy to find justification for its SAT-optional status. They argue that you don't need test scores to predict college success. However, I have not seen any evidence that non-submitters actually have lower SAT scores. You would think that the non-submitters have lower scores but this is unproven.\n\nFurthermore, how do you reconcile the Bates results with the fact that there is a very high correlation between graduation rates and average SAT scores?

Be aware that my stats in early high school were extremely low, but I like to think I've made huge improvements in recent years. Perhaps a significant enough improvement to be accepted into an amazing law school.

So i just recently bought the Real ACT Prep Guide Red Book to study for a couple of months to take the ACT.\n\nI have taken the SAT twice the first try i got an 1850 (M:750 CR:520 W:580) and second it dropped to 1750 (I would like to point out that i didn't study for them at all. I know that's stupid but i went in blindly into the first one just to get a feel of it). I know those scores are barely decent but not great by any standard.\n\nI just recently returned from a camp where my roommate told me he actually got an 1850 also, although his breakdown was like 700;550;600 or something of that sort. He took the ACT at the end of last school year and he got a 32 which according to my research is 2160-2210 on the SAT converted. His strong point was math also and he had trouble on the reading and writing like me so he recommended the ACT to me. We both excel in math and science over english and SS at school and on tests.\n\nI'm kind of stuck as College apps are due December 1st and taking the next SAT in October would mean getting results in mid to end November, which may cut it short. However the ACT is mid Sep so results would come early-to mid October which gives me extra time for last minute additions to apps and things of that nature.\n\nWhat would you guys recommend?

In high school I went to an alternative, progressive private high school that was much easier and far more nurturing than your typical public high school. I had a 3.0 GPA and I got in to 7 of the 8 colleges I applied to. I decided to go to Drexel University to study fashion design, it was probably the toughest school I got into. When I got there it was a horrible experience that I was not at all prepared for. The work load was insane i was up until 3am or later most nights doing work. I was constantly miserable, exhausted and behind in my work. As a result my gpa plummeted. I have a 2.3 GPA and was actually placed on academic probation this last quarter because I had a 1.9 GPA for the spring term. At that point I had already been to my advisor many times and other places on campus that were supposed to help me and they all seemed to suggest I was in the wrong school and that I would be better off at a traditional semester school with a slower pace. So once I found out I was on probation I decided that they were right and I couldn't go back after having such a horrible experience. I decided I would either go to Moore College of Art and Design or Philadelphia University. I had gotten in to Philadelphia University my senior year and was even offered a scholarship but chose Drexel instead. I didn't think I would have too much trouble getting in but I just got off the phone with admissions and after seeing my transcript from Drexel with the 2.3 GPA they said they couldn't consider me at this time and that they were looking for someone with a 3.0 or higher. So I want to know what is one to do in this type of situation. I would think that colleges would recognize the fact that students transfer because they are not at the right college and their GPAs may have suffered as a result.

Anyways, I'm looking to apply to UVA, William & Mary, Washington & Lee, and University of Richmond, and any help would be gradually appreciated.  The prompt that this is addressing is a story or background that you feel your application would be incomplete without.\n\nWhy do teenagers today seem to lack motivation?  Today, I read two Tweets dealing with the general apathy of teenagers.  \u201cThe amount of *explicitives* given is equal to the amount of honest politicians in Congress\u201d one Tweet said, \u201cnot even a motivational speech can get me through the school year\u201d another said.  Teenagers nowadays lack energy and drive, because they don\u2019t take the time to see what motivates them.  My source of energy and motivation can be best described by the Michaelangelo quotation, \u201cThe greater danger for most of us lies not in setting our aim too high and falling short; but in setting our aim too low, and achieving our mark\u201d.  Through the story of my middle school career, I have determined that the key to my success is my desire to overachieve and set my goals high.\nLike most teenagers, I was quite lazy at times throughout middle school.  The only thing that motivated me at all was the fear of my mother yelling at me.  \u201cIf you don\u2019t improve your grades, I can take away all of your electronics and make your life miserable\u201d I remember my mom angrily shouting at me. Since I hated being yelled at, I set my goal to avoid my mom yelling at me.  In order to achieve this goal, I did the bare minimum; study when mom told me to and earn all A\u2019s except for a B+ in math.  I did just that for a year and a half, and pleased my mom so much that she told me that she would stop yelling at me and getting on my case.  Since I had set my aim too low and achieved a goal that I easily achieved, I lost my motivation and willpower.  Since my drive is the engine behind my academic success, my grades began to slide downhill, until I reached a low point.  I received the grade of a D- on a quiz, and I remembered  staring at the piece of paper, devastated, and praying that the D- was actually an A-.\nIn many ways, this failure was a new beginning for me.  I realized that my old way of relying on my mom to motivate me and giving myself easily achievable goals was not working.  I Googled quotes about success, and came across the Michaelangelo quote in the introduction.  I thought about how I could apply this quote to my life, and I thought a good goal would be to earn the honor of valedictorian of my middle school class. Since I was so adamant about achieving this goal, I studied day and night, convinced my mother to hire a tutor, and met with my teachers to review concepts that I probably had a good grasp of, just to make sure I knew them.  Because of my newfound motivation, my grades began to skyrocket.  From that point on, I achieved straight A\u2019s throughout middle school, and graduated with a 97 average.  I was devastated however, when I discovered that I didn\u2019t achieve my goal of becoming valedictorian.  I was literally a fraction of a percent away from earning the title, but I  achieved the honor of salutatorian.  I realized that I had a lot to be proud of, because I was able to find my own way to achieve success and I achieved what was practically unthinkable a year before.\nI carried on this philosophy of setting my goals *just* out of my reach throughout my career in public high school and met similar results.  I have been able to hold a position in the top 4% of my class and obtain decent SAT scores due to the motivation from my extremely high aims.  Through my middle school career, I have learned that my success depends so deeply on my motivation, a result of my goals.

I ask because it seems that international applications are likely one of if not the biggest factor driving the overall reduction in acceptance rates.  Consider the numbers in  this snippet form the Atlantic: \"In six years, boarding schools like Deerfield and The Hotchkiss School in Connecticut reported a ten-fold increase in the number of Chinese applications. Each received less than 20 applicants in the 2005-2006 academic year and more than 200 in 2011-2012.\"  If I assume that the trend has generally continued, Hotchkiss for example might have had just under 300 applicants from China alone in 2014.  Scanning the web, I see total applicant numbers posted in the 1800 range, so if China alone has grown to be 300, and other countries are following a similar pattern, the international applicant pool as a percentage of the total pool should be extraordinarily high.  Pairing this with the fact that Hotchkiss (just as an example here) is only 17% international in composition, and it seems like the math has to point to international students having a HUGELY lower acceptance rate than domestic.\n\nIn fact, I am having trouble even reconciling numbers...I have no firm numbers to work with, which of course is not a good place to start, but just to test the thinking around the differences in acceptance rates, I ran the following example for Hotchkiss ( I am not picking on this school, but had to pick something for the example).  Most are based upon numbers that were documented somewhere, and of course could be wrong.  If they are radically wrong it will matter.  If they are slightly wrong, I don't think the result will change.\n\nInput data:\nApplicants = 1770 (Admissionquest website)\nInternational applications = 600 (best guess)\nDomestic applications = 1170 (result of guess above)\nOverall acceptance rate = 22% (Admissionquest website)\nYield = 53% (Admissionquest website)\nTotal new students = 150 (guess based on student body of 600)\nInternational student % = 17% (Admissionquest website)\n\nIf I run the yield/applicant/slot calculations, the above data would imply 150 slots at 53% yield would require making 283 offers.  With 1770 applicants, this is more like a 16% admit rate rather than a 22% admit rate.  To get to 22% you either need to have far fewer applicants, or a much worse yield rate.  Not sure I think there is much of a chance that Hotchkiss is way south of 50% yield, so I am going to for the moment assume that the most likely thing here is the 22% is wrong and the admit rate is more like 16%.\n\nWith the above in mind, if the application distribution is as noted between domestic and international, and we assume that the 17% international student percentage mirrors the admits (has to be true if the time horizon is long enough), then the domestic admit rate would be just over 20% (126 slots at 53% yield = 237 offers on 1170 applications).  By contrast, the international admit rate would be 7.5% (same math).  This would imply to me anyway that much of the increase in selectivity is largely a data problem driven by out-sized international application growth rather than a more uniform change in the playing field.\n\nSo with the big quantitative preamble, I am curious if anyone has any actual data, or better math.  I would further assume the conditional probability of domestic full pay has to only elevate the 20% to something much higher, perhaps as much as 30%.  Curious if others have ever run the math, or seen the data...\n\nPS - I spent a little time poking around on the topic and did not see any good information, so if I missed it and it has been covered elsewhere, I apologize...

Could anyone be so generous to help me grade this essay and give me some advices on how to improve it as well ?\n\nPrompt : Are widely held views often wrong, or are such views more likely to be correct ?\n\n---\n\nPublic views have always been considered one of the best sources of opinions. However, such popular beliefs tend to be affected by various factors, resulting in hidden misconception. History and literature was repleted with proofs of common knowledge being indeed very far from the truth.\n\nA prominent example of this can be found in Jane Austen's novel, Pride and Prejudice. At the beginning, Darcy, the male protagonist, was deemed by the neighborhood of Hertfordshire to be a selfish and prideful man who was considerate of nothing save himself and his family. As a result from a story circulating Meryton, he was also resented for robbing his childhood friend Wickham of the latter's rightful inheritance and sponsors which the late Mr. Darcy had promisded. Wickham, on the other hand, was regarded as a gentleman with amicable disposition. However, as the plot processed, we learned of a sharply contrasting truth. Wickham himself had given up his supposed dedication to the church, thus going against the notions upon which Darcy's father had based his support. It was Wickham's own unacceptable behaviour that had forced Darcy to remove the sponsor, though he was still tolerable toward his former friend, even paying the debts Wickham left behind. The caustic tale about Darcy was only the forgery of Wickham's resentment and hatred after the former refused to give him money to supply his extravagant causes. What the people of Herfortshire credited to be the undeniable truth was actually a despicable lie, and it was their prejudices and gullible judgments that had led them to misinterpret the true virtues of the two characters.\n\nBeside stemming from subjective opinions, misleading information might be based on what was thought to be concrete truths. Geocentrism, for instance, was once regarded as the redimentary of all knowledge we possessed about the universe and geography. For many centuries, renowned philosophers and astronomists had supported this theory, notably Aristotle and Ptolemy, believing that the Earth is the centre of the universe. It was not until the 17th that this description was challenged by Copernicus, who presented the heliocentrism, placing the Sun at the centre of the Solar System that included the Earth. Further observation and elaboration had expanded this theory and by the 20th century, people came to accept it and even figure out that the whole Solar System was only a part of a galaxy. Despite being disregarded as nonsense by countless opposing arguments when it was first made public, heliocentrism overthrew the long-imprinted influence of geocentrism to become foundation of many modern astronomical theories.\n\nOverall, ubiquitously known opinions were not the undeniable truths. Before accepting any of such information to be right, we should take them into careful consideration and observation. Only by doing that could we avoid making the mistakes our predecessors have stumbled over many times : to let popular opinions clouded our own judgements.\n\n---\n\nThank you very much for reading and helping !

Thoughts?\n\nPrompt: Is the way something seems to be not always the same as it actually is?\n\nRESPONSE\n\nAppearances are frequently deceiving. As illustrated in works of film, recent findings in social psychology, and in the politics we encounter on an everyday basis, the way something appears at first glance is rarely true to what it is upon further analysis.\n\nA demonstrated by Spirited Away, simple appearances can betray a huge depth of complexity. In Hayao Miyazaki\u2019s Oscar Award-wining animated film, what begins as a tedious family move-in day swiftly becomes a full-scale adventure as understated, anxiety-stricken, ten-year-old protagonist Chihiro attempts to navigate the spirit world to reunite herself with her parents. Everything in the film, from the character design to the plot twists, propagate the idea that even the most dull of situations can carry the potential to shock and surprise.\n\nSimilarly, Malcom Gladwell\u2019s novel \u2018The Outliers\u2019 tackles what he refers to as \u201cThe Myth of Success\u201d and surmises that often what appears to be success as a result of natural-born talent is, in fact, the result of extreme bouts of hard work. Drawing case examples from a wide variety of disciplines including music, sports, and engineering technology, Gladwell builds a case for this \u201c10,000 Hour Rule,\u201d expediting that success isn\u2019t as it seems\u2014the product of an innate gift\u2014but rather, the product of long hours of work.\n\nThe Miss America Pageant presents perhaps the strongest case to take appearances with a grain of salt, and underscores the necessity that exists in delving deeper to unveil truth. The organization, calling itself a scholarship competition, presents itself to any unsuspecting onlooker as being an organization with a single-minded interest in a woman\u2019s intellectual vitality. The Miss America contest, however, allocates only 20 seconds of a contestant\u2019s entire performance to the Question and Answer section, instead allocating large portions of the contest to such events as swimsuit competition. Logical consideration immediately reveals a gross discrepancy between its aims and its actions; a preliminary look could not stand further from reality in this case.\n\nAfter careful consideration of the Miss America Pageant, Malcom Gladwell\u2019s \u2018The Outliers,\u2019 and Hayao Miyazaki\u2019s \u2018Spirited Away,\u2019 it\u2019s made clear appearances are insufficient in garnering a true appreciation of reality. The events of our time, with their many causes and effects, cannot be processed on appearances alone; to do so would be to oversimplify and potentially misunderstand them entirely, as illustrated by the examples of this essay.

Drawing case examples from a wide variety of disciplines including music, sports, and engineering technology, Gladwell builds a case for this \u201c10,000 Hour Rule,\u201d expediting that success isn\u2019t as it seems\u2014the product of an innate gift\u2014but rather, the product of long hours of work.\n\nThe Miss America Pageant presents perhaps the strongest case to take appearances with a grain of salt, and underscores the necessity that exists in delving deeper to unveil truth. The organization, calling itself a scholarship competition, presents itself to any unsuspecting onlooker as being an organization with a single-minded interest in a woman\u2019s intellectual vitality. The Miss America contest, however, allocates only 20 seconds of a contestant\u2019s entire performance to the Question and Answer section, instead allocating large portions of the contest to such events as swimsuit competition. Logical consideration immediately reveals a gross discrepancy between its aims and its actions; a preliminary look could not stand further from reality in this case.\n\nAfter careful consideration of the Miss America Pageant, Malcom Gladwell\u2019s \u2018The Outliers,\u2019 and Hayao Miyazaki\u2019s \u2018Spirited Away,\u2019 it\u2019s made clear appearances are insufficient in garnering a true appreciation of reality. The events of our time, with their many causes and effects, cannot be processed on appearances alone; to do so would be to oversimplify and potentially misunderstand them entirely, as illustrated by the examples of this essay.\n"}, {"date": "2014-10-07T18:37:09+00:00", "url": "http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/college-life/1693091-confused-about-continuing-education.html", "messages": "\n                    Hi everyone, I am a 22 years old Indian currently pursuing master's degree in an interdisciplinary field from IIT Kharagpur. (can't reveal the field without revealing my identity.) I have a B.E. in computer science from a respected university. My GATE score put me among top 600 students, but I struggled to score well in the college exams due to my incompatibility with the system. (read: I tried to mug up things instead of preparing thoroughly like I was used to, then I tried to get back to my original habits. I ended up being unsuccessful at both.) If IITs didn't have caste-based reservation and relaxed admission policies, I would never be here. Also, I should mention that I am highly introverted and the opposite of athletic. My 'incompatibility' resulted into depression for a brief period of time. As a result, I am now more introverted than I ever was. I chose IIT Kharagpur because I didn't pass the pre-interview test at IIT Bombay. I couldn't attend interviews at Delhi and Kharagpur because, well, I couldn't be at 3 places at 3 corners of the country, at least not without significant planning and expense. So when I couldn't pass the test at IITB, I decided to accept the direct admission offer from IIT KGP. Instead of looking for other opportunities for Mtech in CS, I chose an interdisciplinary course at IITKGP, let's call this course X. When the fateful day came and I traveled to KGP and completed my registration, I was shocked to know that course X was cancelled due to insufficient capacity (Read: people thought that they had better options than some **** interdisciplinary course.) and I was given a consolation that I would be given admission into another field like CS or IT. But unfortunately, admission into these courses was not direct and I didn't attend the interviews, so they couldn't grant me admission. Instead, they offered me another field Y. They basically offered me a Hobson's choice: Choose field Y or leave IIT. I wasn't ready to leave after spending a month mentally preparing myself, so I instantly made a choice: I chose field Y. I started attending classes. When I felt like I wasn't into the field, I was advised by faculty members who asked me to sleep on it and think carefully before making the decision. Two months went by after that and I continued attending lectures and labs. Am I interested in the field? No more than I would have had I been an outsider learning about it from Internet. I saw more than one examples of other students and received numerous advises that I should leave and devote my time to something more useful and productive. After a brief vacation and a visit to my home, those feelings of quitting the course are coming back. The only things that have kept me interested are the free internet (not technically since i paid some fees), experience of living on my own (apart from the fact that most things are easily available within the campus itself), access to the fastest LAN in the country (music, games, movies, tv series, software, whatever you want is available and shared), and the 8000 rupees/month stipend. I didn't perform very well in the midterms except for statistics which is actually just mathematics. Earlier i had decided that I would take the decision after completing at least a semester, but now I don't think I have enough patience.\ntl;dr. I am pursuing a course but I don't know why. The question that's eating my mind: should i continue studying this course, hoping that I would get interested in it? Should i leave and start looking for alternate career options?

However, this theory has never been proven. In fact, there is relatively little evidence that suggests any test has an easier, or for that matter harsher, curve.\n\nInterestingly, those who believe that certain curves will be easier forget an important point-the test is curved to account for difficulty. Kinder curves are made for harder tests while harsher curves accompany easier tests. This is done to make each test essentially equal to each other. Nonetheless, it is still worth asking the question: Are any SAT curves easier?\n\nThis Mini-Study\n\nThis Mini-study seeks to address this question of SAT curve difficulties. Thanks to data gathered by erikthered, it is possible to view the curves of 20 past SAT\u2019s. This mini-study uses statistics in order to analyze whether any of the curves is actually easier (or harsher) than others.\n\nThroughout this mini-study I employ a bit of statistical jargon. If you haven\u2019t taken stats, don\u2019t fret; just skip down to the conclusion where I explain the results in plain English.\n\nWARNING!!\n\nI must warn against drawing any definitive conclusions!!! I do draw my own personal conclusions at the end, but I do not guarantee these to be 100% correct. This data is likely insufficient to warrant adjusting one\u2019s testing schedule. This mini-study was done merely out of curiosity sake. I do not believe it is prudent to use this mini-study to decide which test to take, hoping to score an easier curve. As I said earlier, the tests are curved to adjust for difficulty. Also, there is the chance that I made a mistake somewhere along the line.\n\nMethodology\n\nThe data was taken offline from erikthered\u2019s PDF that lists 20 past curves. 7 were from October, 6 from May, 6 from January, and one from March. Because there was insufficient data for March, only May, January, and October were compared. The curves were also compared by section. Thus, there were nine month/section combinations being compared.\n\nTo find the difficulty of the curve, the first thing that I did was take the average scaled scores from the first 15 raw scores for each sitting (similar to what erikthered did). A higher average indicates a kinder curve (and harder test) while a lower average indicates a harsher curve (and easier test). Each month\u2019s data was then combined and average. Two-tailed hypothesis testing was used to compare the three months. Positive t-scores indicate a kinder curve while negative t-scores indicate a harsher curve. Two-tail alpha was set to 0.1, so the critical cutoff was roughly 1.943 standard deviations.\n\nStatistics Box\n\nA common theme that runs through this mini-study is the z-score/t-score. Simply put, the z-score is the number of standard deviations that the data is from the average. Standard deviation is a measure of how widely spread the data is. It is the average distance that a data point is from the center.\n\nAnother number that is used is the p-value. P-value is the probability that a result occurs because of natural variability. If a p-value is very high (for example, 50%), then that indicates that there is a 50% chance that the effect was due to natural variability.\n\nAlpha is the maximum acceptable p-value for the result to be considered \u201cstatistically significant.\u201d Significance indicates that it is likely not due to chance and that there is something going on. Statistically significant should not be confused with the common definition of significant, which normally means \u201ca lot.\u201d Results (as you shall soon see) can be statistically significant without actually being significant.\n\n\nThe second test done broke each curve down into the top 15 scaled/raw scores. Each of the 15 highest scaled scores for each sitting was compared to the average scaled score throughout all the curves for the identical raw score. Thus, for each SAT sitting I generated 15 points of data that gave how much above or below average the scaled score was for the same raw score for each curve. To be honest, I\u2019m not sure if this is allowed in stats. But I went ahead anyways!\n\nOnce again, I performed two-tailed hypothesis test with alpha=.1. Because of the large sample size, 1.645 became the critical cutoff. The z-score that was produced signified how many standard deviations away from the average the scaled score of the curve was away from the average scaled score for the corresponding raw score. For each month there was between 90 and 105 data points, depending on the month.\n\nResults\n\nThe table below indicates the results. Positive z-scores indicate a kinder curve while negative z-scores indicate a harsher curve. The absolute value of the z-scores indicates the significance of the result with higher absolute values indicating greater significance. I also averaged the three subjects to get each month\u2019s z-score. The top half of the table is for the first tests where the curves were compared as one unit while the bottom half of the table is for the second test where the curves were broken down into smaller parts. This table DOES NOT show how much the curves actually were above or below average, only the z-score.

Although for several months and several sections the curve was found to be significantly harsher/kinder, in no instances did both tests agree that the curve was actually different for any combination. The fact that the two tests never both indicated significance for any month/section combo suggests that any \u201csignificance\u201d must be taken with caution.\n\nWhen the curves were taken as a whole (all three sections), none of the months were significantly different from the average. When averaged out through all three sections, none of the months is more than .56 standard deviations from the average in the first test. This indicates that there is a very high probability (close to 29%) that this result was due to natural variability. Remember, the chance that it is due to natural variability must be less than 10% for the result to be considered significant.\n\nFor the broken tests, the results were a bit different. There actually were several months/subject combos that displayed high enough significance to be different from the mean. Some of the month/section combos even had up to 5.8 sigma confidence (enough to prove the existence of a new particle). However, although there was a statistically significant difference for several months/sections, the actual difference was miniscule. At best, the October sitting of the SAT for the critical reading was above average (indicating an easier curve) by a mere 5.09 points. Differences of just 2 or 3 points were much more common. The likely reason that they were so statistically significant was because the way the tests were performed created roughly a hundred data points per month, considerably shrinking the standard deviation.\n\nWhen the broken tests were averaged out, none of the months were statistically significantly different from the others. The one that came closest was the January sitting (The reason it is not significant at alpha=.1 is because a two-tailed test was used. Had it been one-tailed, the p-value of .0545 would have been considered significant at alpha=.1)\n\nConclusion\n\nThe primary conclusions that can be drawn is as follows. Keep in mind that these are merely my conclusions and are not guaranteed to be correct:\n\n\nTo put it sweetly and simply for those of you who are getting tired of slogging through AP stats jargon:\n\nThere were no month/section combos that were significantly different from the average in both statistical tests. In the ones that were significant in one test, the effect was so small that it would not warrant changing testing date.\n\nOnce again, keep in mind that although the curves may be (very slightly) different from month to month, the tests are created so that the difficulty of the test and the curve cancel out so that each sitting is roughly the same difficulty.\n\nSome of you may have noticed something that I did incorrectly. Because each month represented roughly one third of the data, I violated the 10% condition in which no more than 10% of the population may be sampled. However, the reason for this condition is because samplings above 10% cause the sample to no longer be normal and instead resemble the population. But because the population was roughly normal, I did not think this would be a major issue.\n\nIf there is anything that I did incorrectly throughout my mini-study, please tell me and I will try and fix it. I typed this up in a single day so I didn\u2019t spend a lot of time developing a perfect method.\n\nFinally, thanks to erikthered/fignewton for posting all of the past SAT curves. This mini-study would not have been possible without you.\n\n\nQuestions? Comments? Concerns? Compliments? Rants? Rages? Post away!

Standardized testing is known to be used worldwide to determine many decisions for school, students, staff, and so on.  For instance, majority of the school districts use standardized testing scores to determine a school\u0092s future.   In addition, test scores have been overemphasized throughout the general education system.  According to Bronwyn T. Williams, an associate professor of English and director of composition of the University of Louisville, he states:\n\u0093Incessant testing regimes, such as the infamous No Child Left Behind(2002) law in\nthe United States (known ruefully among many teachers as NO Teacher Left\nStanding), focus on broad comparisons of students, with little regard to\ntheir differences, and severe punishments for schools and teachers who fail\nto meet the \u0091standards\u0092.\u0094 (Williams 604)\nHe provides an idea of the overemphasis of standardized testing scores and its importance to the future of each and almost every school.  With the many faults that standardized testing has created, our education system has been the most damaged. Today, standardized testing has negatively influenced our educational system by determining the future of schools and students, lowering the quality of teaching, and providing false information about one\u0092s actual knowledge.  Therefore, standardized testing should not be used in schools because it has tremendously damaged our educational system.\nStandardized testing has become one of the most influential factors in determining the future of schools and students; as a result, many outstanding schools are labeled as failure due to the AYP, also known as adequate yearly progress.  In addition, many students are also faced with many struggles relating to their future.  According to the video, A Teacher's Guide to Fixing No Child Left Behind, the video illustrates that the law:\n\u0093NCLB [No Child Left Behind] also brought with it a host of unintended\nconsequences.  It is a law with all sticks and no carrots.  Under NCLB, teachers\nhave been unfairly blamed for failing schools.  And it provided schools to focus\nefforts on teaching to poorly-designed bubble tests.  Under this broken\naccountability system, some perfectly good schools can be misidentified as\n\u0091failing\u0092 because they don\u0092t meet their education goals, identified as Adequate\nYearly Progress, or AYP.\u0094 (\u0093A Teacher\u0092s Guide\u0094)\nThis video specifies the many flaws our educational system has gained when this law has been passed.  The government stresses out that this law will allow them to measure improvement.  Consequently, this law also ranks decent schools as failing just because of the test results.  This is unfair because not many students are gifted to be great test takers; in fact, it is a skill to do well on tests.  The government also accentuates that having high testing scores marks improvement within our educational system.  However, standardized test scores do not reflect one\u0092s actual knowledge, but are an inaccurate measurement.  The government considers test scores as the only way to fairly discover if students are improving; hence, school districts and staff are pressured into \u0093teaching to the tests,\u0094 and ignoring the real materials students are supposed to learn.  From my past experience when I was still in high school, I\u0092ve witnessed way too many banners and heard countless reminders from the principal and teachers to do well on the STAR/CST tests \u0096 also known as the California Standardized Tests.  Every year, the school would gather each class to remind us to do extremely well on our CST tests and to attain higher scores than our rival high schools.  This overemphasis of test scores demonstrates how important the test scores are.  However, these kinds of tests are better than SATs, also known as the Scholastic Aptitude Test, and ACT, which stands for American College Testing.  While all three tests can be unfair when measuring improvement and knowledge of students, STAR testing is more ideal because students are tested based on what has been taught during the whole school year.  On the other hand, SATs and ACTs consist of cumulated topics during the course of high school.  These tests are put in a tricky way that many students struggle to do well on these tests.  Because of this, many students aren\u0092t accepted into the colleges of their choice partly because of their test results.  In an article called \u0093Standardized Testing and Its Victims\u0094 by Alfie Kohn, an author who writes on educational and parenting issues, reports that \u0093standardized-testing scores often measure superficial thinking\u0094 (Kohn 599).  He provides evidence that these tests don\u0092t truly measure a student\u0092s critical thinking; also, they are open to make any educational guesses since these tests are multiple choice.  As a result, some students do terrible on tests, which makes it more difficult to be accepted from colleges.  Overall, standardized tests like SATs and ACTs are considered a road block to the bright future of schools and students.\nThe overemphasis of standardized testing has lowered the quality of teaching today, which has immensely damaged our educational system.  The obsession of standardized testing has limited many teachers ability to teach materials that are actually crucial and will benefit students\u0092 lives, and instead, teachers are focused on teaching to the tests.  Since standardized testing scores determine the future of schools and the school staffs jobs, they concentrate more on improving students\u0092 test scores than to pay more attention to what students are actually gaining from the overemphasis of standardized testing.  In some cases, some of the best teachers quit their professions as teaching to the tests affects their ability to teach because they are pressured into teaching students to do extremely well on standardized tests.  Kohn points out that \u0093many educators are leaving the field [of education] because of what is being done to schools in the name of \u0091accountability\u0092 and \u0091tougher standards\u0092\u0094 (Kohn 600).  The high expectations of having high test scores has altered the idea of what should be taught to what is being taught today.  Teachers are pressured into teaching the materials necessary to ace standardized tests, which prevents students to become prepared for college and their future careers.  In an online article called \u0093How Standardized Testing Damages Education\u0094, the unknown author claims that, \u0093Tests that measure as little and as poorly as multiple-choice tests cannot provide genuine accountability. Pressure to teach to the test distorts and narrows education. Instead of being accountable to parents, community, teachers and students, schools become \u0091accountable\u0092 to a completely unregulated testing industry\u0094 (\u0093How Standardized Testing\u0094).  The author agrees that teaching to the tests decreases the quality of knowledge gained from teachers.  This passage proves that standardized testing has negatively influenced our education system; in addition, it has also given many students disadvantages to be able to prepare for the future.\nStandardized testing is not an accurate measure of one\u0092s actual knowledge; in fact, these tests are unfair to students because they are biased.  Therefore, these tests are damaging the educational system.  SATs and ACTs are a great example of an inaccurate measure of intelligence; they are based upon bubble marks which do not reflect a student\u0092s critical thinking.  However, it is often required that all students must take them in order to apply and be accepted to colleges.  Furthermore, these tests are one of the four major factors in determining a student\u0092s eligibility to be accepted into an institution. This is unfair to many students, especially to those who are not good test takers, because it forbids them to get into the college of their choice.  In addition, it does not display their actual knowledge.  Actual knowledge is displayed through critical thinking and applying their overall knowledge to solve problems. In an online article called \u0093How Standardized Testing Damages Education,\u0094 the author also asserts that:\n\u0093Despite their biases, inaccuracies, limited ability to measure achievement or\nability, and other flaws, schools use standardized tests to determine if children\nare ready for school, track them into instructional groups; diagnose for\nlearning disability, retardation and other handicaps; and decide whether to\npromote, retain in grade, or graduate many students. Schools also use tests to\nguide and control curriculum content and teaching methods.\u0094\nThe quote states everything standardized tests measures but does not mention if a student is actually learning.  Standardized tests are only used to determine a student\u0092s learning ability and whatnot, but do not measure a student\u0092s actual knowledge.  As a result, many students are negatively impacted when they receive average scores on these tests. These tests are also biased; only fortunate families can be able to afford test preparations while low-income families are at a disadvantage due to financial status.  Kohn implies, \u0093The tests may be biased.  For decades, critics have complained that many standardized tests are unfair because the questions require a set of knowledge and skills more likely to be possessed by children from a privileged background\u0094 (Kohn 600).   Not only does he claim that these tests are biased, but also emphasizes that these kinds of tests expect test taking skills and do not require critical thinking skills.  Thus, the overemphasis of standardized tests negatively affects our educational system.\nAlthough the influence of standardized tests has immensely done wrong to our educational system, it can still be mended.  The government and school districts must agree upon better solutions to fix our educational system.  Standardized tests should not have a significant importance to our education system because they do not benefit schools, students, staff, and so on.  One solution to improve our educational system is to disregard standardized tests, so that teachers have the freedom to teach their students in their own content and pace.  However, teachers are still responsible to meet the standards within each school year.  Another solution is to replace 100 percent multiple choice tests with tests such as that of the AP program, also known as Advanced Placement.  AP tests require critical thinking as these tests focus on one subject and consist of a multiple choice section and a free response section, which allows students to solve problems using the techniques they have learned throughout the course.  This way, many teachers will be able to determine what a student has actually learned throughout the year and how they applied that in order to solve problems.  As a student who took AP courses, I favor these tests than the SATs and ACTs.   Although a majority of the students find the tests to be difficult, AP tests actually reveal a student\u0092s critical thinking.  Therefore, it is ideal to have tests formatted like AP tests.  Also, another solution can be to have institutions to create their own tests, instead of using national standardized tests, and provide details of what will be tested.  Even though it may complicate matters, it will benefit students who aren\u0092t strong test takers because it will narrow down the subjects needed to be studying.  Students will be at an advantage because they will know what to focus on. There are plenty of solutions to improve our educational system, but in the end, it is up to the community the student belongs to.\n\n\n\nWork Cited\nKohn, Alfie. \u0093Standardized Testing and Its Victims.\u0094  Elements of Argument.\nRottenberg, Annette T. and Winchell, Donna Haisty, eds.

If G.I. did get a higher grade, they'll offer a sympathetic shrug and let you know you did better than so and so and keep your head up.\n\nTHE 1 HIT WONDER\n\nYou will never hear this guy/girl ever say anything, whether it be to other students or the professor. Then one day, after looking extremely intense or constipated for an hour straight, they will say something so gloriously insightful that it will bring tears to the eyes of everyone who bears witness to it.\n\nThen they will never speak again.\n\nTHE PROCRASTINATOR\n\nThis kid always procrastinates and is perpetually hurrying to finish papers or projects on deadlines. He/she work best 2-3 hrs before a deadline and are known to be b.s.-ing genius's... They always boast they procrastinate but shed years worrying about their papers!!\n\nTOO MUCH STUFF GIRL/GUY\n\nThey have a huge backpack with every book for all their classes in it. A change of clothes, an umbrella and groceries. They are always late yet will choose the seat in the front middle next to the projector maximizing the disruption to the class.\n\nBIOLOGICAL WEAPON\n\nThe B.W.even having a 103.2 fever will still attend class, and will spend more time in class coughing, sneezing, wheezing, blowing their nose, and sniffling than they do not making noise. While their dedication to education may be set in stone, it is advised to avoid this person like the plague, even if it means missing class to stay healthy.\n\nTHE KID THAT ****ING NO-ONE LIKES\n\nThis kid is a **** bag! And for arguments sake let\u0092s call him \u0093DANNY\u0094 This kid will attempt to befriend you then manage to say or do something so unspeakably rude or offer some backwards compliment. Parties disassemble whenever this Ass hat manages to find his way to one.\n\nTHE ****in' Noo Yawker aka EMPIRE STATE ****\n\nA disproportionately large number of ****in' Noo Yawkers are criminal justice, law, public administration majors. Actually from Long Island, the ****in' Noo Yawker has the uncanny talent of injecting the fact that they're from the NYC area into just about every conversation. They complain about just about every aspect of their college town, saying that it's inferior in some way to NYC. \"You can't get a good bagel at 3:00 on a Sunday morning!\" \"The pizza here sucks!\" They'll even take positive traits of their new surroundings and turn that into a negative - \"The subway here in Washington is too clean! It's not a real ****in' subway like in Noo Yawk, with litter, bums, rats, the smell of **** and ****. That's real, not this sanitized Metro rail **** where they won't even let you eat a ****ing pastrami on rye!\"\n\nWALK SLOWER THAN GRANDMA PERSON\n\nOften in groups of two or three they will stretch out in a line and walk slower than an old person with a walker. Also known to hog sidewalks force other students use the grass.\n\nTHE SUBURBAN RAPPER\n\nThe Suburban Rapper can be found in any common area, listening to his own music on his IPOD at an unreasonable volume. Generally (but not always) white, he awkwardly uses the words Dog, Crib, Homie, Phat, G, or Ill. If he spots you, he'll ask you to \"peep this new track yo,\" or attempt to sell you tickets to his half-assed concert. His music is generally unbearable, and if you're lucky, you can get away with only hearing a few verses. He always seems surprised that his poser antics never land him a girl, or a record deal.\n\nACTIVIST ANNIE\n\nSomewhat related to the man-hating feminist but has plenty more to **** her off than just men. Needs to get involved in every civil rights or ultra liberal campaign that has ever been mentioned on campus. Tries to make a cause out of every problem anybody has with authority, no matter how absurd or completely unfounded the complaint.\n\nYOU\u0092RE A LITTLE TOO OLD TO BE HERE GUY\n\nUsually in the 28-32 year range, this species refuses to let go of the joys of college. Can be found on campus seven days a week, and is always present at EVERY SINGLE FRAT PARTY. Will give you some lame, shady excuse why he\u0092s still in college, and will then befriend you so he can abuse the T1 connection in your dorm room to download porn. Most often has no friends his own age, is unemployed and still lives with his parents. Because he is older than everyone else, he will constantly criticize everyone for acting like children, but will then throw a tantrum when you won\u0092t let him play a game of HALO. You can recognize him by his weird and outdated taste in clothing and his fondness for 80\u0092s rock music. Usually very loud, obnoxious and opinionated in the classroom, with traits similar to that of THE EXAM BEGGER and THE INTELLECTUAL SUPERHERO.\n\nTHE EXAM BEGGER\n\nThis person cannot take a test without first begging for as much review or information as possible. They cannot prepare for a test without first knowing seemingly unimportant details like \"How many questions are on this test?\" They will beg for extra review sessions, extra credit, and to know the exact breakdown of how the test is scored. They will waste the whole class when a test is announced if the professor doesn't shut them up. They will also spend the entire first session of a class, when the syllabus is presented trying to make homework a much higher percentage of the total grade.\n\nBIBLE SLUT\n\nGenerally starts out being the CONVERTER, straight-laced and conservative; they go to church every week and brag about that fact often. This person even has the ability to recite any and every bible verse from memory. Then THE LUCKY **** or JOHNNY THREE LEGS introduces them to the marvels of SEX,and it's all down hill from there, as they descend into the foul pits of whoredom. They of course will still go to Church every week in order to keep up a facade of piety, singing the glories of baby Jesus.\n\nTHE BABYFACE\n\nThis kid graduated high school early, but doesn't really make a big deal about it. Because of this, his social skills are somewhat undeveloped, and he is quick to attach himself to social groups in order to gain acceptance. Said social groups are quick to make him the subject of their corruption projects, and take great pleasure in getting him drunk/laid/stoned for the first time.\n\nTHE AMICABLE ATHLETE\n\nSort of the polar opposite of the Hillbilly Gangster, the Amicable Athlete is usually about 6 foot three, weighing in at 225 pounds, and looks like Sam Jackson on steroids. Attending college on a sports scholarship, the Amicable Athlete probably works a cushy job at a car dealership, gets more tail than you can possibly imagine, is more or less constantly high on primo weed all of the time, and is smart enough to know that he's in for an easy ride and to enjoy it and throws great parties! While he might never turn pro, there's a good chance he'll get a good gig on the local AM sports radio station\n\nTHE STAREDOWN-ER\n\nIf this kid is corrected by another student on anything, no matter how wrong they were, and how right the corrector was, his wrath shall be incurred in the most passive-aggressive manner possible: Silently glowering at their new 'nemesis'. No matter if the incident occurred once, months ago, any time you look in this kid's general direction, he will still be ****ing staring at you with the hatred of a thousand warlords. Will probably lead the victim of his piercing gaze to do a number of 'Is he still ****ing staring at me?' checks.\n\nTHE WHITE RASTAFARIAN\n\nAll of his tie-dyed clothes are made from, like, pure natural hemp, man! He most likely sports an impressive set of dreadlocks and can be easily spotted as he skateboards to his next class. The White Rasta can also be found playing an odd game called 'hackey sack' along with others of his kind in any park-like area, or any place that has a couple of trees nearby, and seem to have an affinity for border collies and other shaggier members of the species canine. They also seem to possess an almost MacGuyver-like ability to create a bong from a combination of nearly any common household objects within a matter of moments.\n\nTHE NEWLY-RIPE FRUIT\n\nThis guy's gay! You see, he's only just found out and now he's got to make up for lost time. He may have had a healthy interest in sports, or board games - but no more. He tries, for the sake of decorum, to occasionally talk about things that do not directly involve his gayness, but he is unequal to the struggle and five or six minutes down the line, the increasingly one-sided conversation has shifted to his multiple **** buddies, or one of his alarmingly variegated fetishes. You see, just liking ***** isn't enough - that's not gay enough for the Newly-Ripe Fruit to truly express himself. He must round his sexuality out with public discussion of whips or chains or **** drinking, but more often than not he decides he is a furry as well, and won't let it escape anyone's notice. Possibly does more to set back the cause of tolerance than Fred Phelps ever did.\n\nTHE NURSING STUDENT\n\nOMG BUSY! These girls (invariably) are incredibly busy with their nursing school workload. Despite this, they get **** faced constantly with their fellow nursing school students, only to wake up at 5am for their OB rotation. Often incredibly attractive, these girls typically are still attached to the same guy they knew in high school, who they will marry.\n\nTHE CAVE DWELLER\n\nHis blinds are never open. His light's never on. He lives by the light of his computer. Whenever he goes out, which is very, very rare, he squints and looks frightened, often power walking to class. He uses the internet for his lectures, and never sleeps when you do, so you can't hang out with your friends/girlfriend at your place. He's not nice, but he's not mean. He's clean, but his room's a mess. There's Mountain Dew cans everywhere. He gets average grades, and he's usually a science major, though sometimes a Lit or English major.\n\nMUSCLES MCFLAUNTY\n\nThis individual (almost always a guy) has been lifting weights since age 4, and never lets you forget about it. He goes to the gym twice a day, wears nothing more covering than a wife beater, and constantly twitches his pecs just to get you to look at his chest. McFlaunty may or may not be otherwise annoying, but it is a known fact that he eats creatine for breakfast, lunch and dinner to increase muscle mass even further; this will result in four different cancers before he is 30. Occasionally, Muscles McFlaunty will have a lisp, in which case, laugh at him.\n\nMRS. DEGREE\n\nMisses degree has no real purpose in college except finding \"Mr. Degree\" majoring in some lucrative field such as computer programming, premed, law, or engineering. Often packed with great looks, a killer body and half a brain Mrs. Degree has no problem being a mere shadow of their wealthy husband and is always the first to brag and attempt to start \"intelligent conversation\" on the career of Mr. Degree. Always on the prowl, you may find Mrs. Degree befriending such characters as the Study Nazi, ****ING DISGUSTING C.S. MAJOR, and the CEO Junior.\n\nSOCIAL DISORDER GUY\n\nAvoided by everyone, this person possess a crippling social tic that goes completely unnoticed to him. If you're unlucky enough to be identified by social disorder guy in public, you will be followed regardless of how much of a hurry you pretend to be in. You will be forced, due to social etiquette, to engage in a meaningless and awkward conversation that will be filled with characterizations of your self image. Social Disorder Guy is completely comfortable stopping on his way to work for fifteen minutes or half an hour to fill you in on one of two things: either his roommate is moving out again or he has a new job. You have no classes with him, and you never see him except for random times during the day around your campus, yet he considers you one of his best friends. You probably are.\n\nTHE ANSWER MACHINE\n\nThis person gets it! They understand the material. They can answer the hard questions that require logical induction and they can form arguments using the material.\nUnfortunately, everyone else in the class is either the Quiet, Smart Slacker or The Frat Mattress or I'm Too Important to Be Here. The professor lectures and asks a question and no one will answer. Grated by the awkward silence, The Answer Machine finally answers.\n\nThe floodgates open. From the rest of the semester onwards, the class is a dialogs between The Answer Machine and the professor interspersed with infrequent, sometimes mind-numbing comments from The Frat Mattress when she's called on and the slacker when they care. But for the most part, it's The Answer Machine. Even when they don't answer, the professor will call on them regardless of whether or not their hand is raised.\n\nTHE MEGAPHONE\n\nThis guy seems pretty intelligent and contributes with a vast amount of knowledge. Unfortunately he has got no grasp of volume at all. Will scream across the room with a content smile on his face while embarrassing the people around him. When conversing with The Megaphone you can't decide if he is constantly pulling your leg or just doesn't realize what the hell he is telling you. Does never know when to shut up but magically manages to never **** anyone seriously off.\n\nTHE GEEK PROVIDER\n\nThe provider tends to be everyone's best friend when they need something from him. Of his various requests, he spends the majority of his time lofting and unlofting bunks, or fixing people's computers. When he is not doing this, the provider is somehow nowhere to be found. For extra fun, combine THE PROVIDER with the FOREIGN SILENT CURVE DESTROYER\n\nMR. ROTC CADET\n\nOften seen traversing campus in fatigues, yet his pack is devoid of water, map, GPS, or other survival gear. Instead, he packs the same Biology 101, Spanish II, and English Rhetoric texts that you do. Known to major in Criminology or Criminal Justice, and may show up to 8 a.m. class in PT gear, not having had time to make it home for a shower and shave after his morning run. Placed by God on Earth to counter the ramblings of Passionate Politico with physical threats (if PP is a male) or ramblings of his own stripping PP of her human/constitutional rights (if PP is a female). Very loyal to his friends and beliefs, Mr. ROTC Cadet is generally a good guy to have as a friend, or at least an amiable acquaintance.\n\nMR. I WORK FULL TIME\n\nThis guy uses his job as an excuse not to show up and help with group projects. He will claim that he must work all the time and therefore cannot show up for any of the group meetings. Impossible to get hold of outside of class. Generally a 50/50 shot of doing the work.\n\nMUSIC MAJOR\n\nOne of the more rare species outside of Music Classes, Practice Rooms, and University Symphony Concerts. The MM spends 50% of their time practicing, 25% studying hard/semi-useless classes which require an A to get accepted to their low-paying major, 25% at band practices, and 25% with their music Fraternity/Sorority...is that 125%? Doesn't matter; MMs party so much that the high alcohol content in their bloodstream causes them to black out and loose that 25%. Tends to only date other music majors because \"Only another MM can understand why they have to practice 3-4 hours a day\". Depending on the instrument, music majors are laid back, but complain that they are working SOOO hard to eventually get a salary of <$35K a year but that \"I love music SOOO much it doesn't matter\". Usually makes fun of the Drama Nerd for not being \"Real Musicians\" and has enough Classical CD's to fill up Amazon.com.\n\nFACEBOOK ADDICT\n\nThe Facebook Addict often makes references to who changed/added what, and who \"its complicated\" with who. Most of their sentences begin with \"omg did u see _______ on his/her wall?\" and end with \"Tag it!\" They check facebook every chance they get, only to get ****ed when they dont have a new wall post from when they last checked it 18 seconds ago. They are amazed by those who mini-feed say they have \"no recent activity\" and how they have such self control. The FACEBOOK ADDICT often joins many groups and is only moments away from becoming the FACEBOOK ZOMBIE.\n\nTHE STUDIO ART MAJOR:\n\nThe S.A.M. totes around a humongous portfolios (often containing works of art only other S.A.M.'s can appreciate) manages to whack near passersby's and destroy other objects in their path. The studio major whine's about spending all their money on ridiculously expensive studio supplies, yet they have enough for a regular smoke...you know, for the stress. Unfortunately, studio courses are inhumanely time-consuming, so the S.A.M. are almost always held up in the studio labs, yet the degree is absolutely worthless, thus resulting in a downward mental spiraling of the said major students. You could spot them easily by their odd sense of \"fashion\", consisting of articles such as striped socks, ripped jeans and unsightly hairstyles. The best way to test if an individual is a studio arts major is to ask him/her to help you count, as most can't do math to save their lives.\n\nINTELLECTUAL SUPERHERO\n\nIntellectual Superhero is neither an intellectual nor a superhero, but don\u0092t tell him that! The Intellectual Superhero is easily identified by his complete inability to allow a class period to pass by without asking at least 654 questions designed to show how \"witty\" and \"clever\" he is. He will attempt to prove the professor wrong in every class with his inane ********, regardless of the fact that the professor has a doctorate in the field. If it\u0092s a science course, the Intellectual Superhero will attempt to solve every problem using an alternate method, which is always incorrect. But don\u0092t worry; he\u0092ll still manage to waste 20 minutes of your life with his insane method of solving the problem. At least you\u0092ll get to laugh at him when the professor proves him wrong.\n\nTHE FACE BOOK ZOMBIE\n\nThis person comes to class every single time, yet spends 100% of class time on their laptop. They believe that if one comes to class, one will somehow absorb the material telepathically from the professor. They usually are on Face book, Forums (Many are Goons) Some sort of RPG, Solitaire, you name it. The important thing, though, is that they are not paying attention to class at all, Ever. They tend to hover in the back, and have ultra quick minimizing reflexes if a lone TA should wander back there.\n\nTHE ETHNIC TREASURE\n\nComes from a multi-ethnic back ground, and will constantly bring this up. They will write articles in the school paper about how delightfully confused they are about not knowing which ethnic stereotypes to conform to.\n\nTHE \"GARY\"\n\nUsually an unattractive guy who thinks he is a stud and acts like he is hung like a porn star. Thinks he can charm and seduce any woman by lecherously rubbing her back and give back massages while trying to undo her bra. Always touching up girls even if they give the message they are not interested, even in front of their boyfriend. But thats cool, he has a black belt in Karate so will be ready to fight off any ****ed boyfriends. Carries a pair of handcuffs with him and loves to put girls through bondage in the pub even if they don't want it.\n\nTHEY LIVE AT THE COFFEE SHOP\n\nIt might be an on-campus coffee shop or one right near campus, but either way they're there. Always. The group can get quite large, but there's a core of about four people. Usually this core consists of: a fat, annoying girl; a gay guy; a theater major (male or female); and an older guy, either a grad student/limpet or a townie. This core group will invariably occupy the coffee shop's only couch; if there are more than one, they will occupy the best couch. No matter where you are in the coffee shop, you will hear them laughing, shouting, calling one another hot, singing along with the song playing on the stereo (\"omigod i luv this song!!\"), and erupting into a chorus of \"BYEEEE's\" whenever one of the group finally decides to leave.\n\n45 YEAR OLD COLLEGE STUDENT WITH 2 KIDS\n\nThe 45 Year Old College Student with Two Kids is one of the more interesting persona's found in the college classroom. This subject has returned to school in an attempt to better her life, which is a great endeavor. However, there are a few things about this person that will make you want to punch her in the face by the end of the semester. The 45-year-old college student with two kids must write down every word the professor says. This will cause the class to be peppered with calls of \"can you repeat that\" approximately every 0.23 seconds. Second, she must ask the most obvious questions, preferably ones the professor has already answered.\n\nTHE FLEETING LOVEBIRDS\n\nComprised mainly of Freshman, these two are fresh out of high school, and are gonna be in love forever. They take all the same classes together, they've got their first apartment together, and they're inseparable. Most of the time, one of the two had the chance to a scholarship at a better school, but turned it down in the name of love. They'll sit together in class, are always the first to volunteer for group work together, and will no doubt be broken up by the end of their first year.\n\nTHE NIGHT OWL\n\nStaying up long after you've gone to bed, a Night Owl roommate may periodically awaken you with a laughing fit after reading a Chuck Norris joke on some crappy forum or heating water in the microwave for a 3 AM cup of ramen. May be seen complaining about the lack of places open in town at 1 in the morning on Tuesday night. The Night Owl is also likely to skip morning classes.\n\nTHE GUY/GIRL WITH INHUMAN HALO SKILLS\n\nThis person doesn't have \"mad skills\"; Instead, there is no word in the English language that properly describes how good this ****er is with a plasma rifle or pistol. They look rather ordinary, with no unusual physical features, nor obvious personality quirks. But give em' an Xbox, and a copy of Halo, and prepare to have many recurring nightmares of what you're about to see. They quite literally can chuck a grenade at a difficult-to-reach weapon, and the explosion will launch the said weapon straight at em', as if they was pulling it telekineticaly. They knows the location of every item on every map, and knows exactly when that item is gonna respawn.\n\nSTUPID UGLY FAT GIRL\n\nStupid Ugly Fat Girl feels the need to enter into every single class discussion, completely disregarding the fact that she has nothing of substance to add to the conversation. Stupid Ugly Fat Girl cannot construct a sentence without using the words \"like\" and \"um\" at least 12 times for every 2 other words. She always wears clothes that are too tight, and seems partial to gaudy rhinestone shirts with incredibly original phrases such as \"Princess\" strewn across the front of her sagging cow tits. The only way to actually learn something in a class with the Stupid Ugly Fat Girl is to distract her attention with a shiny object.\n\nTHE ONE UPPER\n\nThis student will make it a point to one-up anything that comes out of anyone\u0092s mouth. You study for a test for 6 hours? He studied for 10. You drank 12 beers? He drank 20. You've broken your arm twice? He's broken his 3 times. The interesting thing to note about the One-Upper is the fact that everything he says is a lie, but he has convinced himself its true.\n\nSMALL TOWN GODDESS\n\nHails from some microscopic town where she maybe had 5 or 6 classmates in her graduating class, the Small Town Goddess is what is known as HOT. SMOKING HOT, in fact. Like, all-natural, blonde haired and blue-eyed 1973-ish Playboy bunny-like hotness. However, for some reason unknown to science, she somehow did not develop what is commonly known as 'Hot Chick Syndrome' and is, instead, incredibly sweet, good natured and friendly to a fault. This, naturally, causes most members of the opposite sex to be baffled by this seemingly incongruous behavior. Many a man have approached her, yet few can stand to be around her for very long. Why, you ask? The fault lies not with her, oh dear reader! Nay, the fault comes from realizing that she is honestly squeaky clean and you, by comparison, are like some filthy hobo in your soul.\n\nJOHNNY FRAT BOY - or - SALLY SORORITY CHICK\n\nWhile there\u0092s certainly nothing wrong with being in a Greek organization, some people take their involvement in these groups a little too seriously. These are the people who can\u0092t go 2 consecutive days without wearing their shirts from some drinking party they went to last weekend. Johnny Frat Boy likes to brag about how many beers he slammed down on Tuesday night, while Sally Sorority Chick acts as though she is too immaculate to be tarnished by your presence. In either case you shouldn\u0092t worry about these two personality types too much because they only associate with each other. This brings me to another point: when you see these people outside of class, it is perfectly acceptable to run them over with your motor vehicle of choice.\n\nSTUDY NAZI\n\nStudy Nazi is in school for one reason: to get good grades. Unfortunately for Study Nazi, he\u0092s not that bright and he struggles with his classes. That doesn\u0092t stop him from letting everyone know how long he studied for that 5 question quiz though. Study Nazi, much like the Intellectual Superhero, will ask questions constantly during class. However, the Intellectual Superhero has some grasp of the material. Study Nazi, while he can quote his books and his notes verbatim, has no idea what any of it means. Under no circumstances should you approach Study Nazi outside of class. Doing so will only remind him that he\u0092s losing valuable time that he could be using in the library and you might get hurt in his frenzied dash to get there as quickly as possible.\n\nTHE KARAOKE SUPERSTAR:\n\nPossessing the incredible ability of knowing the lyrics to every song ever written, but unfortunately lacking the talent to flaunt it properly, the Karaoke Superstar molds every moment of their life into that of an American Idol reject. Whether it be wailing along to their favorite Nickelback song at the bar, or belting out Phil Collins in the dorm shower at 8 in the morning, the Karaoke Superstar fails to hit the right notes every time. Those in earshot will reel in horror at the audio assault, exclaiming \"Oh my God, a cat fell into the blender!\" or \"It sounds like someone is scraping a cheese grater across 200 feet of blackboard!\" The Karaoke Superstar falls under the category of \"completely ignorant,\" believing their vocal stylings to be those of a professional. Frequently an actual Music major, mentioning their shortcomings will result in a major blow to their ego.\n\nTHE LUCKY ****\n\nAn amorphous presence, he is in your class just to make you feel crappy. He doesn't try, isn't smart, and may even be a mean SOB to people, yet gets lucky breaks in grades/finding a job/getting a girl. For instance he bombs a test but the professor loses it and acknowledges he took the test and gets the class average, or finds an emotionally unstable girl who clings to him and does anything he wants regardless of how he treats her. He also will get a job because of a crappy reason like him and the recruiter like the same baseball player.\n\nTHE BALANCED GUY\n\nThey're a fairly sociable bunch with lots of common sense, and they have fairly diversified skills. These guys seldom try to draw attention to themselves but also have a healthy amount of self-esteem (Balanced Guys generally don't attack/insult people in any way unless they feel it's warranted). They're willing to learn a little about everything and can be found in places such as the gym lifting weights, or even in a kitchen working on their cooking skills... or....sometimes in their room masturbating to a wide variety of downloaded porn clips. Who knows what Balanced Guy will do next. They aren't spendthrifts, but they aren't penny pinchers, either. They play both sports and video games. When it comes to discussions of any sort, balanced guy keeps an open mind and generally takes a politically \"moderate\" stance.\n\nSILENT FOREIGN CURVE DESTROYER\n\nSilent Foreign Curve Destroyer has nothing better to do than study. While the average of the rest of the class is a respectable 45%, Silent Foreign Curve Destroyer has approximately a 1351% in the course, thereby totally destroying any chance you had of passing the class. Silent Foreign Curve Destroyer can be identified by the fact that he will be in the library before you get there and stay far after you've left. He will almost certainly wear the same clothing throughout the entire course, and, while he may be human, it's more likely that he's some kind of magic robot.\n\nTHE CELLPHONE TERRORIST\n\nThe Cellphone Terrorist has the capability to disrupt classes without even being present. They will leave their belongings in class as they go for a bathroom break when, suddenly, the sound of \"My Humps\" fills the room. Yes, that's The Cellphone Terrorists new ring tone for this week and it isn't going to stop until they return. Those unfortunate enough to be sitting beside The Cellphone Terrorist will hang their head in shame as piercing gazes are shot directly their way.\n\nUpon return, The Cellphone Terrorist will usually check their missed calls and proceed to call said person back by means of a covert coat-over-the-head technique that they have perfected.\n\n****ING DISGUSTING C.S. MAJOR\n\n****ing Disgusting Computer Science Major is the reason that you don\u0092t want to go to class. He bathes roughly once every leap year and wears the same \"totally awesome\" Japanese video game (the import version was so much better) shirt for half a semester at a time. No matter how far away you get from him, the stench seems to travel across the room and assault your nostrils. ****ing Disgusting Computer Science Major has no time for the English language, and he will often ask questions that make little to no sense and lack any sort of \"grammatical structure.\" He\u0092s the only character that can actually give Silent Foreign Curve Destroyer a run for his money on the intellectual scale, but that\u0092s only because he was probably born with knowledge of linear algebra and differential equations.\n\nAGENDA ASSAILER\n\nThe Agenda Assailer has (surprise!) an agenda to push on everyone else. If you\u0092re in, say, a science class you\u0092ll get to hear about how the scientist who discovered some principle was a racist or misogynist and therefore his scholarly work is somehow meaningless. Even though the rest of the class is just there to learn, the Agenda Assailer will attempt to turn every class into a political debate. Here\u0092s an example from a history class:\nquote:\nProfessor: Thomas Jefferson wrote the Declaration of Independence.\nAA: How can you even SAY that?!?!?!?! He owned slaves!!!\nProfessor: Well, yes. But he still wrote it.\nAA: Well then he\u0092s a hypocrite and we should THROW OUT the Declaration of Independence!!!\n\nTHE VISIBLE MINORITY\n\nHe's the only one in your class, sometimes he makes sure that everyone knows it. Most of the time he's pretty cool tough, you just need to get to know them better. Excels at making you feel bad about random comment you make on his people.\n\nTHE ANIME FREAK\n\nAnime Freak is somewhat of a rarity outside of computer science and/or Japanese courses. However, you still might encounter one in some humanities cores. The Anime Freak will always be wearing button down shirts with a dragon or some kind of Dragonball Z character on it. Also, anything with Japanese writing on it is always cool in the eyes of Anime Freak, even if it makes absolutely no sense. Do not approach the Anime Freak outside of class, unless you want to run into a situation like this:\nquote:\nYou: Hey, what\u0092s up?\nAF: I think episode 185 of [insert horribly obscure anime show here] is the best because they use the Power of the Light to slay the dragon beast and save the world from total destruction!!!\nYou: Um\u0085 I have to go.\n\nTHE ENGINEER\n\nOne who is rarely seen without a TI-83 Plus or higher model calculator, and actually knows how to, and does, use all the functions of said calculator. Often makes jokes that one outside of the Engineering spectrum will not understand, or makes really horrible ones, or both. Example: \"I'm pretty sure it was a zero-force member...\" \"that's what she said.\" Takes many science/math courses that are said to \"strongly relate to core Engineering\" and \"provide a base for higher level courses\" but in reality 99% of skills in said classes are rarely used.\n\nMAJOR ELITIST\n\nMajor Elitist is generally some type of science or engineering major who looks down on anyone who might even think about getting a humanities or business degree. After all, we all know that the only thing that\u0092s important is science. All that other mamby-pansy ******** like \"History\" or \"English\" or \"the world economy\" is just a bunch of feel-good rhetorical nonsense anyway. Besides, any jackass can get a liberal arts degree!\n\nNON-CONFORMIST CONFORMIST\n\nThe Non-Conformist Conformist is an interesting species. While he tries to \"fight the man,\" he is unable to do so without conforming to another group. The Non-Conformist Conformist can be easily identified by his Rage Against the Machine or Che Guevara t-shirt and dark green corduroy pants. During the winter he will be wearing a military field coat from Germany with a patch on the side, and he often carries a wallet on a chain. You can identify him in the classroom because he\u0092ll feel the need to share with the class his opinions of pop culture. He\u0092ll use a condescending tone of voice because he\u0092s better than little sheep like you. That\u0092s all right though because whether it be the punk, goth, or any other subculture, the Non-Conformist Conformist declares boldly, \"I choose to not fit in by fitting in with a DIFFERENT group!\"\n\nFASHION MONGER\n\nFashion Monger is on the bleeding edge of fashion! While having some nice clothes is something everyone should invest in, Fashion Monger\u0092s entire wardrobe has been purchased from stores so hip that you've never even heard of them. Apparently, it\u0092s \"hip\" and \"with it\" to pay 500 dollars for jeans that were hand stitched by the hardworking people of Taiwan. And, as we all know, 50 dollars for a silk-screened t-shirt is a completely reasonable price, as long as it was designed by an gay Italian man. Yes, nothing says, \"I have too much money and not enough common sense\" quite like buying clothes with fancy designer labels that are marked up 1000%\n\nTHE SOCIABLE SLACKER\n\nThis is the guy who went out of his way to talk to you on the first day. Was really personable, seems like a normal, social person. He even suggested trading phone numbers just in case you needed help. Fast forward to the second week of class - he's not there. Same goes for all the classes until right before the midterm when you get a call. \"Hey man, what's up? How's it going? Oh yeah, I missed the last class can I borrow all your notes and photocopy them? Yeah, we should go grab a beer one day.\" No show again until the final where he calls you up again asking for notes. And that beer? A complete fabrication.\n\nPARADISE LOST\n\nSmart, sheltered kid with a childhood full of religious superstition and intimacy issues. Finally gets into a relationship (aka LAID) and gets suicidal when the breakup comes a few months later. Will either hang himself in the woods or emerge as an improved species. Flip a coin.\n\nCEO JUNIOR III\n\nBorn to wealth and privilege and toting an ego the size of Australia, CEO Jr. III will rarely be encountered outside of econ, business and business-related courses (like the lower level computer sciences). Much like the Fashion Monger, CJ3 is fascinated by brand names and drops them wherever possible. However, instead of dropping \"real\" designer names, he'll brag about the cheap **** he bought from Abercrombie last week. Success is what he's aiming for, and he'll probably get there, but only through his dad\u0092s business connections. Like the Study Nazi, he is not particularly bright, though his particular mode of achieving good grades consists of stroking the professor's ego with appropriate questions and office hours schmoozing. Like the Sociable Slacker he is unfailingly cheerful, but his cheeriness, much like everything else about him, is completely insincere. He is astoundingly successful at getting laid for reasons which are at present unknown to science. It's probably best to avoid crossing him in social circumstances since he can wield his people skills like a weapon.\n\nTHE SKIMMER\n\nThe skimmer is easy to identify. He always sits in the back of lecture halls and is usually asleep 10 minutes into class. It is not uncommon to hear The Skimmer brag about how much studying he didn't do for that quiz coming up. The Skimmer is not usually found in higher level courses.\n\nTHE SCOUT\n\nThe Scout is always in lecture before you. Even if you show up five minutes early. The Scout will use his backpack, notebook, textbook, or anything larger than a piece of paper to cordon off the entire front row for his or her friends, who show up five minutes after the class has already started.\n\nTHE PHANTOM\n\nA completely unremarkable student in every way, THE PHANTOM shows up for classes, does the work, and... that's it. You will never see THE PHANTOM outside of class - Existing on his sheepishness and fueled by his silence, even if you live next door to THE PHANTOM you'll never hear a word of him, sometimes can be combined with ****ing Disgusting Computer Science Major for a truly wholesome experience.\n\nFORMER MILITARY SERVICEMAN\n\n\"Well, when I was in Iraq ...\"\nAnd basically media misrepresentation is the cause of virtually everything bad in society these days.\n\nVALLEY GIRL\n\nWomen who appear to be made entirely from bronzed plastic, with lips glossy enough to successfully buff the floor of a shopping mall. Don't bother remembering any of their names, as one valley girl is completely indiscernible from the next. Often seen courting Ugly *******s.\n\nJOHNNY THREE LEGS\n\nUsually an average-looking, somewhat lanky guy, Johnny Three Legs is extraordinary on one respect: his ten inch *****. Flaccid. How do you know? Well, he's the guy that faces towards everyone else in communal showers. In dorms with individual showers, he dries himself off in public areas, and spends just a bit more time naked than other residents, who usually whip on a towel before they even draw the curtains open. Pity his poor roommate, usually a lonely computer science major that is still a virgin, who is kept up awake at nights from the cries of Johnny Three leg's dates - \"Ouch! That hurts! Ungggnmph! Oh yeah ... yes ... God ... OUCH! Let's try it another way .... yes ... oh God ... oh Jesus ... OUCH!\"\n\nMADDEN JR.\n\nThis student's life revolves around sports. He can quote sports scores, character stats, and just about anything from some obscure game last week. Not only did he watch it, he studied it while his classmates were studying for that quiz he failed. He usually arrives in class approximately 10 minutes late wearing his favorite sports team hat and jacket, only to talk about sports for the entire class. Interestingly, the Madden Jr. rarely, if ever, has any athletic ability of his own, and is often obese due to a diet consisting entirely of nachos.\n\nTHE PREMED\n\nThe pre-med has a 4.0 cumulative GPA and has junior standing even though he's a first semester sophomore. He's got a >90 average in every class this semester, but is absolutely terrified that he's going to fail them all. Can often be heard making wild assumptions about grading schemes and arguing with the TA over 0.25 point deductions on exams.\n\nBRING ME UP, KNOCK ME DOWN\n\nHe is always there to help. Whatever jam you have yourself in, he will, with ease, find a way to pull you out. However, he will do so with so much reluctance, he makes it sound as though Sisyphus (look it up) had an easy go of things. He will passive aggressively start conversations about what a drag it is being the designated driver, only days after he drove your drunk ass home.\n\nHe is the infinite conundrum of friendship. He is always there for you. Unfortunately he is always there.\n\nBABBLING IDIOT\n\nThis kid is sort of like intellectual superhero except that he's not really out to prove a point through questions, but rather through his personal experiences. He is in class to spill as many anecdotes as he can possibly think of, which, for the most part, only relate to the subject at hand tangentially. His diatribes are voiced in an overly sincere tone, which I'm sure he believes makes his stories sound more real, true to life, and hard hitting. Amazingly, his stories always tend to agree with the professor's point of view.\n\nTHE WANNA BE COMPUTER GEEK\n\nThey can be found in groups often discussing old internet fads while downloading songs and files from P2P networks. Often annoying to the people around them. Will shout out \"LOL INTERNETS\" at random times and you can hear some old techno songs in the background.\n\nTHE COMMENTER\n\nTends to occupy the center of the room for maximum visibility. Always nods along with the professor. Provides his/her own commentary, largely to herself, during lecture while jotting down notes. Most commonly uttered phrases are variations of: \"Oh yeah\", \"Exactly\", \"Well, that's interesting\".\n\nExample:\nProf.: DNA is blueprint for life.\nComm.: [Nod] [Nod] Uh-huh. Well, ain't that something\n\nVACATION GUY\n\nThis guy didn't want to go to college in the first place, but did because he didn't want to disappoint his parents and teachers by not trying. So he picked a party school, never went to class, and treated the whole thing as a $40,000, year long, spring break away from ****ty middle class suburbia. Then disappeared to a distant part of the country never to be heard from again.\n\nTHE BLONDE ASIAN TAMER\n\nFemale in a science degree who probably shouldn't be. However, due to chemicals she emits from her hair, holds sway over Silent Foreign Curve Destroyer or other male Asian students who do her beck and call. Part hive mind, part parasite. Identify by remarks like \"This stuff is so hard, Haji, you're so smart\" or \"What did you get for number 1?\". Usually a sub-species of Sally Sorority Chick\n\nThe PASSIONATE POLITICO\n\nWhatever wing of the political bird he resides within he'll be damned sure to inject his angry rhetoric and sound bites into any classroom conversation regardless of topic. Often twitchy you can spot an outburst before it happens by looking for a grimaced mouth, spasming eye, tapping foot or softly pounding fist (because he thinks no one will notice), then out comes the insanity.\n\nMR. UNCERTAINTY\n\nMr. Uncertainty isn't really that bad a guy to have class with, as he's virtually guaranteed never to disrupt the class proceedings. Even when the teacher asks him a question directly, he'll attempt to deflect it through a magical combination of stuttering, fumbling, and vague sentences that trail off in the middle. He probably doesn't take very good notes, but he's there every day in hopes of making up for the fact. He probably has at least two majors and a third concentration that he's considering, but it's all perpetually up in the air since he doesn't really know what he wants to do. Because of this, you'll almost never see him in an advanced-level class, since he's always going back and satisfying the core requirements for a different major.\n\nPROFESSOR CORRECTOR\n\nThis student loves to volunteer class time to correct the professors' menial mistakes. Did he say 90% instead of 85%? Was he off an important date by a year? The Corrector will grab this opportunity immediately. Does the textbook back up the professor? Well that's wrong too! The whole world is filled with misinformation, and only this noble lad can spend 20 minutes setting the professor straight as everyone silently whispers \"I HATE YOU.\" They may be a student, but they already years ahead of the class.\n\nOBNOXIOUS CAR DRIVER\n\nPulling out of the parking deck at the speed limit while letting pedestrians cross will not fly while the OCD is around. Loud tire screeching, revving, horn honking, and blasted music must be accompanied at even the slowest street. They will outrace and outmaneuver vans in 20 mph zones. They will rev their engine to make sure they reach the stop sign 20 feet away fast enough. Their car is modified to maximize every scrape, screech and scratch to its highest volumes. If it's not unnecessarily loud, they are not driving.\n\nDRAMA NERD\n\nOften found roaming (or more often loafing) in packs of 4 to 7, the drama nerd is best known for not shutting the **** up ever and oh god i mean ever regarding new musicals, old musicals, how non-theater majors are intellectually devoid of any redeeming quality, who got cast where, etc. The drama nerd is mostly self-delusional, and if one is to ask it about it's past, the response often involves \"well you know I just had the WORST time in high school i mean nobody understood me there but when I got to college I just felt like a BUTTERFLY, able to finally open my creative WINGS\" and other such inane metaphors. The Drama nerd does, somehow, get laid all the goddamn time, but only by other Drama nerds, resulting in chain-reaction mega-drama-bombs that will certainly resonate throughout the school because these losers will not shut up about how Johnny Actor face \"TOTALLY USED ME\" at high volumes in the library during finals week. Somehow possessing both the largest and smallest reserve of self-confidence of any college student simultaneously, ladies and gentlemen: the Drama Nerd.\n\nTHE CONVERSATIONALIST\n\nYou'll find this one at the back of the class, and they tend to travel in herds. She spends all semester having conversations with the people around her, that have absolutely nothing to do with the class, usually pertaining to her boyfriend, a movie she just saw, or a party she was at/plans to attend. Completely ignorant of the people around her who are actually trying to pay attention to the lecture in a typically difficult subject. Another common trait of The Conversationalist is her apparent lack of any sort of school supplies (including pens, pencils, paper, and the freaking textbook) Sociologists have theorized that this is a subconscious ploy designed to draw more people into The Conversationalist's tangled web of distraction.\n\nTHE FACULTY MEMBER\n\nThis is a student who has become very involved and uses his major as a replacement for a social life. He may, or may not work in the department office, but you'll see him wandering around the office anyway, chatting up the actual faculty. Maybe having lunch in the waiting area. He's only annoying when you actually have a class with him and he takes on the role of a teaching assistant.\n\nTHE JACKASS OF ALL TRADES\n\nThis man is seemingly adept in all subjects, and will boast about it too. Hear him complain about how easy his last Abstract Algebra exam was, how he wrote his African paper two hours before its due and how little he prepared for his sociology presentation. His weakness is poor social skills. Ask about his girlfriend for massive emotional baggage!\n\nPHILOSOPHER STONER\n\nEasily identifiable by his red eyes, incoherent speech, and the lingering stench of marijuana, the philosopher stoner may or may not be a member of NORML, and probably won't go to class very often. On the off chance that he actually attends a class, god forbid the professor mention anything related to drugs, because suddenly the philosopher stoner will turn into a walking, talking version of erowid.com.

Assume this paragraph came from the body of an SAT essay.  Without reading the entire essay, or even knowing the content of the prompt to which the essay was written as a response, please give the paragraph a score from one to six using what you believe are the criteria used by the College Board.  If you have a copy of the College Board blue book, take a moment first to skim a few random paragraphs within several of the sample essays to refresh your sense of the CB\u0092s grading before you grade this paragraph.  Note that you are not grading this essay for accurate historical content, but rather for writing mastery.\n\n\"In the 1930s, American businesses were locked in a fierce economic competition with Russian merchants for fear that their communist philosophies would dominate American markets.  As a result, American competition drove the country into an economic depression and the only way to pull them out of it was through civil cooperation.  American President Franklin Delanor Roosevelt advocated for civil unity despite the communist threat of success by quoting \"the only thing we need to fear is fear itself,\" which desdained competition as an alternative to cooperation for success.  In the end, the American economy pulled out of the Depression and succeeded Communism.\"\n\n\nThis paragraph is a portion of an essay written by a student who was trained to write an essay and submit it for grading as part of a regular SAT test.  The student was a mole.  A spy.  A plant. (The paragraph above was the one paragraph of that essay that appeared in the opening of an article published in Inside Higher Education.  The link to the entire essay given within the article led to an expired page.)\n\nThe professor who trained that student was Dr. Les Perelman, who teaches writing at MIT.  In 2005, Dr. Perlman announced at a writing conference that he had done an analysis of essays evaluated by the College Board as part of the SAT and concluded that he could predict with 92% accuracy what grade an essay would get based exclusively on its length.  Dr. Perlman's claim created quite a stir in the media at the time.  There was an article in the New York Times, he was interviewed on NPR, he spoke at conferences, and media reported his findings across the nation.\n\nI disagree with Dr. Perelman.  I believe there are at least five major holes in his argument as I understand it.  However, I believe there is one point he made that I can agree with wholeheartedly.  On that point, I believe, Professor Perelman hit the bullseye.\n\nMy understanding of Professor Perelman's argument comes from two primary sources.  The first is the transcript of an interview he did May 7, 2005 on NPR's program \"Weekend Edition\" moderated by Linda Wertheimer.  The second was an article that appeared in the magazine \u0091Inside Higher Education\u0092.  That article, which appeared March 26, 2007, was entitled \"Fooling the College Board\".\n\nBetween those two sources I extracted five main points that Perelman made.  The first was that there was a 92% positive correlation between the links of an SAT essay and its score when graded by the College Board.  The second point was that be essay was highly formulaic.  Professor Perelman criticized the five paragraph structure in particular.\n\nThird, Perelman objected to the College Board's acceptance of what he described as \"total disregard for the facts\".\n\nThe fourth point was that the SAT formula \"obliterates\" the writing process.  According to Perelman will \"you are punished for taking time to think.\"  He pointed out that a great deal of the writing process occurs during revision. Perelman noted that college work often requires students to write essays on demand during examinations, but he maintained that those essays are on topics that students have previously studied and considered in-depth.  The SAT essay, however, is entirely extemporaneous.\n\nPerelman\u0092s final point was that the SAT essay was unlike the essays that students would be expected to write in college and was therefore not a good predictor of how students might write after they entered college.\n\nMy criticism of Perelman's position includes all of these points.  I will take them in my own order.\n\nHole number one... Perelman noted that his prediction of grades based on essay length was 92% accurate and concluded that essay length was the relevant factor.  It wasn't.  Length was a natural consequence of other more relevant factors. (I note a rule of logic: correlation does not necessarily indicate causation.)\n\nThe length of an essay is determined by two factors.  First is the number of ideas and second is the number of words used to express those ideas. (I am omitting handwriting.  I note here that both the number and the size of words determine how many pages are filled.  But it is more common that 12 essays are written in average or smaller than average handwriting.  The handwriting is also, more often than not, atrocious.  This is probably because the test-taker is writing like a maniac to get everything down in less than 25 minutes.  In the end, I've chosen to concentrate on the number of words rather than the number of pages because Professor Perelman based his correlations on the number of words in an essay.  The assertion that he could predict the grade of an essay by looking at it from across the room was a bit of an exaggeration, since there is no way at that distance he would be able to determine the number of words.  But I digress.)\n\nPerelman predicted essay grades with 92% accuracy.  The 8% remaining were either short essays that scored well or long essays that didn't. A long essay with few ideas is usually wordy, repetitive and circular.  A short essay with many ideas is usually assertive and unsupported, but it reveals an analysis in depth which is the consequence of an active  intellect.  These constituted Perelman's errors.\n\nHis 92% accuracy rate probably was the result of the more common situation.  That is, students who could only think of a few ideas in response to the prompt generally ran out of things to say earlier than students whose analysis was more complete.  Further, students whose insight and maturity of thought led to a greater number of ideas are generally more mature in their use of language as well, largely as a result of more practice reading and writing, either on the internet or elsewhere.  In short, if their analysis of the prompt was better, it is most likely that their essay was better on all other counts (coherence, sentence structure, vocabulary, etc.) as well.  It seems credible, then, that a longer essay is much more likely to be a better essay.  (More on this at the end of my argument.)\n\nHole number two..... Professor Perelman criticizes the SAT on the grounds that it is not a good predictor of how a student will write in a college classroom.  He objects to the five paragraph format, which he says will require an entire freshman year to be \"deprogrammed\".  He also criticizes the timed format on the grounds that the student is \"punished for taking time to think.\"  His contrast of the SAT essay and the essays students will be expected to write in college examinations fits here is well.\n\nOne problem here is that there are many different kinds of essays and that a competent writer needs to have command of a wide variety of them.  The infamous five paragraph essay is only one kind of essay, but it is not an invalid kind of essay. I think of it as an essay format with training wheels attached.  For a beginning writer the strong structure is perfect for developing a student\u0092s understanding of the variety of kinds and purposes of introductions, the many ways to develop ideas in a body paragraph, and the variety of kinds and purposes of conclusions.  Once the student is equipped with this basic understanding, then the training wheels can be removed and the student is free to take their basic understanding of the elements of an essay in any direction that they wish.\n\nGenerally, this is the point students have reached by the time they're entering college.  That many of those students will still be relying on their five paragraph format at that time, and that many of those students will therefore have to be \"deprogrammed\" during their freshman year is not really so surprising.  If a student has moved beyond that point and mastered many kinds of essays, then the SAT can be viewed as asking such a student to \"give us a number seven today\".\n\nAnother problem, hole number three....  To criticize the SAT because it is not like college writing is to overlook the fact that, if students entered college already writing on the level of college writing, then there would be no purpose for college composition classes.  The SAT essay is not designed to show how well a student will write when they graduate from college, or when they are a junior in college, or when they are a sophomore in college, or even when they are at the end of their freshman year in college.  It is designed to show how well a student is writing when they begin college,\n\nThe essay written to be included with the student's application is another kind of essay written under other circumstances, particularly with regard to the opportunity for revision, but it has the same purpose.  (And I note here that both kinds of essays can be, and most often are, 'gamed' to one degree or another.)\n\nThe fourth hole in Professor Perelman\u0092s argument concerns  the timed format of the essay which \u0093obliterates\u0094 the writing process and \u0093punishes the student for \u0093taking the time to think\u0094.  I agree that revision and preparation are essential parts of the writing process, but I believe Perelman's comparison of the extemporaneous nature of an SAT essay to the essays written in a college professor's blue book exam overlooks a more analogous situation.  I'm referring here to the extemporaneous nature of the responses a student might give in a college entrance interview.  In both cases the questions that students may be asked are expected to be answered within the context of the student's experience of the world in general and not within the context of the student's in-depth study of a particular academic topic.  The student does not have all day to compose and revise answers to the questions asked in an interview and has no specific advanced knowledge of what those questions will be.\n\nThe final hole relates specifically to Perelman's objection that the SAT essay shows \"total disregard for the facts\".  I've addressed this point in other posts.  I hope I'll be forgiven if I indulge in a moment of cutting and pasting.\n\nIn my opinion, there are five pertinent points related to a fictional essay.\n\n1. Your essay is being graded based on criteria related to your ability to write. Your grades in history, political science, biology, psychology etc. will be reflected in the subject area tests. Your essay reader is not likely to be proficient in those areas and will not have the time to fact-check your writing, nor would they want to. Consider that one person's fact is another person's fallacy. Do the Federalist Papers represent the intentions of the framers of the Constitution? Should we take them as our guide today when we deal with Constitutional issues? The SAT essay graders don't desire to deal with issues like that for all 1.5 million different essays they'll read each year, and couldn't if they did. Experienced essay readers will know there is a strong possibility that your essay evidence is fake, but they are unlikely to make an issue of it.\n\n2. What essay readers WILL be looking for is your understanding of the requirements of a good essay. First, they will be looking for your understanding and insight into the issues raised by the essay prompt. Can you analyze those issues? Are your points and sub-points significant and relevant, or are they superficial, obvious and elementary? You can fake the evidence, but you can't fake the analysis. You have to think to do analysis. This involves two things. The first is logic. Logic is logic. It is objective. (If you haven't learned it already, you should know that the rules of formal logic are about HOW you think about propositions, not about whether or not those propositions are actually true.) The second requirement of good analysis is you, more specifically, your experience and understanding of the world and the different kinds of issues and people in it. Does your awareness extend beyond yourself to the larger world around you? The answer to that will show in your analysis.\n\n3. Your analysis leads to your major points and sub-points. Your evidence and explanation of those points come next. Here again, the reader is looking for the quality of your thinking. Are the explanations of your ideas clear and complete? Is your evidence adequate? Again, adequate doesn't mean factual. It means relevant, significant, tied logically to the conclusions you intended the evidence to support. IF the evidence were true, would it be good evidence, logically presented?\n\n4. After the analysis of the issues and the development of your points and evidence, comes the organization, structure and coherence of your writing. Actually, the three elements cited are all aspects of the same thing. They make your writing flow smoothly and logically through your points as the essay proceeds. Introductions, conclusions, transitions, summaries, proportion (the amount of time you spend on each point according to its importance) and unity (everything is related and fits into a single clear idea) are all important here.\n\n5. Finally, the reader checks your writing style. Word choice, sentence structure, grammar and usage, and punctuation are all relevant here. The higher the score, the more relevant they become, but perfection is not required even in a 12 essay. You are writing a first draft, after all.\n\nI hope you can see that factual evidence is not really a requirement for executing a high quality essay. The CB and your reader know that, and can evaluate the essay whether the evidence is true or not. (P.S. GULLIVER\u0092S TRAVELS is not true.  Does that mean it isn\u0092t good writing?)\n\nThere is a final comment that I could make relates to the professor's demonstration of the College Board's incompetence by way of sending his 'mole' into an actual SAT exam, the intention being that said mole would produce an SAT essay designed to be low in quality and high in score.\n\nIt's unfortunate I can't put this paragraph into the context of the entire essay.  (One paragraph of that essay was quoted in full in the opening of the article published in Inside Higher Education. The link to the entire essay given within the article led to an expired page.)\n\nI'm assuming that this paragraph represents one of the examples the mole student used to in support some larger theme, but there really is no way to validate that assumption without reference to the entire original essay.  That having been said, I would still invite the reader to compare this paragraph with the paragraphs given in the sample essays in the College Board blue book.  Remember that the score should not be a reflection of what is expected in college, but rather of what is produced by high school juniors and seniors. What score would you give it?  (I will post the answer after you\u0092ve had a chance to consider the matter and post your scores.)\n\nIn conclusion, I would highlight the point on which Dr. Perelman has my wholehearted agreement.  Too often I\u0092ve read posts by people who want to know the sure-fire formula\nfor a 12 essay.  They want to know prompt archetypes, how many and what kind of examples, how many paragraphs and what to say in the introduction and conclusion.  This is born of the thought that the SAT can be \u0093cracked\u0094, \u0093hacked\u0094, and B.S.ed.  Just learn the secret formula and give those moronic SAT essay readers what they want.\n\nAnd the result is what both Perelman and I detest.  The result is  the formulaic, all to typical Hitler-Gatsby-Say-The-Most-Obvious-Thing-IN-5-Paragraphs-BS-When-You-Haven't-Any-Idea-What-You're-Talking-About-Smartass-Test-Prep-Tutor crap.\n\nHere\u0092s the big secret.  That\u0092s not what the readers want.  They want some significant and original ideas, adequately supported and coherently expressed. They want you to show some genuine personal involvement in what you are saying. That\u0092s what they want, but it\u0092s only very rarely that that\u0092s what they get.\n\nWhat they get is average essay after average essay.  They get 4\u0092s.  Not much to say, not much originality, and lots of formula-written, 5 paragraph essays.  There\u0092s nothing really bad about that, just nothing really good, either.  It\u0092s about average.\n\nYou are getting 4\u0092s and you want a 12?  Here\u0092s the formula.  Recognize that there is a difference between ten years of experience and one year of experience ten times. Get your head out of your own rear and look at the world and the people around you.  Learn about them.  Read about them.  Think about them.  Talk about them.  Do things you haven\u0092t done before. Let new things into your life.  After a year or two of that kind of involvement, you might actually start having some original and significant ideas.  When someone asks you a question about the world, you might even have something intelligent to say.  And that, first and foremost, is what good writing is about: having something worthwhile to say.

If you've got 15-30 minutes to spare (I don't know how long it'll take to read this), try this little student-made guide (I made it) out. If you want a bit of credibility from me, consider the essay that I used as an example in this guide. My English AP class is a fairly tough one, and my teacher isn't exactly an easy grader. I got a 96 on that paper, which I believe was easily the highest grade in my grade (two classes taking the AP English Language and Composition Class). I'm going to explain in detail the writing strategies I've had drilled into my head from my teacher. As I said, I have my 96 essay at the bottom to use as an example, and I described what I did well on that essay.\n\nAs for the essay itself, it touches on some racial issues. I'm not sure what moderators will think of it, but it was based on a book called Huck Finn, which I'm expecting that many other AP English classes probably read. There aren't any opinions taken on racism, it's an essay that analyzes how Twain tells a story. So, the only racial opinion involved comes when I make the conclusion that Twain was opposed racism... that's it. I'm simply speculating on what he was trying to say with his story, so I shouldn't be touching any nerves (but, if I am, then I apologize and feel free to do what you must with this post). Keep in mind that you're going to have to answer different kinds of questions such as the DBQ's and use of rhetorical strategies on the test, but the basic concepts of how to write the essay effectively remain the same.\n\nSo, if you want something that is much more specific than the typical generic \"Write an outline\" and \"Use three examples\" stuff you get from Princeton Review, and a really good example of an essay that displays what my little strategies explain, read on. If you think this'll be a bunch of bull coming from the head of a 17-year-old, you can stop right now.\n\nBefore I start, I would like to take note that if you guys want to know where to find a bunch of examples of 8-essays, look here. It shows all the free-response questions from both the main tests and the form B tests from 2007-2003 (10 AP english exams worth of Free-Response questions, in other words). Each question has a sample essay (click the links saying \"sample responses Q1, Q2,\" etc.)  from people who took the exam, and below the essays (at the very bottom of all the sample response pages), are the scores and explanations for those scores.\n\nEach of 30 essays should have an example of an essay receiving an 8/9 and one receiving a 6/9 (along with some lower scored ones, but I didn't pay attention to those) in the sample response section. Just read the 8 closely, make sure you understand what the person did well to get that 8, and read the 6 as well, if you want, and see what the difference was between the 6 essay and the 8 essay. Try to do write the same way the 8 essay does.\n\nIf you're in AP English Language and you've paid attention at all this year, you'll know that the importance of writing a good essay is answering the question with as much clarity, effectiveness, coherence, and sophistication of language as possible. That's a very broad statement. The first four things are what I think you can improve on right now both with this little guide and the examples from previous exams. Sophistication of writing is something that takes longer to develop. You can only get that from reading material more sophisticated than what you are capable of writing (which, for a high school student, shouldn't be hard to find), and then learning from that and trying to write with that extra pizzazz. It's a process of seeing and practicing that takes a while, much longer than the few hours spent cramming before an exam. Fortunately, the fact that you've made it anywhere in an AP English class and the fact that you care enough about your score to actually be studying and looking here for tips (not one of those kids who doesn't give a **** about the exam and is choosing to \"wing it\") should mean that you at least know how to write with enough sophistication to get an 8. According to the AP guys, the difference between an 8 and a 9 can be the sophistication of language use, though. My English teacher didn't put much stock into sophistication of language during my AP English course, and I can't say that I built much of it either because I wasn't very good with the reading. In fact, the strengths of my writing style are, in my opinion, based a bit more on trying to put a bit of emotion into my writing, and trying to evoke a bit of inspiration at times through my words, even. Spending a lot of time on online forums can help even, if you pay attention to making what you write sound intelligent and conversational (borderline witty, I guess), and you pay attention to the other witty posters you find- noth the oneos who type olike thsi all the tim.\n\nThe clarity comes in making sure not to throw in anything that isn't intended to support the point you're trying to make. Each sentence should be written with the specific paragraph it is in in mind. If you can look back at your essay, and every single sentence is essential to the purpose of its specific paragraph, you're golden. Then, there's effectiveness. Effectiveness starts with a very clear and specific thesis (not much is possible without one, because it'll be too hard to support a vague thesis). You need to support your points well, both in what things you choose to support them with and how well you explain those things. On the level of individual paragraphs, that means choosing examples that support the main point of that idea best (after all, the only way you can prove something to your reader is by choosing facts that clearly agree with what you're trying to say) and making sure that you EXPLAIN how that evidence supports each paragraph's topic sentence (similar to how the effectiveness of the paper as a whole starts with a good thesis, effectiveness of each paragraph starts with a good topic sentence). On the level of the whole, effectiveness is how well you chose the points you used in each paragraph to support, and how effective those paragraphs were in explaining those points. To sum this up, effectiveness is about how well you use facts/quotes/specific references/whatever your specific examples may be to support your assertions (notice how I don't say \"opinion\" here\n\n(New Paragraph if anyone's eyes are hurting)Development comes through how well your essay is logically organized. Your intro pararaph should start from making a very broad statement of the topic at hand, and then gradually grow more specific until you hit your thesis statement. It's like a funnel (lame metaphor my school uses to describe a good intro). In the body, you need to make sure that you logically order everything as best you can- the specific examples in the paragraphs and the order of the paragraphs. This is tricky to describe, because you can take different approaches, but the most basic one is to simply go from the least significant paragraph to the most significant one last in the body. The same goes for the individual examples in the paragraph, the basic approach is to go from least significant to most significant. There are different ways to do organize your essay, obviously. The AP Scorers apparently like a bit of creativity in how you doing things, but you have to be very careful. The idea is that after you write the introduction (which, by the way, I think you should always use the funnel approach for, I never experiment with that.... general>>>specific can do no wrong), the body should always be building off itself. As you progress through each paragraph, you'll know that you're organizing it correctly if each example builds off the one preceding it (I'm not talking about topic and concluding sentences here, because those always go in the same place) and each body paragraph should build off the one preceding it somehow. As for the concluding paragraph, it should be an upside down funnel, unlike the regular funnel in the intro paragraph. It starts with the restatement of the thesis (more on the importance of that later), and grows more and more general, finalizing it with a statement about the general situation. The concluding paragraph should be a bit more specific than the intro, because it is written after you have made a conclusion, unlike the intro paragraph which is holding back, simple leading into the discussion without telling too much.\n\nNow comes the most important thing (in my opinion), coherence. Coherence is all about how well you can tie in the support to reach conclusions. The coherence of your paper is only as good as it's concluding statements and concluding paragraph, and it is centered on your restatement of your thesis. On the level of individual paragraphs, your paragraph is coherent if you can find a way to take all the evidence to reach a concluding statement that ties it all in together. I tend to not find topic sentences as important as concluding sentences. In fact, I try just as hard not to say too MUCH in the topic sentences as I do to say enough. Say enough to lead the reader into the point of the paragraph, but leave enough to keep them reading so you can ultimately write a satisfying concluding statement. The problem with putting too much in the topic sentence is that the concluding sentence won't have as much effect if it is a mere restatement. You need to create a pattern with your examples, and the concluding sentence should restate the topic sentence and add the pattern to it to form the complete idea of the paragraph. It can be hard to explain, but you'll know that you've concluded the paragraph well if it is a real \"Aha!\" moment. Your reader has to look at it and that statement should really hit them, making them think \"So THAT is what all this build-up with his examples meant!\" If a reader were to skim over your paper and only look at one sentence in each paragraph, the concluding sentence is the one you want them to look at. The coherence is how well every example fits that pattern leading to the conclusion. The restatement of the thesis at the beginning of the concluding paragraph is, in my opinion, the most important \"Aha!\" moment in the entire essay. It takes the bigger pattern formed by the ideas in your body paragraphs and ties them together with the one restatement of the thesis. That restatement should take the thesis and add the pattern formed by your body paragraphs to it to form the ultimate idea of the whole essay. It is the one sentence you've been waiting to say all along, and if your paper is truly coherent, everything should lead into the pattern represented by that one sentence.\n\n\n\nRead through it once to see what the topic is, I don't want to spend any more time describing it. Now, I'm going to describe the strengths and a couple weaknesses of my paper paragraph by paragraph. Remember, this paper got a 96 from my English teacher, and that was by the standards a proof-read out-of-class essay. Obviously, I won't be able to write this quality in the limited testing time period, but it's pretty much what I strive for if I want to get a 9 on my essays.\n\nIn my intro paragraph, I told the reader exactly what to expect. My paper was based on citing a source that opposed my opinion as my first example in each body paragraph, and then using examples to bring it down, so I did something similar in my intro paragraph. I chose very effective quotes- one perfectly summarized the opinion of the opposers I was refuting, the other perfectly summarized the point I was going to make. I then gave a thesis statement saying exactly what to expect in the coming paragraphs (Now that I think of it, the thesis statement/topic sentences can be considered the \"what\" of the whole essay/individual paragraphs, while the thesis restatement/concluding statements can be thought of as the \"what\" with the \"how\" included). I also succeeded with the development of that first paragraph. It started at the very general, simply stating the book being discussed and giving the eency bit of background on it that I would focus on throughout the story. I then got more specific, introducing the idea of the issue at hand. Then... more specific, I used a quote to introduce the side that I would be refuting. I got even more specific, introducing with another quote the side that I would be taking. I then stated which side I agreed with, and finished off the intro with its most specific statement, the thesis.\n\nI'm not going to go into too much depth with my body paragraphs. My first two topic sentences weren't very good, and the third was just decent. The first two simply merely set the scene and nothing else, and only the very first sentence of the paper should be that general. For example, a better topic sentence for my first paragraph would've been \"The whole novel up until a point when Huck finds himself amongst a bloody feud between between two families, the Shepherdsons and the Grangerfords, is merely set up.\" That sets the reader up for the point I'm going to make, that this point in the story is where the book begins.\n\nRemember how I said you can be creative with the development of your evidence? I did that here. Instead of merely just using examples from the book all supporting my point, my first example in each paragraph was a quote from Smiley's article. Each quote showed her making some kind of assertion about how some specific in the book ruined it, and then I built my entire paragraph around that quote. I agreed with each of Smiley's quotes in saying that the story did in fact do the things she said it did, but I disagreed with each one saying that those things that Twain did actually helped the story send the message it was trying to send. I argued that she was missing the message, illustrating it with each quote, and the rest of my body paragraphs built beautifully off of that as I used examples confirming what Smiley said was happening, but I then did a complete 180 on each one, using the examples to support my point of view, not hers. I used examples that illustrated everything exactly the way I wanted to, and I was able to explain their significance very well, which led to much effectiveness. The development was very good as each example in the paragraph built off the last one and built around each quote by smiley. The paragraphs also built off of each other. The first body paragraph established the presence of Southern Satire in the book. Because of that being established, I could talk in the second paragraph about how the main characters were satirized, as well, which brought me closer to my point. The final body paragraph built off the fact that the main characters were susceptible to the traits being satirized, and then showed how the development of one of those main characters was complete ruined as a result of a steroetypically southern mindset- thus completing the satire and finally developing the point at the end of that paragraph.\n\nNow... coherence. I thought that my paper was very coherent in the sense that all of the examples in the paragraph were focused on their paragraph's main points, and the conclusions reached in the main paragraphs all mixed perfectly to form the conclusion.\n\nAs for clarity. Well, I don't have much to say about that. My paper was pretty clear, I didn't really waste much time anywhere. I stayed very true-to-the-point, for the most part. I thought that the fact that all of my conclusions to body paragraphs and the restatement of the thesis were two sentences was a tiny problem, while I could've been more direct with just one for each.\n\nSo, there you go. Whatever authority I may have, I'm using it to say that this quality of my paper would be good to strive for. With all the extra time I had to spend on it and how carefully I was able to work on it, it was definitely a 5. My English definitely thought so, and he is no joke. Obviously, it's a bit different when you've got to write something in 40-55 minutes, but the basic rules are the same: Clarity, Development, Effectiveness, and Coherence. Clarity is how well you stick to the topic without wasting words or deviating, development is how well you organize the evidence for your ideas, effectiveness is how strong your ideas are and how strong your evidence supports those ideas, and coherence is how well all your evidence and ideas can be tied together to reach the ultimate answer you are trying to convey. Sophisticated language is the X-factor here. I can't help you guys much with it.

Summer Registration begins with check-in at Illini Union (west side of the building), which officially starts at 8:30am.  My advice is to get there at 8 as they're setting up, because you need to run across the street to the bookstore to obtain your I-card (have your UIN number ready), and set up a TCF checking account, if you so desire.  TCF bank is partnering with the university to set up student checking and/or savings accounts (P.S. Don't blindly opt-in to their overdraft protection scheme, where they'll pay regardless of the funds in your account, and charge you a $35 fee each time they do this...\"gee, thanks?\").  TCF has ATMs all over campus, so it's convenient, but it's not your only option.\n\nAfter obtaining your ID (along with 350 of your new friends if you're not early), you run back to Illini Union, listen to a U of I general talk, then split up into your respective college groups in different buildings on campus, led there by a current student.  Engineering's talk (by the \"206 Deans\" administrative assistant (read gatekeeper) was in Altgeld Hall (500 feet away), and your \"guest(s)/(parent(s) are still with you at this point.  This is where you get the college-specific talk.  After that, the parents head back to Illini Union for more information about the upcoming fall semester, housing, financial aid, billing etc, while the students head over (not sure where here, because I wasn't there) for an evaluation of both the \"homework\" that you've printed out, as well as the results of the proficiency tests you've taken.  You should print out the results that are available after you complete each exam.  Chemistry is the exception here, but if you've taken the tests enough in advance, they'll have a copy of the results too.  What exactly \"in advance\" means is up for interpretation, but I've heard anywhere from a few days to two weeks.  I'd go with two weeks, or your registration experience will not be a quick, or pleasent one.  If you haven't done the homework, or taken the required placement tests, you'll have to take them before your advising session.\n\nYour advising session is where you and your advisor look over your known and expected AP scores, your placement test results, ACT English Subscore etc, to determine what general requirements courses, and degree-specific courses you anticipate (AP results won't be out until mid to late July) you'll get credit for.  They need this information to create a list of classes, and a schedule for you to take to a computer, where you'll log in and register for classes under guidence from some helpful current students and/or knowledgeable college staff.  You'll need your Enterprise ID and password for this.  Please note that a registration hold was on your ID and was only removed after you passed the above evaluation of your homework and test results.  It is once again placed on your account at midnight of your summer registration date, and will not be removed for you to change your schedule (due to AP results, or for whatever reason) until the first day of classes.\n\nThis is why I strongly advise you to determine what requirements you'll likely have credit for prior to attending summer registration.  Then, using the requirements for the degree you are taking create a tentative schedule of your own.  The course listings are online for the Fall 2010 semester.  Read them carefully for prerequisites, corequisites, class and college restrictions, and either using an online tool, like Scheedule (Scheedule - A Better Way To Schedule), or your own homemade weekly grid place these classes into your weekly schedule.  Doing this will familiarize you with exactly what you'll be doing during summer registration, and allow you to communicate and understand your advising session much more clearly.\n\nOne other thing.  Many of the general requirement classes are clumped in the \"South Quad\" area of campus.  You'll need more than 10 minutes to get to them from the engineering quad, so have a campus map with you when you're creating that tentative schedule of yours.\n\nFinally, your schedule should reflect courses that actually fulfill requirements of your degree.  Otherwise, that cool wine-tasting social science course is an expensive way to pass your time in college.\n\nBack to the day's schedule.  Your homework/placement test evaluation occurs before lunch, which is back in Illini Union.  You'll hook up with your parents at this point again, where you can let them know when your advising appointment is to occur.  Advising starts in the early afternoon.  That, and the actual act of registering will take at least 2 hours, if you're prepared...much longer, if you're not.  Information tables are set up from various departments on campus to answer questions, and housing and campus tours are available in the afternoon too.\n\nThat's the day in a nutshell.  Good luck everyone.

However, nearly all of them look only at one facet of the overlying problem, which is somewhat short-sighted. While they are part of the bigger picture, we need to view the issue in its entirety before we choose to take a plan of action. In this way, we can develop a holistic approach to dealing with the problem. However, the complexity of the issue should not be understated, as it is an unintended by-product of a number of social and economic issues, many of which are unrelated and will have to be dealt with separately. So here goes.\n\nFirst, let\u2019s look at the social and demographic side of things. Over the last few decades (truthfully the last century), the population has been growing at an exponential rate. Since 1970, this has resulted in a population boom in which the number of people in the US has more than doubled. For the better part of three decades, business was able to keep up (with some relatively minor economic hiccups). Jobs were being created at a fast enough pace, and the economy was generally healthy. Even into the new millennium America was experiencing one of its most prosperous periods in history (albeit false growth dependent in part on synthetic CDOs, effectively the splitting and resale of subprime securities (rated AAA), and the housing bubble).  But I digress. As the population soared, so did technological advancement, and the information age was being born. People were exchanging information and ideas at a rate like never before, and all seemed well in paradise. One of these ideas was that people who held degrees were earning more. Salary figure reports demonstrated that college graduates could earn upwards of one million dollars MORE in a lifetime than their counterparts without degrees. And so the mad rush for education began.\n\nIt has also been a broad, general consensus that knowledge is a right. I am one of the proponents for this school of thought. If an individual so chooses to be educated, they should be free to pursue that education. This thought, combined with the societal push towards college education, resulted in a huge surge in the number of colleges across the nation to accommodate the influx of students. Traditionally, colleges existed to educate students, not to place them in jobs. However, with salary reports, the perception shifted, and people pursued degrees specifically to attain higher paying jobs. There are a couple notes of interest on this point:\n\n1)\tInflation in tuition \u2013 As tuition prices increased (because of budget cuts on the federal and state levels), there was more pressure to attain higher paying jobs. Additionally, many state-sponsored scholarship programs bottomed out, leaving students to cover the higher costs. This resulted in a significant increase in the actual cost of attaining higher education.\n\n2)\tFlooding of the job market \u2013 As more people attained degrees, obviously there was far more competition for jobs requiring degrees. As a result, many people have / are starting to go back to school to pursue advanced degrees, in order to distinguish themselves over the competition. I have seen the effect of this myself. Entry level job postings often require a bachelors degree, with a master\u2019s STRONGLY PREFERRED. This is the common language. (I have also seen cases where they state outright that they will only accept people with a master\u2019s.) A friend of mine was beat out for a job as a lab technician (entry level \u2013 not particularly technical work) by a guy with a Master\u2019s degree in Materials Engineering. On another note, this perpetuates the problem listed above. Grad school isn\u2019t cheap. This simply increases the actual cost of attaining a job requiring a degree. (So at what point is it no longer economical to pursue a degree? Eventually there\u2019s a point where the opportunity cost of pursuing a 5-6+year degree, combined with lower starting pay, no longer justify it as a viable option). It should also be addressed that when the economy buckled in 2008, many people lost their jobs. This flooded the job market with experienced employees, making it harder still for recent graduates.\n\nAlright, now let\u2019s shift focus to the business and financial side of things. (Keep in mind I am not trying to step on anyone\u2019s toes.) The point of primary importance here is that the court has ruled in a couple of cases that corporations are obligated, above all else (and this includes the well-being of the community as a whole), to serve the interests of its shareholders (see (1) Dodge v. Ford and (2) eBay v. Newmark). While there is a fair amount of debate as to the validity of this idea, it still has precedent in court and is enforceable by law. If a company chooses to be philanthropic, shareholders can contest that it did not represent their interest. As a result, companies are required to seek ways to maximize profits and minimize expenditures. (This is also, perhaps, a fundamental goal of free-market capitalism. It\u2019s based on competition and maximizing profits. Nobody\u2019s fault, and quite simply, it is human nature to want more\u2026.not always, but mass psychology and consumerism suggests this is the case for the majority). Since corporations are large companies, they provide substantial job markets for graduates. Therefore, this corporate responsibility carries huge implications for its employees, explained below.\n\nI have heard MANY members of older generations state, on multiple occasions no less, that you simply need the degree to make yourself marketable, because it simply demonstrates your ability and willingness to learn (I seriously get sick of hearing this, especially now that I  have a degree). This may have been the case in the past, but many companies no longer accept it as their responsibility to train individuals for the job. They want employees who can start on day one at maximum productivity. However, universities were never intended to provide \u201con-the-job\u201d training. This creates a huge disconnect, where graduates cannot meet the \u201centry-level\u201d requirements posed by companies. So how does this relate to corporate profits? Well, a new hire is often a fairly significant investment on the part of the company. They often contribute in a limited capacity for a given amount of time (this will vary obviously). With the advancement of technological software applications in nearly every field, entry level jobs are often dependent on an individual\u2019s aptitude with a given technology. They are, more often than not, expected to be able to crunch numbers, organize data, model designs, etc. (Simply put, know how to use certain software). Basically, this is now a major portion of the \u201cbusy-work,\u201d the entry-level grunt work. In order to reduce operating costs, many companies are choosing to outsource. They can \u201cbuy\u201d workers from other countries to complete these tasks at pennies on the dollar compared to their American counterparts. While this may seem attractive for short-term profit, they may not have considered the effects. In this situation, neither the outsourced employee, nor the American reject, is exposed to the workings of the business. They do not gain experience in more advanced job responsibilities that come over time in a workplace. Thus, fewer employees are being developed for management or more skilled positions later. Therefore, we are facing an enormous shortage in skilled workers in a number of fields. (Here, I am speaking from an engineering prospective, as my degree is in civil engineering). Another point of interest is that multinational corporations (again, often the biggest companies with the most jobs to offer) are subject to double taxing in the United States. First, America has the highest corporate tax rate in the world. Then, when profits are distributed to shareholders at year end, they are subject to taxation a second time. It seems to me that this would encourage activity outside of the United States. (I welcome informed debate on this one as, admittedly, my knowledge base is somewhat lacking).\n\nThere is also a darker side to the story. It should be recognized that as companies have reduced labor costs to achieve profitability, some employees have been placing pressure on HR and management to hire in order to mitigate the increased workload. Employers then post jobs that have no intention of being filled. This inflates the number of jobs that are \u201cavailable.\u201d When asked why they hadn\u2019t filled these positions, the common answer is that there were no qualified candidates. Not true.\n\n**** ASIDE \u2013 I still encourage you to read it, but not necessary. ****\nI want to make a quick side note here. Companies often have unrealistic expectations of interns as well. In two separate cases, I was expected to learn a computer program from scratch and contribute to a project. After my freshman year, I secured an internship in robotic systems development. This was my last choice out of all available departments, but they placed me there anyway. I was expected to know or learn C++ in order to look through some of the compiled programs. As someone with no experience in programming, this was hilariously futile, and I spent my days frustrated, pouring over C++ manuals going nowhere. I also didn\u2019t receive any one-on-one instruction. During my second internship, I was expected to learn 3DS Max and help with some modeling and animation work. Again, I was given no instruction, and it was left to the other interns who had spent their last four summers self-teaching themselves the program to provide me with the background I needed. Maybe some of you have had better experiences with internships, but I am sure there are also some that can identify with what I\u2019m saying. The result? Well, companies often look to internship experience to see if you developed the skills to meet entry-level requirements. So, everyone wants you to already know software applications, but training for some of these programs (usually hosted by the company that writes the software) can reach into the thousands of dollars. It would take very enterprising, dedicated individuals a lot of time to teach themselves.\n**** END ASIDE ****\n\nAnd this brings up another point. Companies desire to increase productivity by implementing state-of-the-art technologies that have been engineered in the last couple decades. However, training is lacking and a lot of the time, management has little appreciation for the intricacies of such software because they never used it. If they have, training courses were often paid for by the company they worked for. Talk about a disconnect! We are now seeing some universities implementing courses that tackle the software applications, but often the course material is not advanced enough to even come close to mimicking job requirements.\n\nBut the impact of technological advancement does not stop here. (Mind you this is not an anti-technology rant. When implemented correctly, and when employees have the proper training, it could greatly bolster productivity). As technologies are developed to address specific challenges, jobs become increasingly specialized (e.g. - how many different types of computer programming languages are there to complete different tasks?). \u201cBut wait!\u201d you say. \u201cThis should create more jobs!\u201d Possibly, but specialization requires young people to make decisions early, and without change of heart at any point in their college career, to have the time to fully develop the skills necessary for an entry level position. This is just simply not a realistic expectation. As a first-hand example, there are many divisions of civil engineering (structural, water resources, transportation, land development, geotechnical, etc.). Each division has its own set of design challenges, and as a result, different software apps have been developed that aid an engineer within each division. And if you think this is limited to engineers or software developers, think again. I have spoken to finance, mathematics, economy majors who wish they had training in database and other software (obviously aside from Microsoft Excel, which is pretty standard). And this is still not the full scope.  Most of the time, as stated, training is limited both within the school curriculum (but then again, the school\u2019s job is to provide the knowledge base, not the job skills), and on the job. Students are therefore left with the responsibility of learning the software on their own. Since software licenses are often of substantial cost, students can typically only use them while they are on the school\u2019s academic license. But if a student has to work while going to school, in order to help cover increased education cost (or living expenses), good luck finding the time. And forget about a social life, unless you don\u2019t mind sacrificing grades a bit. And we wonder why depression is on the rise amongst college students.\n\nSo what can you do to safeguard yourself against all this? Damn good question. Primarily, make sure you know what you want to do early in life, and pursue the hell out of it. Research entry level job requirements and start familiarizing yourself with what you need to know. And stay current. Software is constantly evolving. I think this is your best bet. Keep in mind, however, that some factors are simply out of your control, and don\u2019t get discouraged. The importance of networking should also not be understated. My one regret is that I didn\u2019t network as well as I should have. I\u2019m not a particularly social person, and it\u2019s always been the hardest part of the whole professional development scheme for me. But it is important all the same. And networking isn\u2019t just a psychological thing. Of course you want to make yourself likeable and find someone in a company to vouch for you, but it\u2019s more than that. It\u2019s essentially a pre-screening that carries important productivity implications as well. The happier people are in the workplace, the more productive they will be. A lot of this happiness comes from good relationships with co-workers. If the company thinks you will be liked, and you have the recommendation of a current employee, they will be more likely to hire you on the grounds that you will get along with other employees. Overall, this would contribute to a better workplace environment, so stay positive and meet people in your field!\n\nOut of humor, I thought I\u2019d include some of the worst advice I\u2019ve seen with regards to weathering the job market and staying ahead of outsourcing:\n\n1)\tDevelop invaluable skills, such as software skills (refer to my previous arguments), bilingualism (This is simply not practical. It takes a huge amount of time.), or ability with rare equipment (if it\u2019s rare, you probably don\u2019t have access to it, and it\u2019s probably not in high demand).\n2)\tMove quickly up the ladder. (First, this assumes that you have a job. Second, it offers no practical advice on how to do this. Third, your company better be opening higher level jobs for this to happen.)\n3)\tTry to get hired by smaller companies. (Honestly, this one is okay. But it\u2019s far more difficult to find small companies that will hire entry level, or that are even looking for new hires, because they simply don\u2019t have the budget. Especially in economic times when business is slow going.)\n\nAs far as what needs to be done, there are some policy changes that need to take place, clearly, but I have no idea what, and I\u2019m not sure many people do. We need to better clarify the role businesses and universities should take in professional development of employees. Universities have career resource centers as well, but with budget cuts, these are often the first departments to go, despite the dramatic increase in tuition (which more than doubled between my freshman and senior years). Additionally, I have heard and agree with the following argument: we need to reshape our perception of trade jobs. Generally, they don\u2019t get the same kind of respect that jobs requiring degrees do, but they play just as important roles in our society. And since nearly half of all college graduates are working jobs that don\u2019t require a degree now, wouldn\u2019t it be beneficial to encourage some of our students to simply pursue these kinds of jobs outright rather than pursue a four year degree and fall into debt first? At the same time however, a hurting economy limits the number of these jobs available as well. Not to mention technological advancements, specifically in the field of robotics, have done away with some of these jobs, as well as jobs in unskilled labor. I read an interesting article on the morality of technology (with respect to its reducing the number of available jobs), but alas I cannot find it now. I didn\u2019t agree with quite a bit of it, but the fact still remains that workers are being displaced by robots. Look at assembly lines, and developments in machining. Look at the DIY checkouts in your local stores, or increased use of robotics in processing plants. These are just a few examples. Ultimately, the degree of accuracy and efficiency that robots provide can override human intuition where it may not be necessary. Robotics will never displace humans entirely, but with increasingly advanced innovation, we are still seeing the effects. It takes far fewer people to troubleshoot the robots than to make up the man hours that these robots work. Maybe the growth we experienced is simply unsustainable. I don\u2019t really know, but something needs to be done. We have a lot of hard questions that need to be answered, and it\u2019s time we find those answers.

The professor's teaching style can be equally important as the subject matter, and it is definitely worth your time to sit in on as many courses as you can to weed out the best.  Ratemyprofessor only gets you so far...\n\nStudying: Buy noise cancellation headphones.  Best investment I have ever made- I could study in the middle of my loud dorm and feel like I was on a deserted island with those things.  They also happen to be very handy on airplanes when you are sitting next to a \"Talker\" (\"Not meaning to be rude, but if I don't respond it's because I actually cannot hear you.\")  Does wonders.\n\nClass Attendance:  Go to class.  Seriously, don't be dumb...if you calculate tuition and look at the amount you are paying for each class, odds are that sleeping through calculus will cost you at least 50-100 dollars...that's enough money to buy 5 times as many \"beverages\" as you consumed the night before that resulted in your missing class in the first place...so save the money for the weekends and work hard before you play hard.\n\nLearning Style:  Everyone learns differently, but one strategy that really helped me ascertain information was to think of visual scenarios or acronyms for study material.  Here is an example:\n\nNight before a psych exam, I need to know the various parts/functions of the brain.  One area is the hippocampus, which controls long term memory and spatial navigation.  Now, think about a visual that is wacky and memorable....that's right, folks: A hippo jumping through your campus dorm window would be pretty memorable (and result from poor navigation on the hippo's part).  Honestly, it may seem surprising but often times the weirder the scenario, the better you will remember it.  I was so excited about this window-destroying hippo that I anticipated that part of the exam and I nailed it.\n\nTest Prep:  Schedule a study group two nights before an exam, and invite your class crush.  This is beneficial for two reasons: 1.  It will motivate you to know the material so you do not come across as a complete idiot in front of the cute girl/guy you invited to the study group.  2.   It will give you enough time to identify the information you are not as familiar with, and give you the peace of mind to have that extra day to take it all in (rather than pulling an all nighter when the group ends at 3am and you realize you are screwed).\n\nStaying Focused:  For me, the solution was quite simple.  I didn't need any sort of caffeine or other pills...I was able to simply stay focused out of necessity.  If you can handle the pressure and put in the time to plan out an essay (i.e. get your sources, a solid outline)...last minute can do wonders.  If it weren't for the last minute, after all, nothing would get done.\n\nIf you are reading this and cringing because that is not your style at all, my recommendation would be similar to the study group suggestion: do work with your crush.  You will want to impress away by showcasing your conscientious work ethic.\n\n\nOrganization\n\nTime Management: It's OK to take breaks.  In fact, breaks are a must!  Study for an hour or two (whatever your limit may be), and take a well-earned break to decompress before hitting the books again.  It's also helpful to spread out work around an existing schedule to break it up and make it more manageable.\n\nRe: facebook.  Don't do it.  If you are studying, I don't care if you \"just have to go on really quick to get someone's phone number.\"  We all know that after 10 seconds you will be directed to some psuedo-stranger's photos from their recent trip to Vegas and an hour later you will logout, feel guilty, and immediately realize that you didn't even remember to get the information you initially needed.\n\nCalendar:  I feel blessed to have attended college before blackberry's made it big.  That is to say, I actually owned a physical calendar.  It worked well, given that there is never any potential for technical glitches when you write things down and have it in front of you.\n\nWith that said, for collaborative organizing, Google Calendar is so helpful to see other people's schedules and find times that work for everyone.  Do whatever you are most comfortable with.\n\nFinances/Budget:  Do you REALLY need that 7 dollar venti starbucks frappuccino?  I'm just saying...they add up pretty quickly...\n\nBudgeting is pretty simple:  Figure out your weekly or monthly allowance, and then record your habits for a week and realize how far off your total was from your projections.  Continue to play the \"I swear I will stick to my budget this time\" game for the remainder of college.\n\nSocial Life\n\nRoommate:  Communication communication communication.  That's all there is to it.  If you have something nice to say, say it.  If you have an issue, bring it up in a mature fashion (the whole \"let's be passive aggressive and roll our eyes at each other until the issue explodes\" approach is SO high school).  If he or she does not shower for 72+ hours, I'm pretty sure there is a law somewhere that you are allowed to request a new roomie...\n\nSocial/Academic Life Balance:  Merge the two whenever possible.  Figure out which of your friends are \"study-friendly\" (that is to say, you can actually get work done together without gchat messaging across the table from each other the entire time).  It's nice to have a support network, even if it means just having someone to vent to or high-five when you finish that endless Cognitive Psych. chapter.\n\nDecision Making/Peer Pressure: If you are surrounded by a group of people doing something, just do it.  You don't want to be the odd man out, because then you will have no friends.\n\nI am being sarcastic (mostly).  There will be certain people who are more judgmental than others when it comes to participation (or lack therof) in certain activities, but overall just do what feels right and try to think about waking up the next morning...would you sufficiently regret this decision?  If yes, then your decision should go from definitely to possibly.  College is all about testing the waters...and everyone's current is completely different.  Don't go from a stream to a waterfall without passing through the internal dam of your moral compass.\n\nNow that I have sufficiently exhausted every metaphor known to man, hopefully you get the idea.  Oh, and one more thing- if you ever don't feel like doing something or going to an event, just say that you are feeling nauseous.  No one wants to be around the sick kid, plus nausea is something that can pass and an excuse that will not result in awkwardness a couple of hours later if you bump into everyone at a party (\"My stomach feels so much better!\" is far more credible than \"Turns out I don't have an identical twin in town this weekend...or any weekend...).\n\nHealthy Lifestyle\n\nNutrition:  Moderation, people.  Diet is all about healthy variety.  If nothing else, I promise you that the following switch will improve your diet drastically: Instead of drinking copious amounts of soda and juice, replace them with water and milk and your bones and mind will thank you.  (Juice is OK every once in a while, but they are dangerously deceptive)\n\nSleep:  I would highly recommend getting some every once in a while.  7+ hours, if you can.  I got about 5 hours/night during the weekdays and I would crash for 12 hours during the weekends, and let me tell you there is nothing more sickening than hearing birds chirping as you are studying at 5am, or waking up on a Sunday afternoon finding it to be pitch black outside.  2 years later, my body is still recovering from my \"cool at the time, idiotic in retrospect\" sleep schedule.\n\nAlcohol:  Be very careful with mystery drinks/punches in a frat basement.  Also, keep in mind that alcohol doesn't really hit you until several minutes after consumption.  So, it's probably a smart idea to space it out and avoid taking several shots in a row.  Of tequila.  On your first night of college when first impressions are surprisingly lasting.\n\nStress-Reduction:  Naps were my savior.  Try to aim for 30-50 minutes, or else your nap can turn into a mini-sleep which can result in you waking up more exhausted and confused than when you laid down.  Also, it's important to put things in perspective.  Yes, you may have a huge orgo test in the morning, but there are people in third world countries without access to water and there are other college students (hopefully not your roomie) down the hall avoiding showers for days.  It's important to aim high, but recognize that people make mistakes.  Life continues even if you do not ace the exam.  Perhaps it will lead you to an exciting career surveying clients on whether they would prefer rectangular fried potatoes with their meal, but it continues nonetheless...(kidding! you'll be fine)\n\nExercise:  Join/create the intramural dodgeball team.  Great workout, great times.\n\nSupport:\n\nFriends:  College is a huge adjustment from high school, in that many of us will befriend people of all ages and not have the same consistency in our group of friends.  You ultimately have the make the decision of whether you value a more intimate group that you see often, or a more scattered group without the same sustainability.  Everyone has their own individual balance, and you will figure things out after a semester or two.\n\nParents:  Call them every once in a while, OK?  They are likely 10 times more anxious about your departure than you are, and a quick check-in on the way to class can go a long way.  Also, if you have a parents weekend that your rentals can attend, suggest a restaurant that they can take you and your friends (particularly your friends from far away whose parents could not make it).  A surrogate family is always appreciated, especially when it comes to good food.\n\nCounseling/Coaching:  Many campuses offer free counseling services.  Do not hesitate to take advantage of these resources!  Also, whether it is a friend, professor, or other member of your college community, I am sure you will come across several people who you can trust for support, or at least allow you to vent and point you in the right direction.  College is a blast, but it is also a time of personal growth and expansion of metaphoric bodies of water, so live it up but recognize that everyone is going through challenges, and you should never feel like you have to overlook any of your own.\n\nHope this was helpful, and I look forward to reading your comments!\n\nTime to get back to studying for my African Mammal Window Treatment exam...

The professor's teaching style can be equally important as the subject matter, and it is definitely worth your time to sit in on as many courses as you can to weed out the best. Ratemyprofessor only gets you so far...\n\nCourse Selection: Know the student handbook and course catalog like the back of your hand! Advisors at many schools are notoriously absent or ill-informed. This is especially true at large colleges. Know exactly which courses you need for your major, which courses fulfill elective requirements, and what is required of you every step of the way. If you know the rules that the college has put in writing, you can be your own advocate and ensure that you're never screwed by the beauracracy.\n\nStudying: Buy noise cancellation headphones. Best investment I have ever made- I could study in the middle of my loud dorm and feel like I was on a deserted island with those things. They also happen to be very handy on airplanes when you are sitting next to a \"Talker\" (\"Not meaning to be rude, but if I don't respond it's because I actually cannot hear you.\") Does wonders.\n\nClass Attendance: Go to class. Seriously, don't be dumb...if you calculate tuition and look at the amount you are paying for each class, odds are that sleeping through calculus will cost you at least 50-100 dollars...that's enough money to buy 10 times as many \"beverages\" as you consumed the night before that resulted in your missing class in the first place...so save the money for the weekends and work hard before you play hard.\n\nLearning Style: Everyone learns differently, but one strategy that really helped me ascertain information was to think of visual scenarios or acronyms for study material. Here is an example:\n\nNight before a psych exam, I need to know the various parts/functions of the brain. One area is the hippocampus, which controls long term memory and spatial navigation. Now, think about a visual that is wacky and memorable....that's right, folks: A hippo jumping through your campus dorm window would be pretty memorable (and result from poor navigation on the hippo's part). Honestly, it may seem surprising but often times the weirder the scenario, the better you will remember it. I was so excited about this window-destroying hippo that I looked forward to that part of the exam and I nailed it.\n\nTest Prep: Schedule a study group two nights before an exam, and invite your class crush. This is beneficial for two reasons: 1. It will motivate you to know the material so you do not come across as a complete idiot in front of the cute girl/guy you invited to the study group. 2. It will give you enough time to identify the information you are not as familiar with, and give you the peace of mind to have that extra day to take it all in (rather than pulling an all nighter when the group ends at 3am and you realize you are screwed).\n\nStaying Focused: For me, the solution was quite simple. I didn't need any sort of caffeine or other pills...I was able to simply stay focused out of necessity. If you can handle the pressure and put in the time to plan out an essay (i.e. get your sources, a solid outline)...last minute can do wonders. If it weren't for the last minute, after all, nothing would get done.\n\nIf you are reading this and cringing because that is not your style at all, my recommendation would be similar to the study group suggestion: do work with your crush. You will want to impress away by showcasing your conscientious work ethic.\n\nStaying Focused: Your GPA: It is the prime tool of \"ranking\" of how well you adapted to different challenges in college. Even thought you should try to get the highest grades throughout your college career, it is especially important in the first few semesters where a single grade can bring you up or down significantly. That said, if you go into your senior year with a 3.8 and end up with a B or even a C in a particularly challenging course your GPA will be practically unaffected, as opposed to getting a B or a C during your freshmen year where that could cause you to go down from a 3.8 to a 3.5 or bellow.\n\n\nOrganization\n\nTime Management: It's OK to take breaks. In fact, breaks are a must! Study for an hour or two (whatever your limit may be), and take a well-earned break to decompress before hitting the books again. It's also helpful to spread out work around an existing schedule to break it up and make it more manageable.\n\nRe: facebook. Don't do it. If you are studying, I don't care if you \"just have to go on really quick to get someone's phone number.\" We all know that after 10 seconds you will be directed to some psuedo-stranger's photos from their recent trip to Vegas and an hour later you will logout, feel guilty, and immediately realize that you didn't even remember to get the information you initially needed.\n\nCalendar: I feel blessed to have attended college before blackberry's made it big. That is to say, I actually owned a physical calendar. It worked well, given that there is never any potential for technical glitches when you write things down and have it in front of you.\n\nWith that said, for collaborative organizing, Google Calendar is so helpful to see other people's schedules and find times that work for everyone. Do whatever you are most comfortable with.\n\nFinances/Budget: Do you REALLY need that 7 dollar venti starbucks frappuccino? I'm just saying...they add up pretty quickly...\n\nBudgeting is pretty simple: Figure out your weekly or monthly allowance, and then record your habits for a week and realize how far off your total was from your projections. Continue to play the \"I swear I will stick to my budget this time\" game for the remainder of college.\n\nSocial Life\n\nRoommate: Communication communication communication. That's all there is to it. If you have something nice to say, say it. If you have an issue, bring it up in a mature fashion (the whole \"let's be passive aggressive and roll our eyes at each other until the issue explodes\" approach is SO high school). If he or she does not shower for 72+ hours, I'm pretty sure there is a law somewhere that you are allowed to request a new roomie...\n\nSocial/Academic Life Balance: Merge the two whenever possible. Figure out which of your friends are \"study-friendly\" (that is to say, you can actually get work done together without gchat messaging across the table from each other the entire time). It's nice to have a support network, even if it means just having someone to vent to or high-five when you finish that endless Cognitive Psych. chapter.\n\nSocial/Academic Life Balance: The only thing that popped into my head was \"priorities\", and how important it was to have them straight. This can stretch out to cover the \"I should study for this first because it will take the most time\" to \"I should really buy the solutions manual instead of the new Xbox game\". This also combines well with procrastination. What I mean is, although the party you plan on attending is of the \"utmost importance\" and your lowest test grade will be dropped anyway, go ahead and study for the test. I promise you, your life will not suffer if you miss that one night out, but a difference between an A and a B can greatly impact your grade in that class, which follows you for a really, really long time.\n\nDecision Making/Peer Pressure: If you are surrounded by a group of people doing something, just do it. You don't want to be the odd man out, because then you will have no friends.\n\nI am being sarcastic (mostly). There will be certain people who are more judgmental than others when it comes to participation (or lack therof) in certain activities, but overall just do what feels right and try to think about waking up the next morning...would you sufficiently regret this decision? If yes, then your decision should go from definitely to possibly. College is all about testing the waters...and everyone's current is completely different. Don't go from a stream to a waterfall without passing through the internal dam of your moral compass.\n\nNow that I have sufficiently exhausted every metaphor known to man, hopefully you get the idea. Oh, and one more thing- if you ever don't feel like doing something or going to an event, just say that you are feeling nauseous. No one wants to be around the sick kid, plus nausea is something that can pass and an excuse that will not result in awkwardness a couple of hours later if you bump into everyone at a party (\"My stomach feels so much better!\" is far more credible than \"Turns out I don't have an identical twin in town this weekend...or any weekend...).\n\nHealthy Lifestyle\n\nNutrition: Moderation, people. Diet is all about healthy variety. If nothing else, I promise you that the following switch will improve your diet drastically: Instead of drinking copious amounts of soda and juice, replace them with water and milk and your bones and mind will thank you. (Juice is OK every once in a while, but they are dangerously deceptive)\n\nSleep: I would highly recommend getting some every once in a while. 7+ hours, if you can. I got about 5 hours/night during the weekdays and I would crash for 12 hours during the weekends, and let me tell you there is nothing more sickening than hearing birds chirping as you are studying at 5am, or waking up on a Sunday afternoon finding it to be pitch black outside. 2 years later, my body is still recovering from my \"cool at the time, idiotic in retrospect\" sleep schedule.\n\nSleep: Wake up early! I'm an incoming freshman taking summer classes and I found that waking up at 6 am and going for a quick run jump starts the brain more than coffee ever could. Sometimes that means only getting a couple hours of sleep, but it's worth it because you can always take naps (not too long naps, however).\n\nAlcohol: Be very careful with mystery drinks/punches in a frat basement. Also, keep in mind that alcohol doesn't really hit you until several minutes after consumption. So, it's probably a smart idea to space it out and avoid taking several shots in a row. Of tequila. On your first night of college when first impressions are surprisingly lasting.\n\nStress-Reduction: Naps were my savior. Try to aim for 30-50 minutes, or else your nap can turn into a mini-sleep which can result in you waking up more exhausted and confused than when you laid down. Also, it's important to put things in perspective. Yes, you may have a huge orgo test in the morning, but there are people in third world countries without access to water and there are other college students (hopefully not your roomie) down the hall avoiding showers for days. It's important to aim high, but recognize that people make mistakes. Life continues even if you do not ace the exam. Perhaps it will lead you to an exciting career surveying clients on whether they would prefer rectangular fried potatoes with their meal, but it continues nonetheless...(kidding! you'll be fine)\n\nExercise: Join/create the intramural dodgeball team. Great workout, great times.\n\nSupport:\n\nFriends: College is a huge adjustment from high school, in that many of us will befriend people of all ages and not have the same consistency in our group of friends. You ultimately have the make the decision of whether you value a more intimate group that you see often, or a more scattered group without the same sustainability. Everyone has their own individual balance, and you will figure things out after a semester or two.\n\nParents: Call them every once in a while, OK? They are likely 10 times more anxious about your departure than you are, and a quick check-in on the way to class can go a long way. Also, if you have a parents weekend that your rentals can attend, suggest a restaurant that they can take you and your friends (particularly your friends from far away whose parents could not make it). A surrogate family is always appreciated, especially when it comes to good food.\n\nParents: On the subject of parents, I would say not only to call them once in a while, but find an excuse (even a lame one) to ask for their help or advice once a month. Which tie or skirt to wear to an event, how to approach a professor with a question, whether you should eat more salads...these are all good and harmless things you should ask your parents about, even if you don't really need their input.\n\nWhy bother?\n\nFirst, it makes them feel needed, which is good for your relationship with them, plus it allows them to feel that they've contributed in a way that matters to you, so that they are less likely to butt into the things you don't want them to meddle with. \"Johnny always asks when he needs our help, and since he's not asking for help with this, he must have it under control.\"\n\nSecond, it forces you to get comfortable asking for help and advice. The first ten times you ask them, it may just be your monthly made-up reason. The eleventh time, it may be something you genuinely can't handle on your own. Any hesitation to ask for the help you truly need should be gone by then.\n\nCounseling/Coaching: Many campuses offer free counseling services. Do not hesitate to take advantage of these resources! Also, whether it is a friend, professor, or other member of your college community, I am sure you will come across several people who you can trust for support, or at least allow you to vent and point you in the right direction. College is a blast, but it is also a time of personal growth and expansion of metaphoric bodies of water, so live it up but recognize that everyone is going through challenges, and you should never feel like you have to overlook any of your own.

This is my first post, and I suspect it to be a long one. It would be really helpful if you answer from of your own experience!\n\nSo, I am a student studying in Asia, doing my GCSEs. This is my first year of GCSE, so I still have over a year until my actual exams. After my GCSEs, I am planning to move to boarding schools (Phillips Andover, Phillips Exeter, Deerfield, etc.) as Grade 11.  Thus I am planning to spend my last 2 years of high school in a boarding school.\n\nEverything was going smooth until a few weeks ago, when I failed some tests/quiz for 2 subjects.  One is Design and Tech, and the other is a foreign language.  I got C and D respectively.  They were not coursework, so they are not going to affect my actual GCSE exams and results.  But since I have to apply before the actual exams, I am worried if the schools will look at those grades?  Or, since I have GCSE mocks before the end of this academic year, will they look at those instead?\n\nOur school doesn't have \"end-of-the-term grades\"/overall grades.  Instead, the teachers \"posts\" all our grades from all the quizzes, coursework, essays, tests etc. on this website.  This is what confuses me, because that way there will be so many different grades for each subjects by the time I send in my applications (for example, we already had 5 tests in Maths, so I have 5 different grades posted on that website).  I am hoping really hard that they will use my mock exam results instead, because at least I'll be able to improve that 2 subjects.\n\nAre those 2 horrible grades going to affect my chances to get in to those schools?\n\nExcept those 2 subjects, almost half my grades are As, other half A*s. Okay, I have 2 or 3 Bs.  Also for the foreign language, I got an A on my first term.  For DT, I got a B before.\n\nI think my ECs are quite good.\n- Tennis (7-8 years)\n- Violin (6-7 years, also on school orchestra)\n- MUN (joined this year, because it was only available starting this year)\n- I go to a local school every weekend to teach English to Primary kids\n- Sign language (done 1 month course of it during the summer, only available during summer holidays)\n- Art (I think I'm a good artist, I plan to send in my works when applying)\n\nI have pretty good relationships with my teachers.  Also, I'm attending Andover's Summer Program this summer, if that is going to increase my chance to get in to Andover.  If I have good essays and good SSAT results, will I still have a chance of me getting in to any of these schools?\n\nBut my main question is, are they going to use my GCSE mock exam results instead, and will those 2 grades affect my chances a lot?                "}, {"date": "2009-03-25T23:28:01+00:00", "url": "http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/stanford-university/676629-dont-make-the-same-mistake-i-did.html", "messages": "\n\n\n\nI went to Stanford as an Undergraduate in the late 1980's, majoring in one of the engineering departments...\n\nAnd it wasn't worth it. I view my diploma as a receipt, but nothing more. It's not as marketable as some propagandists would like you to believe. In fact, during this past summer's graduation ceremony, a number of students actually spelled out the word \"Unemployed!\" with pillows laid down on the football field, visible for all to see.\n\nLet me give you another example. For those of you who don't know, Donald Knuth is known in the academic community as the \"Father of Computer Science,\" and has been at Stanford since the late 1960's. He's well known for writing the \"Bible\" of computer science, \"The Art of Computer Programming\".\n\nYet even though I took over half-a-dozen core courses in Computer Science at Stanford, I never ONCE heard the name Donald Knuth, I never SAW the guy in person (or even in a photograph until I looked on his website many years after I graduated), and I have never read his books. \"The Art of Computer Programming\" books were never part of the curriculum.\n\nBut that's typical of Stanford: Pay a bunch of professors a lot of money to do very little teaching. In fact, professors generally have to teach only one-quarter (10 weeks total) of classes a year, and that's not even a full ten week period, because the lectures last all of 3 hours TOTAL in the week, and usually a couple of office hours placed at the most inconvenient times. This means that students are paying professors to devote 20% of a typical 40-hour work week to undergraduate matters, with the remaining 80% left to their own discretion. And for many professors, this schedule is in effect for only about 20% of the year (10 weeks out of 52 weeks in a year); the remaining 80% of the year is left to their discretion, such as doing research, consulting to other companies, doing lectures at other campuses, or running their own companies. (A rare handful of professors do teach for two quarters.) To add insult to injury, I had professors who skipped out on their office hours.\n\nA Stanford professor named Tom Campbell (Bachelors, Masters, and PhD degrees from the University of Chicago, PhD Harvard) actually served for five full terms in the House of Representatives of the United States Congress while simultaneously receiving his salary from Stanford. He spent so little time on the Stanford campus that some people started to get seriously upset. Critics charged that he was exploiting Stanford's flexibility, while advocates argued that he was increasing the visibility of Stanford and thus enhancing its reputation. After twenty years at Stanford, Campbell recently became the Dean of the Haas School of Business at UC Berkeley! Thanks Tom!\n\nMost professors don't grade papers, and leave it to the Teaching Assistants. This is like writing code without a computer in front of you, and never bothering to run the program on ANY computer. How do you know if your program works? How do the professors know if their teaching is any good? How many of Stanford's Nobel Prize winning faculty attended Stanford as an undergraduate? I don't think a single one.\n\nMost of the techie-Teaching Assistants didn't go to Stanford either. I had guys from Purdue, UCLA, Dartmouth, Amherst, U. of Maryland, U. of Texas, and of course, the ubiquitous University of California at Berkeley (UC Berkeley). Several profs got their undergrad degrees from Berkeley.\n\nThe professors always view themselves as RESEARCHERS first, and teachers a distant third or fourth -- if at all. If you look at the Stanford's \"Courses and Degrees\", which is a catalog that lists the courses being offered for a particular school year, you will see that many classes are taught by \"Staff\". No, \"Staff\" is not the name of a professor, but a euphemism for \"somebody who might be associated somehow to our department, such as a graduate student, and who may or may not have ever taught a class before, and who may or may not have any training in how to teach.\" Many of my classes were taught by Staff. I recently found out that the Staff instructor for an important core class, spanning two-quarters (20 weeks), had not even earned a Master's degree at the time he was teaching! He was a graduate student who only had a Bachelor's degree. He had practically zero teaching experience, and it showed. The poor quality of that class wasn't just my imagination, as that class has since been discontinued and is no longer offered, and that guy doesn't teach anymore anywhere in the world. But such vindication is small consolation. It was a waste of money and time that can never be recovered. Other core classes have even been taught by currently-matriculated UNDER-graduates. It amazes me that Stanford gets away with it, especially when most HIGH SCHOOLS require that their teachers have a master's degree and have passed state licensing exams.\n\nIn fact, some classes are so bad that Stanford undergraduates actually take courses at the nearby De Anza Community College and Foothill Community College. That's right: Community Colleges. Don't laugh -- if you read the book on the history of the Apple Macintosh, \"Insanely Great\", you'll find that the hardware engineer attended one of those community colleges (I don't remember which). And in my Freshman year, I knew a political science major who transferred from a California junior college into Stanford. As an out-of-stater, I was shocked, although I have learned that California's junior colleges have a higher standard than the rest of the nation. Nevertheless, it makes you wonder: Why am I paying so much money?\n\n\"Sophomore Slump\" occurs after the euphoria of Frosh year. You enter as a sophomore and realize \"the honeymoon is over\", i.e. that your professors aren't necessarily gifted in communicating their knowledge (one time literally a guy \"taught\" numerical analysis on computers by reading from a textbook!), and that the classes are bloated with too many students (I never had less than 50 in a class, so forget the 7:1 student teacher ratio published in US News and World Report's annual college survey).\n\nYears after I graduated, ex-president Gerhard Casper -- being a great guy who experienced similar problems during his undergraduate years in Germany -- tried to rectify the problem by creating Freshmen and Sophomore Seminars, to encourage faculty-student interaction and small class sizes. But the number of open slots for students is extremely limited, and most professors don't participate. Thus the vast majority of undergraduates miss out with one-on-one faculty contact, even though 100% of the student body pays the full $30,000/year tuition. And some of the seminars are of questionable quality. Nobel Prize winning physicist, Doug Osheroff (BS Caltech, PhD Cornell) taught a freshman seminar in...amateur photography. What a joke! Talk about taking advantage of the system.\n\nAnd don't get me started on the undergraduate \"advising system\", which is also a joke! Currently 78% of the faculty do NOT participate in advising undergrads. Many of the remaining advisers are upperclassmen trying to pad their resumes, or graduate students who are alumni of other universities and who are also trying to pad their resumes . You will not get good advice from these people, because they do not really have a track record to demonstrate the validity of their advice. It is the \"blind leading the blind.\" My own experience was a nightmare. Once I had declared my major, I chose a particular faculty member to be my adviser; he was the only guy in my field of interest. When I went to get my study list signed by him, he flatly refused, saying \"I don't advise undergraduates.\" I was furious, but what could I do? I ended up signing the remainder of my study lists on my own.\n\nHow do Stanford's engineering students fare when pitted against other students in competition? Not well. \"NATCAR\" is a contest for California electrical engineering students, in which radio controlled cars race around a track. Look at the results and search for the Stanford name: Race Results.\nAs you can see, Stanford placed 10th in 2001, but is otherwise a no-show. In at least one of the years, the Stanford team tried-- but failed -- to get a car running. It looks like they have now simply abandoned the idea of entering.\n\nStanford's marketing department has used deceptive tactics to imply that Stanford has produced successful people. Look beneath the superficialities, and you'll find that the overwhelming majority did not attend Stanford as an undergraduate, and sometimes, not even as a graduate student. All of the following people have been used in Stanford marketing literature and press releases:\n\n-Donald Knuth did not attend Stanford for his undergraduate degree; he went to Case Institute of Technology (Case Western Reserve). His PhD is from the California Institute of Technology (Caltech).\n\n-The founder of MIPS, John Hennessey, did not attend Stanford for his undergraduate degree. His alma mater is Villanova University. He got his graduate degrees at State University of New York, Stonybrook. Take a look at the Senior Management and the Board of Directors at MIPS (Home - MIPS Technologies -MIPS Everywhere - MIPS Technologies). Not a single one received a degree from the undergraduate school of engineering at Stanford, even though MIPS is only 15 minutes away from the Stanford campus! Yet Hennessey was a provost for the school of engineering and is currently the president of Stanford! Does he know something you don't?\n\n-The inventor of the mouse, Doug Engelbart, did not attend Stanford for his undergraduate degree. Engelbart picked up a degree in electrical engineering from Oregon State, and a Bachelor of Engineering and PhD from UC Berkeley.\n\n-The founders of Sun Microsystems did not attend Stanford for their undergraduate degrees. Vinod Khosla went to the Indian Institute of Technology and picked up his masters at Carnegie Mellon, Bill Joy went to U. of Michigan and picked up a Master's at UC Berkeley (in addition to inventing the sockets protocol for the Berkeley System Distribution of UNIX), Andy Bechtolsheim got his undergraduate training in Germany and got an MS from Carnegie-Mellon, and Scott McNealy went to Harvard.\n\n-The founders of Silicon Graphics did not attend Stanford for their undergraduate degree. Jim Clark attended a college in New Orleans, Louisiana, and picked up his PhD from the University of Utah. Marc Hannah went to U. of Illinois at Urbana Champaign. Charles Rhodes picked up his BS, MS, and PhD's from Purdue University. Kurt Akeley got his undergraduate degree from U. of Delaware.\n\n-The founders of Cisco System did not attend Stanford for their undergraduate degree. Len Bosack got his BSEE from U. of Pennsylvania. Sandra Lerner got her BA in Political Science from California State in Chico.\n\n-The founders of Google did not attend Stanford for their undergraduate degrees. Larry Page went to U. of Michigan. Sergey Brin's alma mater is U. of Maryland.\n\n-The founder of defunct VA-Linux and the fully functional Sourceforge did not attend Stanford for his undergraduate degree. Larry Augustin went to U. of Notre Dame.\n\n-The founders of Apple Computer did not attend Stanford for their undergraduate degrees. Steve Jobs attended (and dropped out of) Reed College. Steve Wozniak received his BSEE from UC Berkeley.\n\n-The co-inventor of the transistor, William Shockley, did not attend Stanford for his undergraduate degree. His alma mater is Caltech, and he got his PhD from MIT. But he grew up in Palo Alto, California (the town that surrounds Stanford University), and moved back to found one of the first transistor companies that would spawn off into the half-a-dozen companies that put the \"silicon\" in \"Silicon Valley\". (The founders of Intel didn't attend Stanford either.)\n\n-The founders of EBay did not attend Stanford for their undergraduate degrees. Pierre Omidyar went to Tufts and transferred to UC Berkeley. After founding EBay, he gave $10 million to Tufts. Jeff Skoll attended the University of Toronto.\n\n-The founders of Microsoft did not attend Stanford for their undergraduate degrees. Bill Gates dropped out of Harvard. Paul Allen graduated from the University of Washington in Seattle. The reason I bring this up is that the two nevertheless have their names on two buildings on the Stanford campus. The Gates Building houses the entire Computer Science Department. I wonder why Stanford needed to solicit their funds? Don't they have scores of successful alumni who could have donated the money? It's a rhetorical question, of course. Many of the buildings on campus were funded by non-alumni, including the massive Green Library and Green Earth Sciences building, Stern Hall, the Iris & B. Gerald Cantor Center for the Visual Arts (which was renamed from the Leland Stanford Jr. Memorial Art Museum), and others. Non alumnus and Silicon Graphics/Netscape founder Jim Clark recently caused a furor when he decided to stop funding the building of the Clark Biological Sciences building for Stanford's new department fusing biology and engineering. Explaining his decision in a published letter to the New York Times, Clark made it unequivocally clear that he gave the money for the building because he expected a return on his investment, and not out of love or loyalty to Stanford.\n\n-Finally, you've no doubt read in \"Burn Rate\" that Yahoo! was started by a couple of undergrads in their dorm room. Unfortunately, that's not true. The majority shareholder, David Filo, attended Tulane University as an undergraduate. He met up with another GRADUATE student Jerry Yang (who DID attend Stanford as an undergrad) at Stanford in Kyoto, Japan -- surprising to me, because I always thought the world wide Stanford centers were reserved for undergraduates.( But with over 900 electrical engineering GRADUATE students enrolled, versus maybe about 80 electrical engineering undergrads, it's clear that that the graduate students have the upper hand.)\n\nI could go on and on. Intel. National Semiconductor. Texas Instruments (which manufactures the chips for Sun.) None of these were founded by undergraduate alumni, and Stanford should not try to take credit and inflate its own resume based on the successes of non-alumni. How would you feel if (hypothetically speaking) an investigation revealed that your beloved local Krispy Kreme Doughnuts store was actually stealing the doughnuts from an obscure little local no-name bakery down the street, and repackaging and selling them to you at inflated prices? Wouldn't you want to switch to the bakery and save your money?\n\nAnybody who tells you otherwise is full of it. Especially US News and World Report. I realize that nobody can influence US News and World Report, so it's best to educate prospective college students with the facts. I've been there, and done that. Don't go to Stanford for your undergraduate degree, but DO go there for your graduate degree (although I think that Stanford now will take between 30% to 60% of the income of any invention or other intellectual property you create while working at their labs). And based on the biographies above, it's definitely OK to go to a state university. Some people feel a stigma otherwise.\n\nIf you don't believe any of this could happen, read the Boyer Commission's report at\n\nBoyer\n\nand \"Profscam\" by Charles Sykes, who ironically has a fellowship at the Hoover Institution, an independent think-tank nestled in the Hoover Tower on the Stanford campus.\n\nAlso, go to websites of various high tech companies, and look at the biographies of the executives. Find out the names of each executive's undergraduate alma mater. The results are often surprising, and will give you a clue about where you can get the best value for your money. In addition, take note of people who attended Stanford, and wisely figured out that they didn't need to continue paying Stanford for a lousy education:\n\n- Nobel prize winning author John Steinbeck.\n- Ted Danson, the actor who portrayed the bartender Sam Malone on the syndicated television series \"Cheers\". Danson transferred from Stanford to Carnegie-Mellon.\n- John McEnroe, Wimbledon tennis champion.\n- Reese Witherspoon, actress.\n- Tiger Woods, golfing prodigy and multi-gazillionaire.\n\nRemember, these folks DROPPED OUT of Stanford.\n\nYou may notice some reviews on this topic that claim that Stanford students are getting six figure salaries upon graduating. Caveat emptor -- that is all in the past, due to the hype of the Internet bubble, which has collapsed. As I pointed out, this year, graduating Stanford students had a tough time finding (and not finding) jobs. In these days of economic recession, incessant job layoffs, and uncertain times, you -- the potential college consumer -- owe it to yourself and your parents (or guardians) to get the best value for your money.\n\nFinally, let me say that writing this review is somewhat painful, because when I graduated from high school, ready to go to Stanford, my parents were proud, I felt like I had accomplished something, and the future looked great and rosy. When I got to Stanford and experienced it, it was not great, did not provide me with the fundamental and necessary training, and left me cynical and pessimistic about the underlying motivations of the faculty.\n\nDon't make the same mistake I did.\n\nGood luck in the future!\n\n(Feel free to send this info to any parent, high school counselor, or wide-eyed innocent high school student. When I was in high school, I didn't have the advantage of the Internet to research schools thoroughly. I wish I had had this information. )\n\n\nWhat do you guys think? Opinions? "}, {"date": "2011-08-17T15:37:27+00:00", "url": "http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/sat-preparation/1197047-please-grade-my-essay-thanks.html", "messages": "\n                    Topic: Does education, rather than improving us, actually constrain us at times?\n\n\"Education is one of the most important tools we have to be successful in a society where knowledge and intelligence give great advantage to those who possess them. This is why so many immigrants escaping from a foreign country want their US-born child to get an education;this is why so many less-than deserving people want their kids to go to college to avoid the children from following the parents' footsteps. Yet is there ever a time when education actually constrains us, confining ourselves from progress? Although the purpose, of education is not meant to constrain us, there are indeed periods throughout history when certain education were actually restraining younger generations from fully maturing into an individual who can be successful in society and advancing him or herself for the progress of society. People think that this type of immuring education only existed in the ancient days of the Dark Ages because now the modern society is just flourishing with advancement. Yet, as history tells us, this constraint not only existed during the Catholic Church's supremacy in the medieval ages, but also in the modern time as of the 21st Century.\n\nAlthough the US is the most powerful nation in the world, we are far behind in our education when we compare ourselves to other countries such as Finland and Korea. In fact, according to an international reoprt, the US ranked 26 out of the top 50 countries with the highest academic scores among hte younger generations. As a result of this discovery, along with many other reports verifying the lower standards of education in the US, President Bush enacted the No Child Left Behind Act to provide sufficient education to areas that were lacking in this necessary provision. To test and to enforce this act, however, the act requires that a school overall must pass a certain level of proficiency else the federal government would not give federal funding to that school. As a result, schools are now teaching students not to think individualy and creatively, but to pass a test. This issue has been censured by many people, especially teachers, because this standard did not teach students how to live successfully through creativity and idividual intelligence but rather through rote memorization, which they purport to be inadquately replacing the purpose of eduation. And as the reports show, this NCLB Act that the Bush Administration implemented proved to be disastrous for the US: scores were either the same or slowly decreasing, schools were being shut down for failing to pass the level of proficiency, teachers were desperately trying to cheat in order to meet the standard, and the education itself focused on rote memorization rather than tools to help kids succeed in the adult world. This act proved through its results that it actually constrained kids in their learning, confining them to only a small aspect of education that is entirely inadequate in teachings young kids life lessons not just in general terms but also in the realm of academics.\n\nMark Twain once said, \"History doesn't repeat itself. History rhymes.\" This quote provides an accurate description of the education taught both in the Middle Ages and in the modern society: both caused the younger generation to be impeded in their progress for society. However, just as the Catholic education ended for a new age of Renaissance and Enlightenment education, so can we change and reform the constraining education we have today for a new age of creativity and progress. But we must act now, or the young generations that are learning the education right now will be deprived from the necessary tools that could lead them to successful lives in the adult world.\"\n\n\nIt's a little longer than usual but that's because I typed this up instead of writing with a pen/pencil.

It may look \"suspicious\" if you have too many on your transcript.\nI would not re-take the classes over. I think that will make it look worse and bring more attention to the situation.\nDon't become too obsessed by feeling you have to stay in the 3.9 GPA range.\na couple of B+/A-'s won't keep you out of law school. Lots of kids get into top law schools with a 3.6 GPA.\nGood luck!!\n\nShould I graduate early? (courtesy bluedevilmike)\n\nIf anything, graduating early is frowned upon. Combining that factor with a lower GPA, I promise you law schools will look less favorably on a three-year candidate.\n\nShould I participate in 500 extra-curricular activities? (courtesy bluedevilmike)\n\nEC's are not completely trivial. But they're certainly not going to get you into a school where your LSAT is not remotely competitive.\n\n\nAim for the highest possible: GPA (4.0) and LSAT score (180) Keep in mind that the LSAT is normalized...\nFor the average score for accepted students at specific law schools, look in the helpful book U.S. News Ultimate Guide to Law Schools.\n\n\n\nBecause of the wide range of grading systems used by US colleges and universities, the LSDAS converts records into a standard format. Your LSDAS GPA may be different from your Cal GPA. For example, the LSDAS assigns an A+ a value of 4.3, while at Cal, an A+ is equivalent to 4.0. Since the LSDAS also takes into account all undergraduate coursework taken at other institutions, your LSDAS GPA will probably be different from your Cal GPA if you took classes at other colleges or universities. Detailed information about LSDAS GPA calculations can be found on the LSAC website.\n\nWhat is counted in the LSDAS GPA? (courtesy im_blue and tifania)\n\nOnly classes that were taken before you got your first bachelor's degree are counted in the LSDAS GPA, including those from high school, summer sessions, and study abroad. That's why it's useless to take additional classes after you graduate. Grad school grades are also not counted at all, although the fact that you have a graduate degree may be a small positive factor.\n\nAll grades and credits earned for a repeated course will be included in the GPA calculation if the course units and grades appear on the transcript. A line drawn through course information or a grade does not eliminate the course from GPA calculation if the course units appear on the transcript. and\nIf you do a dual degree program where you get a bachelor's and a master's degree at the same time, then those classes also count. All classes before you get your first bachelor's degree, simple as that.\n\nAll college grades regardless of when and where you took them (high school, study abroad, summers).\n\nWhat is the LSAT? (the following shamefully thieved from Wikipedia)\n\nThe LSAT is an examination administered by the Law School Admission Council (LSAC), intended to provide law schools in the United States and Canada with (to quote the LSAC) \"a standard measure of acquired reading and verbal reasoning skills that law schools can use as one of several factors in assessing applicants.\"\n\nIt has five 35 minute sections\n\nThe Sections\nReading Comprehension (RC)\nLogical Reasoning (x2) (LR)\nAnalytical Reasoning\nOne Unscored Section (no one knows which is the unscored section. If you count more than one RC or Analytical Reasoning section, one of those is the unscored section; likewise if you count three logical reasoning sections, one of them is the unscored section. No matter what, do your best on each section, even if one of them may be the experiemental/unscored section)\n\nAnd one 30 minute section\n\n\nThe writing sample is given in the form of a decision prompt, which provides the examinee with a problem and two criteria for making a decision. The examinee must then write an essay favoring one of two provided options over the other. The decision generally does not involve a controversial subject, but rather something mundane about which the examinee likely has no strong bias.\n\nThe writing sample is NOT SCORED! But is scanned and sent along with your score.\n\nThe writing sample is essentially an extemporaneous essay, hand-written in pencil at the conclusion of a four-hour examination. Between the quality of the handwriting and that of the digital image, some admissions officers regard the readability and usefulness of the writing sample as marginal. Additionally, schools require that applicants submit a \"personal statement\" of some kind. These factors sometimes result in admission boards ignoring the writing sample. However, only 6.8% of 157 schools surveyed by LSAC in 2006 indicated that they \"never\" use the writing sample when evaluating an application. In contrast, 9.9% of the schools reported that they \"always\" use the sample; 25.3% reported that they \"frequently\" use the sample; 32.7% responded \"occasionally\"; and 25.3% reported \"seldom\" using the sample.\n\n\nA few months before the exam seems to be the general consensus, keeping in mind that collegiate level analysis in humanities classes prepares one for the Reading Comprehension section, that the logic games for the LSAT must be studied prior to the exam, that out-of-school reading is necessary in order to quicken the rate at which one reads text during the exam, and that one must focus upon one's GPA in order to get into law school. However, some may study for a year prior to the LSAT. This is acceptable for students who wish to employ a less vigorous study for the LSAT. Keep in mind the QUALITY of your study is more important than the QUANTITY of studying you perform.\n\nRemember the following formula!\n\nGood GPA=learned materials/skills in college=learned skills and gained knowledge for the LSAT=Law School Admission!\n\nHow should I study for the LSAT?\n\nPreparing For the LSAT\n\nBooks to buy in order to study for the LSAT\n\nNOVA Master the LSAT (best!)\n10 Actual, Official LSAT Preptests by LSAC\nPowerscore LSAT Logic Games (or Logical Reasoning) Bible(s)\n\n\nWhen do I take the LSAT? (courtesy ariesathena)\n\nIt is offered four times per year: June, October, December, and February. June is given at 12:30, while the others are at 8:30 am. The test itself runs for 35 min per section, plus 30 min for the writing sample. Now, don't think of that as three hours - it's more like six. They check your ID at the door, fingerprint you, have very specific rituals for handing out and returning exams, all that - so it will take the better part of a day. Schedule accordingly (if you hate working past 5 pm, take a morning one - and non-morning people should take it in June).\n\nHow do I take the LSAT?\n\nP. Diddy's Notes\n\nRefer the the aforementioned study guides for more elaboration.\n\n\nThe lowest score is 120, while the highest score is 180. The higher the better!!! For average LSAT scores of accepted students at specific law schools, read U.S. News Ultimate Guide to Law School\n\nSee the LSAT Percentile Scale --> PowerScore | LSAT Help | LSAT Scoring Scale\n\nShould I take the LSAT more than once? (courtesy sallyawp)\n\nThe following information is derived from the following law schools' websites:\n\n1. Harvard Law School:\n\nQuote:\nShould I retake the LSAT? If you take the test more than once, all scores and their average will be reported and considered.\n\n2. Georgetown Law School:\n\nQuote:\nFor reporting purposes, Georgetown adheres to the ABA policy of reporting the higher LSAT score. For evaluation purposes, the Georgetown Admissions Committee typically averages LSAT scores. Georgetown may consider the higher LSAT score if you have only taken the LSAT twice. Please address any mitigating circumstances you feel the Admissions Committee should consider.\n\n3. Columbia Law School:\n\nQuote:\nEven though the ABA requires that we report the highest LSAT score, the Committee considers the entire LSAT testing history when evaluating applications for admission. Published statistics for this and prior years were based on average LSAT scores.\n\n4. NYU Law School:\n\nQuote:\nIf I take the LSAT more than once, does the Committee see the higher score?\nYes, but they evaluate based on the average score in most cases. The Committee may take special circumstances into account. If a candidate can point out specific reasons why the Committee should consider an LSAT score aberrant, they should detail those reasons in an addendum to the personal statement.\n\n5. Penn Law School:\n\nQuote:\nQ. If I take the LSAT more than once, does the Admissions Committee consider the average or the higher LSAT score?\nIf there are circumstances that you believe affected your performance on a prior test, we encourage you to provide an additional statement with your application explaining those circumstances. The Admissions Committee will consider such information and may, at its discretion, evaluate your application based on the higher or highest LSAT score.\n\n6. U of Chicago Law School:\n\nQuote:\nWhat if I took the LSAT more than once? We recognize that some students will take the LSAT more than once, perhaps because the first score was the product of unusual conditions or because it seemed low given earlier practice test scores. In keeping with recent changes in LSAC and ABA policies, we will focus on the higher of an applicant's two scores. LSAC data suggest that the first score is an excellent predictor of a second score; applicants are thus advised to re-take the test only if there is reason to expect significant improvement. We certainly do not wish to encourage expenditures on repeat test taking.\n\n7. U of Michigan Law School:\n\nQuote:\nHow does the University of Michigan Law School handle multiple LSAT scores?\nThe LSDAS report for an applicant who has sat for the LSAT more than once will show every score or cancellation, as well as the average score. The ABA requires law schools to report score information based on an admitted student's highest score, and therefore, that is the score to which we give the most weight. We do, however, consider the average score as well, because data provided by the Law School Admissions Council suggests that it has the greatest predictive utility. If you have a significant disparity between scores (six or more points), it would be very helpful to address any explanation for the difference in an optional essay or addendum.\n\n8. U of Virginia Law School:\n\nQuote:\nWhat is your policy on multiple LSAT scores?\nMultiple LSAT scores will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. We do not automatically use the average, the highest, or the most recent score, but will evaluate any information provided by the applicant that may be relevant to the interpretation of test results, such as illness, testing conditions, or other extenuating circumstances. The recent change to the ABA rule regarding multiple test scores affects only how we report the LSAT score of an applicant who took the LSAT more than once. The old rule required that law schools report the average of multiple scores; the revised rule now asks law schools to report the higher of multiple scores. The ABA rule does not now, nor did it ever, tell law schools to rely on one score over another in making admissions decisions, but rather encourages schools to look comprehensively at all information presented in an application for admission. That practice has not changed.\n\n9. Northwestern Law School:\n\nQuote:\nAll applicants are required to take the LSAT. The LSAT is administered in June, October, December, and February. Applicants may take the test more than once, but repetition is not advised unless some disruptive factor has interfered with performance during the first administration. If an applicant takes the LSAT more than once, the Admission Committee will consider all scores, the circumstances surrounding each test experience, and possible benefits resulting from prior exposure to the test. Test results are sent to the Law School by the Law School Admission Council. According to LSAC, scores are valid for five years after the test date.\n\n10. Cornell Law School:\n\nQuote:\nIf I take the LSAT more than once, will you take the highest score or the average of the scores?\nIn general, Cornell Law\u0092s policy is to take the higher score if it is at least 3 points higher than a prior score, but the Admissions Committee invites applicants to submit an addendum to their application explaining the different LSAT scores and why we should take the higher score.\n\n11. Duke Law School - no comment made on website\n\n12. Boalt - takes the highest (I'm sure someone can find the quote, if necessary)\n\n13. Yale - no comment made on website, school still states that they use a holistic approach to admissions\n\n14. Stanford - makes no comment on website\n\nMoreover, the takeaway seems to be that if you take the LSAT more than once, you had better have a good reason for doing so (102 degree fever, power outage at the testing location, death in the family, etc.) and you had better take some time to explain that reason in your application. Again, I emphasize that you should prepare for and go into the LSAT as if you are going to take the test once and only once. Having explanations for one thing or another on your application, instead of just having a strong application, diverts attention from your strengths and may lead to questions about your ability and/or your commitment.\n\nThe LSAC has repeatedly emphasized to law schools that your first LSAT is the test most likely to predict your success in law school, and I think that most of the top law schools are clearly keeping that advice in mind. You may take the LSAT more than once (in fact, up to three times in two years), but I believe that you do so to your detriment in admissions.\n\nWhich is the best law school? (shamefully stolen from Wikipedia)\n\nSchools that consistently rank in the top 14.\n\nThe \"Top Fourteen\" schools according to US News and World Report Rankings are (in alphabetical order):\n\n* Columbia Law School, Columbia University, in New York, NY.\n* Cornell Law School, Cornell University, in Ithaca, NY.\n* Duke University School of Law, Duke University, in Durham, NC.\n* Georgetown University Law Center, Georgetown University, in Washington, DC.\n* Harvard Law School, Harvard University, in Cambridge, MA.\n* New York University School of Law, New York University, in New York, NY.\n* Northwestern University School of Law, Northwestern University, in Chicago, IL.\n* Stanford Law School, Stanford University, in Stanford, CA.\n* University of California, Berkeley, School of Law, University of California, Berkeley, in Berkeley, CA.\n* University of Chicago Law School, University of Chicago, in Chicago, IL.\n* University of Michigan Law School, University of Michigan, in Ann Arbor, MI.\n* University of Pennsylvania Law School, University of Pennsylvania, in Philadelphia, PA.\n* University of Virginia School of Law, University of Virginia, in Charlottesville, VA.\n* Yale Law School, Yale University, in New Haven, CT.\n\n\nDo the T-14 schools really make a difference? (courtesy LaxAttack09, stacy, and brand_182)\n\nYes....if you define exit opportunities and job after graduation with $$ (which most people do) then most certainly so. Firms (the one that pay the big $$) will dip much lower into NYU's class then, say, Notre Dame. While it may be possible to get that 160k job out of Notre Dame, you're gonna have to finish top 10% for it to be almost guaranteed. Whereas if you go to NYU, you're almost guaranteed a job like that if you finish in the top 75%. Now, is there a difference between Georgetown (14) and texas/la/sc/vandy (15-20 range)? A little, but not as much. Georgetown is seen as a \"national\" school, whereas many of the schools after Georgetown at 14 are seen as more regional schools.\n\nYes. T14 schools have more recruiters from more firms, place more students in clerkships and public interest fellowships, and have alums in a larger number of prestigious positions. while it's possible for grads of any law school to get jobs, most employers will go \"deeper\" into the pool of T14 students (ie, they might interview only the top 10% of students at a lower-ranked school, and all students at a T14). T14s also tend to have better public interest loan repayment programs than lower-ranked schools.\n\nThe difference between T14 and a top 25 school or something is pretty minor, but if you can get into a T14 I'd think twice about going to a much lower-ranked school, unless:\n\na) the lower-ranked school is in a city or town that you're positive you'd like to stay in (ie, if you know you want to work in Montana, the university there would be a better choice than almost anywhere else)\nb) you're very sure you don't want a firm job, a clerkship, or a job as a professor or judge, AND the T14 to which you've been admitted doesn't have a good loan repayment program, AND the lower-ranked school has given you a huge scholarship.\n\nJudging by the average salary/job placement/bar pass rate of T14 schools, I'd argue that going to a T14 does give one significant advantages. I do, however, think the T14 can be too limited a scope as there are schools outside of it (UT, USC, Vanderbilt, GWU, etc.) that place well and are well regarded. At the same time, where you received your JD seems to be far more important than where you received your BA in the profession of law so there would have to be some pretty big incentives to make me pick a non T14 over a T14.\n\nTo how many law schools should I apply? (courtesy im_blue)\n\nThe best and worst applicants have the fewest schools to consider. Someone with T-14 numbers may choose to apply only to T-14 schools with 1 or 2 safeties, while someone with 3rd or 4th tier numbers should apply to the few schools in the area they wish to practice in. The people applying to 30 schools are those just below the cusp of the T-14, who apply to most of them as reach schools, several semi-national schools in the T-25, and a few regional safeties. Of course, there are always some people who overapply to reaches and safeties.\n\n\nIt depends, If you're a good student and you prep for the LSAT then it is not incredibly hard to get into a law school. Here is some data from U.S. News's Ultimate guide to law schools: the least selective law school has a 25th-75th Percentile GPA range of 2.58-3.23 and an LSAT range of 144-149. I believe that if you are a good student and prep for the LSAT then you can get into a law school.\n\nAcceptances into California Law Schools and Top Law Schools --> Career Center - Profile of Law School Admissions - UC Berkeley\n\nWhat are the admission factors for law school? (courtesy jonri, sallyawp and hayden)\n\nLaw schools can do whatever they want in terms of admitting people and there's really not one way they all do it. But keep in mind that law schools don't have varsity athletic teams and orchestras, newspapers, intramurals, etc. except those organized by students just for fun. Perhaps even more importantly, everyone \"\"majors\" in the same subject. There is no need to admit some classics majors, some pre-meds, some English types, etc. The end result is that you can forget the undergraduate admissions model for top schools that you are used to.\n\nMy own take is that about 80% of law school admissions is about two numbers:LSAT and GPA. How much weight each law school gives to these two factors varies a bit among law schools. Everything else counts about 20%. Roughly half of that 20% is made up of factors you have no control over: URM status, legacy status, celebrity/develpmental admits, geographic diversity or in-state preference (depending on whether it's a regional school trying to become more national or a state U.) (That's not an exhaustive list.)\n\nAll the rest--how early in the admissions cycle you apply, the college you attended, your LORs, your recs, your work experience, military service, community service, your ECs, the difficulty of your course work, etc.--make up about 10% FOR MOST people.\n\nAre there exceptions when these can count more? Yes. But two years of work experience and good LORs from two profs aren't going to get someone with a gpa and LSAT score at the 25th percentile into a top law school.\n\nMOST of the time at most--not all, but most--law schools, if your LSAT and GPA are both above the 75th percentile, you'll get in. However, it is also true --and isn't, IMO appreciated enough on this board--that you can shoot yourself in the foot even if you have perfect #s. Blow off the personal statement or submit two LORs that say \"he took my class; he got a good grade\" and you can--despite near perfect #s--be rejected, especially at the law schools at the top of the totem pole. But the converse really isn't true--all those other things can't make up for weak #s unless they are extraordinary.\n\nWhen your GPA and LSAT are within the 25/75% range, other factors come into play. My observation (which is purely anecdotal) is that when you are in the 50%-75% zone at top 14 schools, you need SOMETHING else. It doesn't have to be extraordinary, but if you don't have some ECs or work experience or internships, you aren't going to get in UNLESS you are above the 75th percentile (and even that won't work at Yale and Stanford.) But it doesn't have to be anything outstanding. When you are in the 25-50% zone, then the other things will matter more--and they do have to be significant. For example, if you played a Division I sport, you'll get cut some slack on the gpa, especially if you have a good LSAT.\n\nRemember to that it varies a bit among law schools--Northwestern, for example, weighs work experience more heavily than most other law schools.\n.....\nLet's not overgeneralize here, though. It is quite clear that generally, if you don't have a high enough GPA and strong enough LSAT scores, your probability of getting into a T14 law school is greatly diminished. However, simply having a high GPA and strong LSAT scores does not guarantee you admission to a top law school. For example, having a 3.7 GPA and a 170 on your LSATs puts you squarely within the category of people that is likely to be admitted to one or more T14 law schools, but there are many others with similar qualifications vying for spots in T14 entering classes.\n\nYou need to make yourself stand out -- and not in a negative way. Your application needs to be clean, neat, spell-checked and free of typos. You need to have a well written, thoughtful (and again, spell-checked and free of typos) personal statement, even if it isn't the kind of essay that would knock someone's socks off (though that could only help). Don't underestimate how important these factors are.\n\nYou also need some decent recommendations and a few things on your resume that show that you didn't spend your four years of college locked away in a library or a lab. Try to show that you are not socially inept. The stronger your activities, leadership positions, work experience, recommendations, etc. are, the more likely you are to make an impression on someone whose voice matters in the admissions process. Are over-the-top, stellar activities and recommendations absolutely necessary? Perhaps not -- but the absence of activities and mediocre recommendations could kill an otherwise stellar-on-the-numbers application. Admissions professionals have to make assumptions about who a person is and how likely they are to add to the classroom discourse, law school community and ultimately, to succeed in the legal profession, from a few pages of writing. Do you want to have negative inferences drawn because you had nothing to offer other than a high LSAT score? I wouldn't.\n...\n\nDon't get arrested. A good idea, of course, even if you don't plan on law school . . . .\n\nQuestions about Recommendation Letters (courtesy Student615 and massguy)\n\nIs the number of recommendations important?\n\nLSAC has a list of every law school and how many letters they require/prefer/accept (the list definitely has require/accept, and I *think* it sometimes has prefer, but I'm not positive). I had three b/c they were all from people who knew me in very different ways, and they were all pretty different recs. I would definitely say that it's better to have two great recs than two great and one or two \"fine\" (not b/c they don't say good things about you, but because they don't really add anything). Having talked to other (non-law) admissions reps, they just want a well-rounded picture of you, and they don't want redundancy.\n\n\nYes. In general, writing recommendations is part of being a professor. And on top of that, the LSAC LOR service makes the whole process pretty painless, relative to those of other grad programs. They won't have to fill out any paperwork/worksheets for each school...just one letter, sent to one place, by one pretty flexible deadline (if a LOR arrives after you've applied to a school, LSAC will sent an updated report to that school). If you plan to ask each professor to write directed, rather than general letters, then the process will be a bit more involved, but this shouldn't be necessary in too many cases. Regardless, yes...get the best rec letters you can. Just ease the process as much as possible: plenty of advance notice, pre-addressed/stamped envelopes, polite reminders/follow-ups, a nice thank you, and so forth.\n\nDo I need a letter from someone in my current program?\n\nNo idea, but my guess is no. Usually you're told to get recs from people who know you well, and you're told that academic recs are strongly desired, most important, or whatever (b/c presumably, people who know you in an academic setting can best address your potential as a law student). Whether this person is from undergrad or your current program is probably not an issue, although I suppose some schools could specify otherwise.

(courtesy dadofsam)\n\nLitigation/trial lawyers, especially criminal trial lawyers, are about the only field of law that most people are acquainted with, since most other fields of law lack the drama to be the subject of television shows, movies or plays. However, most lawyers don't work in those fields.\n\n\"Corporate law\" is a name generally given to working for large companies, either as an attorney employed by a large company, or in a law firm working for large company clients. It has many sub-areas.\nPractically all fields of law have no connection to subjects taught in college, although in a number of areas of law material learned in college can be useful at least as background knowledge.\n\nSome fields of law are family law (marriages, divorces, adoptions, etc.), bankruptcy law, real estate law, general business or contract law, environmental law, medical and other malpractice law, public health law, administrative law (law involving government agencies and how to deal with them), maritime law, space law, insurance law, estate planning (wills, for instance) - and there are others.\n\n\nThe actual practice of law involves a lot of mundane procedures and documents. It involves dealing with clients who are not always reasonable. It involves dealing with senior attorneys who direct your life (for how long depends on the type of practice you enter). It involves dealing with billing. It involves deadlines. It involves dealing with other attorneys - sometimes in adversarial situations, sometimes not - and many of these other lawyers will be people who thrive on confrontation, argument, and strong opinions.\n\nWhat you found least appealing - the anxiety - may the aspect that is most typical of the practice of law. There is a lot of pressure. Whether it is imposed from the client, the partner, the court, the government agency, whatever, there is a lot of pressure. People who do well in the practice of law are often those who find that pressure invigorating, who see is as a challenge and thrive on it.\n\nHow Much Money Do Lawyers Make? (courtesy s1185)\n\nEmpirical Legal Studies: Distribution of 2006 Starting Salaries: Best Graphic Chart of the Year\n\nWhat are the qualifications needed to obtain a job as a lawyer? (courtesy dadofsam)\n\nWhen you apply for a position in law, whether it's a summer associate spot or a full-time associate, you have certain qualifications.\nIf you have not worked much, have been mainly a student since kindergarten, you have only four or five areas of qualifications:\n1) law school grades,\n2) law school class standing,\n3) the law school itself (maybe),\n4) possible extra efforts such as being on law review, or another journal or a competitive moot court team and\n5) possible extraneous work such as in a legal clinic.\n\nLack of any of these, such as a so-so GPA, can mean an overall lack of a major category of your resume. So, especially as a student or recent graduate, your grades are very important. Later in life, your experience and, if you are private practice, your ability to generate business, becomes much more important than any of these.\n\nIs it realistic to believe that going to law school will give me the knowledge to help with international human rights issues? (courtesy sallyawp)\n\nIt is realistic to believe that there are international human rights jobs which require a law degree and the knowledge acquired in law school. However, these jobs are exceedingly hard to come by--a lot of people go into law school wanting to do \"international human rights work\" so there's a lot of competition. If you want to work for Amnesty or a similar organization, I'd look at their employment pages and see what qualifications are required for the jobs you'd like--the answer may surprise you, because it may not be a law degree! (oh, and just by the way, working for Amnesty is definitely NOT a great way to smooth your path to becoming a judge. you might want to look into what supreme and circuit court judges were doing prior to their nominations).\n\nIs it a waste of money to get a law degree and not to be a big law lawyer? (courtesy sallyawp)\n\nWell, yes, in the sense that there are shorter/cheaper educational programs that will prepare you for jobs that pay just as much as being a lawyer at a small firm or nonprofit. But people make decisions that \"waste\" money all the time: not everyone goes into the field that could maximize their earning potential. They have kids (HUGE waste of money or buy a fancy car or take up scuba diving. Why? Because they get some joy or status out of it that is worth more to them than having the money in their bank account. If, in your mind, non-firm job + the constraints of a lower salary > firm job + opportunities provided by a higher salary, then it may make sense to take a job elsewhere. Plus, it's not an either-or thing...people switch among firms, in-house, government, non-profit jobs throughout their careers.

This statement also portrays loneliness as extremely negative. Loneliness can be negative if psychological but physical loneliness need not be a bad thing.\nIn the modern world, life is very stressful due to a majority of people having a busy schedule throughout the week. Such persons might prefer being alone on weekends as opposed to going out and meeting friends. However, this does not mean that they are cut off from their friends. This is where the technological tools come in. Computers, mobile phones, internet telephony, video conferencing and social networking are a few examples of the technological advancements that have helped bring people closer without having to step out of their homes. This has no doubt, contributed to increased physical loneliness as there is lesser need to catch up with your friends at a coffee shop, shopping mall or movie theater than there was perhaps a decade ago. Why would a person take the trouble of dressing up and travelling to the meeting place to have a conversation with friends when one could have the same conversation in the comfort of one's home, without the bothersome add-ons?\nAt the same time, technological advances have helped reduce physical loneliness when it comes to the aviation and railway industries. It is speedier, easier and much more convenient to travel to meet your family, friends and loved ones than it ever was in comparatively technologically backward times.\nComing to psychological loneliness, technology has played a great role in reducing loneliness with a single click of the mouse. A person can chat with a friend sitting in another continent, without the danger of running up inordinately high telephone bills, because of one of the marvels of modern technology- internet telephony.  Another tool by which technology has helped reduce psychological loneliness is social networking sites, where it is much easier for a person to find and befriend like-minded people with similar interests, careers or hobbies and hence, further their  personal, emotional and even financial growth.\nThe development of technological tools and how human society uses them has helped do away with loneliness by aiding in the formation of bonds that help people grow and expand their horizons while also giving them a sense of security at having family and friends close at hand at just the touch of a button.\n\n>>\"Our declining environment may bring the people of the world together as no politician, philosopher, or war ever could. Environmental problems are global in scope and respect no nation's boundaries. Therefore, people are faced with the choice of unity and cooperation on the one hand or disunity and a common tragedy on the other.\"<<\n\nThe deteriorating environmental health of our planet may be a harbinger of what is to befall us if it is allowed to go on unchecked. The consequences of these environmental problems affect the entire planet, not just the people of any one country, leaving every human being equally susceptible to them. All people must come together to prevent further damage to the environment and must seek to improve it by all possible means if Earth is to remain a habitable planet. Human survival depends on this collaboration and cooperative effort.\nConsequently, the unifying effect of the global impact of these problems is much larger than that of any politician, philosopher or war. There are always people who do not support a certain politician or do not subscribe to the same school of thought as a particular philosopher or do not think of war as the correct way of resolving issues. However, when it comes to survival, it is innate in every human being to come together to fight for it. Our future is endangered because of the current environmental problems.\nAll of these problems have been created by us. Air, water and land pollution, toxic chemicals, deforestation, ozone depleting gases are only a few of the ways in which we have brought upon ourselves the changed environmental conditions we face today. The resultant phenomenon of global warming is causing widespread climate change including melting of the arctic ice, changed weather patterns and seasonal cycles as well as endangering various species.\nThe negative impact of global warming is immense in its scope. Melting of the polar ice caps will increase sea level and result in flooding and subsequent submersion of low lying coastal regions. This translates into a massive loss of land and lesser area for humans to occupy. Changing weather patterns will impact agricultural seasons and crop cultivation and yield leading to food scarcity. Already, an increase in the number and intensity of hurricanes is being observed resulting in colossal property damage and loss of life.\nThe only recourse to these environmental problems is to join hands and work together across borders to prevent and if possible, reverse the damage caused to our planet. Concerted efforts must be made to check pollution and deforestation. Stringent rules for emissions and recycling must be drawn up to which all nations must adhere. Every country should seek to minimize toxic emissions and maximize eco-friendly options. People all over the world must ensure that their governments abide by environment friendly practices if we are to combat this disease called global warming.\nIf we fail to unite and fight against the declining environmental conditions, then the future of the human race and all other species is in jeopardy.\n\n>>\"Six months ago the region of Forestville increased the speed limit for vehicles traveling on the region's highways by ten miles per hour. Since that change took effect, the number of automobile accidents in that region has increased by 15 percent. But the speed limit in Elmsford, a region neighboring Forestville, remained unchanged, and automobile accidents declined slightly during the same six-month period. Therefore, if the citizens of Forestville want to reduce the number of automobile accidents on the region's highways, they should campaign to reduce Forestville's speed limit to what it was before the increase.\"<<\n\nThat the increase in the highway speed limit in Forestville resulted in an increase in automobile accidents is quite possible but this increase cannot be attributed solely to this reason.\nThe rise in the number of accidents may have been due to bad roads in the Forestville region as well as due to poor lighting and lack of adequate signboards which may result in a driver losing control of the vehicle and having an accident. Poor patrolling by the highway police may be another reason for this increase as rash driving and drunk driving would go unchecked.\nIn the same way, Elmsford region's decrease in the number of automobile accidents may be attributed to not only a comparatively lower speed limit but also to better roads and lighting, well lit signboards and directions. Efficient highway patrolling in Elmsford could be an additional reason to the decline in the number of accidents as it acts as a deterrent for those flouting the rules and safety regulations.\nAnother flaw in the argument is that it does not state sufficient data to draw the said conclusion. The 15 percent increase when converted to actual figures could also be a small number of accidents. For instance, an increase of 15 percent from 20 accidents to 23 accidents is a minor increase. The severity of the accidents is also not stated. These accidents might have been a few scratches to the car or may have been fatal. If the actual rise in the number of accidents and their severity is insubstantial, then the increased speed limit cannot be held culpable.\nHence, the citizens of Forestville should survey other reasons, such as the aforementioned factors, that contribute to a greater rate of automobile accidents and should also look to Elmsford's highway policies in order to make their highways safer.\n\n\n\nThank you soooooooooo much if you got till this line!!

Junior year had major breakdown, dx major depressive disorder with anorexia, self-harm, etc. She had to drop her full-I.B. courseload and is now attending school only for 3 morning classes, and taking Virtual High School classes on line at home. happily, now that meds and therapy are underway, the depression is definitely improving. However, we still need to attend to the academic issues. The school initiated testing and we just got the results. Need to get a handle on this before we go in to speak with them, since I foresee that we may need to be strong advocates in order to get them to do anything, since it's not a typical \"learning disability\" situation.\n\nWAIC IV results:\nFull IQ = 133\nVCI = 147\nPRI = 127\nWMI = 100\nPSI = 124\n\nThe administering psychologist wrote that while her WMI of 100 is just \"average\", and therefore not an immediately glaring problem, in a person of such otherwise high intellect the discrepancy between the scores can be a major problem, causing spiraling academic problems as the person experiences frustration and disappointment with their grades, contributing to more anxiety and eventually depression as we've seen.\n\nWIAT III\nTotal = 134\nmath fluency = 88 (!)\neverything else in the 113-150 range, with Oral Word Fluency being 150 (!)\n\nI have thought for years that my daughter is extremely bright but has issues with concentration, attention, study skills, work organization, self-monitoring, etc, so these results are somewhat comforting in that my intuition was right! But what do we do now?\n\nHere is a kid who is clearly very intelligent and could do great things. However, she often does very poorly in school. I feel that these test results show that she has an actual reason for her problems, not that she's simply lazy or a slacker. She articulated to me (after reading these results) that she DOES want to find a way to overcome these issues so that she can be more successful. (She really wants to go to a selective college, too, and knows she needs to figure this handicap out to both get accepted and to succeed once there.)\n\nSo my questions are:\n\n1) Should I ask for further testing to tease out what's behind this? Is the school likely to give that to us? Would it even be helpful?\n\n2) What, if any, strategies are there to help a kid in this situation? Are there specific types of therapy or tutoring that can help a 16-year-old improve at this point?\n\n3) At the IEP meeting, if the school does not offer much, or any, help, what should we ask for? What accomodations in school could help my daughter succeed?\n\nShe is SUCH a very intellingent, creative, curious, marvelous girl, and it just breaks my heart to see her slipping through the cracks like this. If she could just get a handle on how to listen better, how to study, how to self-assess before tests, how to read instructions more carefully, how to do basic arithmetic (she always gets the higher concepts very quickly but then messes up on some multiplication or division in the actual problem! Every tutor she's worked with is dismayed when she fails tests after showing high-level knowledge of the concepts!)..... if she could just improve those she could do so well.\n\nAny thoughts greatly appreciated.\n\nStacey                "}, {"date": "2004-12-21T14:18:27+00:00", "url": "http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/university-chicago/19524-rate-my-essay.html", "messages": "\n                    the teleclone topic\n\nThe ultimate philosophical quandary, pondered by thinkers since before the days of Socrates, is the question of the existence and nature of the human soul. To some, we are merely complex biological machines, no more than smart monkeys whose consciousness is solely the construction of what is physically measurable inside our brains. Others insist there exists something more inside of us, something eternal\u0097our self, our greater consciousness, the perennial spirit that sits behind the controls of our physical body. Our soul. We humans like to believe that we are not ephemeral. The thought that death is truly the end of us, and that we, along with our thoughts and memories, rot in the grave along with our bodies, is very disconcerting. Pondering the idea of an eternal and final end too deeply can bring about a full-fledged panic attack, so its no surprise that there exist a multitude of different theories as to what we are beyond our bodies. What would happen to an astronaut that steps into a Teleclone Mark IV depends entirely on whether or not a soul exists, and, if it does, the nature of that soul. While it is obviously impossible to determine for sure what would happen, it is possible to outline the different possibilities.\n\nOne advantage we have over the Socratic philosophers is our advanced scientific knowledge of the human brain. While our brains do not yet fully understand their own inner workings, we do know that what we think, value, and remember is measurable and quantifiable in electrical or chemical terms. Thus Socrates\u0092 argument to Cebes about knowledge amounting to the soul\u0092s recollection of eternal absolutes holds less weight today because we know that our knowing is not some abstract, spiritual quality, but holds firm ground in the physical world. Suppose for this example that no soul exists. If the Teleclone used preexisting atoms on Earth to produce an exact copy of the astronaut on Mars, the new brain would contain the exact same balance of chemicals as the old one, and therefore the same thoughts and memories. The brain of the Earth-astronaut would remember stepping into the Teleclone, closing his eyes and crossing his fingers, and would then experience opening his eyes on Earth. The Mars-astronaut, however, was destroyed. The brain of that body would experience destruction as the switch was thrown. Thus, if no soul exists and we are nothing more than our physical brains, the original astronaut is killed and a new one is created. But the new one wouldn\u0092t \u0093feel\u0094 like he was just created. His brain remembers being on Mars a few seconds ago, so he would believe the teleportation was a total success. He would insist that he was the original astronaut, and so would everyone else who knew him. But in actually, he is a new consciousness separate from the original, since the old one was destroyed back on Mars. As conscious beings, we live solely in the present\u0097what we consider the past is a construction based on information stored in the brain.\n\nBut suppose that our consciousness is not just the sum of the chemicals in our brain, and that we have some sort of \u0093soul\u0094 that we do not yet have the technology to measure or quantify. What would happen in this case depends on the nature of the soul. If the soul is somehow grounded in the physical realm of three dimensions, then we could assume the Teleclone would be capable of interacting with it along with the rest of our bodies. Consequently, the soul would be \u0093destroyed\u0094 and \u0093created\u0094 along with the rest of the body. In this case, the result would be the same as in the previous instance: the old person would be killed and a new one \u0093born.\u0094 However, since in this case the machine is tampering with a soul and not just a body, it is possible that the new astronaut would be spiritually unbalanced. He might, subconsciously and intrinsically, know that he is not truly the original astronaut but has been created in an instant by a machine. The new astronaut would likely suffer deep psychological trauma for the rest of his life and be plagued by demonic hallucinations. As Victor Frankenstein learned, humans aren\u0092t meant to tamper with that unknown force that animates the inanimate. If a Teleclone is created that is capable of destroying and creating souls, the results could be terrible and terrifying.\n\nOr, perhaps the soul cannot be destroyed or created by the Teleclone. What would happen in this case depends on the way our soul is linked to our body. If our soul is \u0093inside\u0094 or somehow permanently tethered to our body, then Mars-astronaut\u0092s body is destroyed but the soul is left behind, and it goes wherever souls go when the body is dead. A new body is created on Earth, but it has no soul, and it immediately collapses into a lifeless heap. The teleportation appears a failure.\n\nOr, perhaps our souls either exist in another plane or are not permanently linked to the body they inhabit. In this case, it is likely our souls would \u0093know\u0094 our body by some sort of physical blueprint or serial number. The new body on Earth would be an exact copy and thus have the same \u0093serial number.\u0094 So, the soul would think its body was dead for a moment, but then suddenly realize that its body was on Earth and retake control of the reigns. The Mars-astronaut and the Earth-Astronaut would then be the same person, soul, and consciousness. The teleportation is a success.\nAs for the updated Teleclone Mark V that doesn\u0092t destroy the original body, the results would be similar. In a world without souls or with physical souls, it would be a simple cloning machine that produces two distinct persons. In the case of tethered souls, the new body would be lifeless. In the case of souls that are capable of moving into the new body there are two possibilities. One possibility is the new body would be lifeless. Or, it is possible that since the two bodies had the same \u0093serial number,\u0094 the soul would believe them to be the same body, and thus, it would take control of both bodies and the person would be two people at once.  Or at the very least, two different people with the same soul.\n\nI do not know which of these scenarios would be the one that actually takes place in the event that someone were to actually construct a Teleclone Mark IV. What I do know is that grads at UChicago will be the first ones to build it, and I sure as hell don\u0092t want to be the person to test it out. Perhaps some Ivy students can be tricked into being the test subjects.

I have no frame of reference and am lost once again.\n\nD is now a rising senior, on track to graduate with the first degree next year, and the second degree midway through year five, a D-1 varsity athlete, the athletic conference representative for the school, and president of the athletic governance council on the school senate.  Some weeks ago the head coach of her team told her that D is needed as a leader on the team.  So, D ran for team captain in an election that took place some days ago.\n\nPrior to the election, D called me to say that it appeared the vote would be split, and half the team wasn't likely to vote for her - I was on business travel at the time and couldn't focus much, but I gave her the best advice that I could think of, which was that she should meet with the team members who she thought would NOT vote for her, talk to them one on one, and try to learn their thoughts, needs, etc. - what did they want and expect from their team captain?  D did that, took careful notes, and the information came back that these persons thought she was too aggressive, that they couldn't confide in her, etc.  Comparatively, the team members who wanted D as team captain are the more competitive, results oriented members.\n\nWhen D called to say she lost the election, I advised her to immediately send congrats to the winner, and be supportive and positive, etc., which she did.\n\nYesterday, she had her scheduled end-of-year meeting with the head coach.  Normally a 30-minute discussion, the meeting went on for two hours.  In this discussion, D raised the issue of the election and the outcome.  The abridged version - and the reason for my post - is that the head coach said that while D \"has the greatest leadership potential of anyone on the team\", the athletic department staff as a group did not want her to win the election, because she is too aggressive; when she sets a goal she goes after it at all costs with no regard for the feelings of teammates; she doesn't give people time to come around to her way of thinking; she has not learned how to make people \"want\" to follow her vs. simply taking charge.  In addition, when something is \"wrong\", D is too aggressive in challenging it, and is actually \"relentless\" in her pursuit of corrective action, and the athletic staff does not like this.\n\nO.K. so far - except that somehow the discussion deteriorated into (I'm not sure how - I'm waiting for the next call from D to get the rest of the details) the coach saying that she was on a trip to Australia recently, and that this country is far better than the U.S. because Americans are too driven and too aggressive, as well as cynical.  D responded to this by saying that America is the strongest economy in the world, first in inventions, first in scientific achievement, first in military strength, first in services to its citizens, first in quality of life and education, first in opportunity, first in (this goes on), and, thank you very much, but D said she'll stick with her American ideology.\n\nI asked D - how did the coach respond to this?  D said that coach referenced a book about abused children, and recommended D read it - in particular a section about children from single parent homes.  She said that \"I'm sure your mother is a wonderful person, however, since she is a single parent it is likely that a lot of your aggressiveness and relentless pursuit of goals without regard for obstacles is a result of being raised in a single parent environment\":  this must be why D has such a \"take on the world\" attitude, as well as a \"very cynical and negative view of the world\".\n\nHere's where my confusion comes in.  D is upset, and feels that her political beliefs as well as her family structure have been attacked, and furthermore that these elements have no place, and should not have ever come up in her end-of-year meeting with this head coach.  She called me to say that she wishes to follow up, either by email or with a second discussion:  what should she do, and what should she say?\n\nThere is some truth to what the head coach is saying:  I do think D is too aggressive and results-oriented and needs to work on balancing this with concerns for others who might not share her goals, or the strategies to achieve those goals.  But on the other hand, this doesn't manifest with D in other leadership positions - for example, she served on the senate section for athletes before being elected its president for next year; in her athletic council position she has broadened the reach of the program, and has even brought speakers and other events back to campus.  And, I'm astonished and offended at the parts of the discussion related to politics, and products of single parent homes.  This last has me very concerned:  the way D described it, it's an unfair blanket indictment.\n\nI'm lost on how to advise D.  I've met this coach several times on campus and at competitions; we have an arms-length relationship, as is appropriate for parents.\n\nMy instinct is to tell D to listen to the components of what the coach said that will help her grow as a leader, but discard the rest:  she's never going to learn anything from persons who agree with her 100% of the time.\n\nThe other option is for me to reach out to the coach, along the lines of \"I need some help understanding what you said to D, so that I can help to support those areas that you raised where D may need to work on leadership skills\".  But I am not sure if this is an appropriate thing for a parent to do.  (Isn't this sort of like calling a professor if the college student has a problem in class?)\n\nThe last option is for me to take three huge steps back, and tell D that it is up to her to negotiate her relationships.

That finding is an example of how real-world behavior can be changed by immersing people in virtual reality environments \u0096 a notion that is at the heart of work under way in Stanford's Virtual Human Interaction Lab.\n\nSteve Fyffe\n\nUnderstanding the interplay between virtual and actual reality is at the heart of the work under way in Associate Professor of Communications Jeremy Bailenson's Virtual Human Interaction Lab.\n\nBY ADAM GORLICK\n\nIf a tree falls in a virtual reality forest, will anyone hear an environmental message?\n\nThey will, as long as they were the ones who cut down the make-believe redwood.\n\nNew findings from Stanford researchers show that people who were immersed in a three-dimensional virtual forest and told to saw through a towering sequoia until it crashed in front of them later used less paper in the real world than people who only imagined what it's like to cut down a tree.\n\n\"We found that virtual reality can change how people behave,\" said Sun Joo Ahn, whose doctoral dissertation outlines the findings. \"That's the big result. When people are in virtual reality and going through the motions of actually cutting down this tree, it might make them feel more personally accountable or responsible for the damage that occurred.\"\n\nAhn's work is among the latest batch of studies to come from Stanford's Virtual Human Interaction Lab. Led by Jeremy Bailenson, associate professor of communication, researchers in the lab are trying to better understand how advances in digital media like 3-D movies and interactive video games are affecting people's real-life experiences. And they want to know how those technologies can influence and change people's behavior.\n\n\"People want \u0096 and are becoming more used to \u0096 immersive media experiences,\" said Bailenson, co-author of the recently released book Infinite Reality: Avatars, Eternal Life, New Worlds, and the Dawn of the Virtual Revolution. \"You're going to need more than an instructional video or a pamphlet to explain something that requires a change in behavior. You need to make people feel like they're literally engaged.\"\n\nIn one of her studies, Ahn had about 50 people read some information about how the use of non-recycled paper leads to deforestation.\n\nShe then had one group of subjects read an account of what happens when a chainsaw buzzes through a tree. The piece was rich with detail, describing the chirping birds in the forest, the sound and vibration of the saw and the snapping of branches that comes with the crash of the mighty redwood.\n\nA second group of subjects didn't read the description, but instead were plunged into the virtual forest. Outfitted with a helmet-like device that cut off their vision from the real world and surrounded them with the sights and sounds of a computerized woodland, they felt like they were there.\n\nUsing a special joystick called a haptic device, the subjects were able to control the back-and-forth motions of the chainsaw that their virtual selves used to cut down the tree. As they sawed for about three minutes, the haptic device vibrated in their hands to simulate the feeling of the real thing.\n\nRegardless of which group they were in, all the participants said they had a stronger belief that their personal actions could improve the quality of the environment compared to how they felt before they either read about tree cutting or chopped down an evergreen in the fake forest.\n\nBut when it came time to put that belief into practice, only the tree choppers cut their paper use.\n\nBefore letting them leave the lab, Ahn had the subjects in both groups sit at a desk and fill out some forms. She placed a stack of paper napkins and a glass of water on the desk and pretended to accidentally knock the glass over. The subjects reflexively grabbed napkins to clean the spill, and Ahn later counted how many were used.\n\nThose who only read about logging used an average of 20 percent more napkins than the virtual lumberjacks.\n\n\"This study isn't all about trees,\" said Ahn, who will receive her PhD this summer and begin teaching as an assistant professor at the University of Georgia's Grady College of Journalism and Mass Communication in the fall.\n\n\"It's about how we are able to use an immersive virtual environment to create a change in behavior in the physical world,\" she said. \"We showed that just three minutes of an embodied experience could produce a behavioral result.\"\n\nThat implies that repeated or long-term exposure to virtual reality scenarios can produce even more dramatic results, she said.\n\nAnd understanding that interplay between virtual and actual reality is at the heart of the work under way in Bailenson's lab. Long a proving ground for studies that show how interacting with an avatar can motivate someone to increase their retirement savings, exercise more or vote for a particular politician, the lab is going through a transformation of its own.\n\nExpected to open by the end of April, a newly built space for virtual reality research will feature what Bailenson calls the world's most technologically advanced \"multi-sensory room\" \u0096 an area that integrates sight, sound and touch into one immersive digital experience.\n\nTest subjects will experience the virtual world with a head-mounted display that will give them complete peripheral vision and a 360-degree view of whatever landscape Bailenson and his researchers design. The room will have 24 speakers that mimic the movement of sound: Imagine watching a virtual bird flying by your eyes as the sound of its tweeting and chirping follows along.\n\n\"If you've seen a movie in a really state-of-the-art theater with great surround sound, this is like that \u0096 but on steroids,\" Bailenson said.\n\nThe new lab will also feature a floor that moves and shakes, allowing researchers to duplicate the feel of earthquakes, approaching footsteps and explosions.\n\n\"The next time a tree crashes,\" Bailenson said, \"it will shake your boots.\"                "}, {"date": "2005-09-11T18:38:32+00:00", "url": "http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/sat-act-tests-test-preparation/96560-what-score-should-i-get.html", "messages": "\n                    I took practice test number 2 of the CB Online Course today, and I was wondering what score you think I should get (rather than the large range it spits out).

What do you guys think my actual scores would be?\n\nAlso, I am not sure if I should believe the instant-automated essay scoring.  Can you read my essay to see if you agree with the 12?\n\nQuestion:  \"Are bad choices and good choices equally likely to have negative consequences?\"\n\nMy response:\n\nNo matter what decisions people make, there is always a possibility of negative consequences. Though people like to believe that making a good decision will have positive results, the truth is that an apparently good decision can have results that are ust as bad as a seemingly poor decision. This is because people cannot predict the future. What looks like a terrific hoice at one moment can prove to be a detrimental decision further in time. Literature and my personal experience provide compelling examples of this fact.\n\nVoltaire's \"Candide\" shows that good results can be caused by bad decisions. Candide and Cacambo have serendipitously stumbled upon the city of Eldorado. This city is an absolute paradise, perfect in every way. But Candide and his friend get bored and decide to leave. This is a very bad decision. After they leave and go back to Europe, however, the decision proves to have beneficial results. candide finds his long lost love, Cunegonde, and his cherished philoshophy professor, Dr. Pangloss. This reuniting shows that bad decisions can produce good events.\n\nMy personal experience in high school shows that good decisions can have negative ramifications. In 10th grade, when I was choosing my classes for the following year, I decided to opt for learning Greek. This seemed like a great decision, because it is a rare language to learn in high school, and it would be very interesting. But the next year, when I began learning Greek, I realized how boring the language actually was. Despite being proficient at Latin in prior years, I could not grasp Greek. Even worse, the school implemented a new rule requiring a two year commitment to Greek. I was stuck with a subject I hated for another year, and this kept me out of another AP class. My seemingly wonderful decision had horrible consequences.\n\nWhether a bad decision in literature or an apparently good decision is my own life, all choices have the same likelihood of produces negative effects. All we can do is make a decision and hope for the best.\n\n\nThanks.

First, Harvard was one of the schools where I was educated.  Second, Harvard sets the standards for everyone else.\n\nI. Introduction\n\nOn CC and elsewhere there is much discussion of how important very high achievements are.  However, less is said about whether these standards of achievement are accurate or useful.\n\nI have been particularly concerned when I see how extremely high standards make students and parents seek near perfection on so many measures of academic achievement.  As we all should know, perfectionism can have dramatic negative effects.  It leads to countless individuals devoting incredible amounts of time and money to do better and better on tests and grades.  Sometimes this means missing out on life and even real learning.\n\nII. Evidence of the overall inadequacy of current \u0093objective\u0094 measures\n\nThe measures used in admissions are based on their ability to accurately predict freshman GPA.   The main predictors are high school GPA (HSGPA), SAT I, and SAT II.\n\nUnfortunately none of these have proven very reliable.  The best study is probably the one done by the UC system.  I quote below the results.  For more info see http://www.fairtest.org/facts/satvalidity.html\n\n\u0093After a three-year validity study analyzing the power of the SAT I, SAT II, and high school grades to predict success at the state's eight public universities, University of California (UC) President Richard Atkinson presented a proposal in February 2001 to drop the SAT I requirement for UC applicants. The results from the UC validity study, which tracked 80,000 students from 1996-1999, highlighted the weak predictive power of the SAT I, with the test accounting for only 12.8% of the variation in FGPA. SAT II's and HSGPA explained 15.3% and 14.5% of the variation, respectively. After taking SAT II and HSGPA into account, SAT I scores improved the prediction rate by a negligible 0.1% (from 21.0% to 21.1%), making it a virtually worthless additional piece of information. Furthermore, SAT I scores proved to be more susceptible to the influence of the socioeconomic status of an applicant than either the SAT II or HSGPA.\u0094\n\nAnother way of saying this is that when a test like the SAT predicts 12.8% of freshman grades, 87.2% remains unaccounted for.  Even using SAT I, SAT II, and HSGPA and predicting 21% of freshman grades, means 79% is not accounted for.\n\nIII. More problems with the SAT\n\nIt is well known that the SAT has a standard error of around 30 points.  But fewer really think about the implications.  On CC, a score of 750 is often seen as a high enough level to apply to the most elite colleges.  This certainly applies to Harvard, where a 750 is sometimes seen on CC as almost a minimum.\n\nBut what a score of 750 actually means is that a person\u0092s true score is probably between 720-780.  Since this applies to all three SAT tests, the actual range of error for a person who got 750 on all three parts of the SAT for a total of 2250 actually is scoring somewhere between 2160-2340.  For a Harvard applicant, 2160 sounds terrible probably while 2340 sounds much better.\n\nStop and think of this.  Do you think of 780 as WAY higher than 720?  If so, you are making a mistake.  Then consider how it factors into the total SAT score.  There is no real difference between 2160 (720 times three) and  2340 (780 times three).  But is that how you think?  Is that how the admission officers think?\n\nIII. Conclusion\n\nElite universities such as Harvard have become used to making decisions based on measures that are not very reliable but which are seen to be very important.  People can actually think of themselves as an \u0093780\u0094 SAT person or a \u0093720\u0094 SAT person.  The fact that elite universities go along with this legitimizes this sort of error.\n\nI expect one response will be that no better measures are available.  Even if this were the case, this is not a good enough answer.  First, it doesn\u0092t excuse using the measures as if they were more reliable than they actually are (e.g., differentiating candidates on the basis of SAT differences that are not significant since they are within the margin of error).  Second, it should lead to efforts to either improve measures or find different ways of making decisions that are more consistent with reality.\n\nWhat do other CC members think?

Arriving in class 5 minutes late can mean the difference between life and death.\n- KNOW how lenient some substitute teachers are. I once got an essay grade of 97% in english even though i didn't start on it until the MORNING it was due - and my class is like at 7:55 AM. Okay, so what i did was this. I turned in the assignment with everyone else, then I told the substitute teacher that I forgot to print one of my pages out (the memory isn't that reliable - it might have been \"I need to staple my pages quickly) and quickly need to go back to the printer, so I did that, and I took like 5-10 minutes to go through the entire process. in reality i typed up the parts of the essay I didn't complete and then ran back to the english room and turned it in. luckily it WAS a substitute - I knew which substitute teachers tend not to notice.\n- KNOW the likelihood of a teacher not noticing something\n- KNOW when the consequences of your action will only likely result in being reprimanded\n- pretend to be forgetful from time to time in class, so that some of your mistakes will be attributable to your natural tendency to forget things. but don't be too irresponsible. this also depends on the teacher\n- don't get addicted to caffeine. Try to space out the periods you ingest caffeine so that there will be periodic days when your bloodstream will have no caffeine. This will prevent tolerance. Right now I'm pulling an all-nighter every two days, which is very possible because I always try to ensure that I have a caffeine free day in between so that the caffeine really works better when i actually am pulling an all-nighter.\n- if you're used to sleeping on beds, put all sorts of books on top of the bed and deny access to pillows and blankets while you're typing up your essays. i once started on a final project the day before it was due (IB dossier!) and i put so many of my books on the couch next to the room. I slept on the floor for like an hour (it's easy to wake up earlier when you sleep on the floor). this doesn't work as well if you have a clean floor though. I'm used to sleeping on the floor nowadays, so it doesn't work as well as it used to.\n- make \"accidents\". \"stay too long in the bathroom\". remember that the bathroom is an excellent excuse for so many things. as is forgetfulness. people tend to forgive people for \"incidents of staying in the bathroom for too long\" - because the same thing could easily happen to them.\n\n-if your school computers suck and take some time to load up microsoft word from e-mail or whatever, there is a better choice than e-mail. it's called wikipedia for transmitting notes and assignments - just create and edit your wiki userpage. when gmail takes a minute to load on some computers, that difference can be very critical\n- if there are time lags in assignment turn-in and assignment collection, you could sneak out of the room and back (especially if it's homeroom) to print out the edited paper and then to suddenly sneak your paper out again. ugh i forgot the exact process.\n\nfinally, a very excellent quote from t3h golub:\n\n"}, {"date": "2008-07-13T21:38:58+00:00", "url": "http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/college-search-selection/537439-dartmouth-pomonacollege-harveymudd-help.html", "messages": "\n                    Hi, thanks for reading this post.

If i major computer science at a liberal arts school, won't grad schools or employers view it as weak?)\n\nCons:\n-No one knows about it.\n-I have a limited amount of careers i can choose from.\n\nHarvey Mudd College\nPros:\nExcellent school, and teachers are easily accessible.\nI can take classes in the 5C.\nGood computer science, I hear.\nGood reputation, despite being a small college.\n\nCons:\nI read on this site that if you struggled through High school to get good grades, then Harvey Mudd isn't the place for you. Is that true? i worked my butt off in high school, and i did not excel in science; although i did do well in calculus and other subjects. Does it matter for Computer Science?\nI heard people there are really nerdy, and although i consider myself a nerd, i do have a social life.\nI can work really hard, but this past year, I realized i can't work hard without having time to breathe. It seems that Harvey Mudd would seriously kill me.\n\n\nDartmouth:\nPros:\nthe school also has a computer science department, but i'm not sure if it's that good, for Dartmouth IS a liberal arts school.\nSmall and intimate class sizes--seminars\nI can really develop my individuality here.\n\nCons:\nWorse weather than the other two.\nI want to work in the west in the future.

I'm really not sure what Dartmouth is good at... it seems like a school that will give you an experience and education than really a set path. That is exactly what i want, but is that a bad thing?\n\nWhere should i apply early decision to?? or is there any other school i should apply to??\n\nAll these schools have people that i'm sure that i would be comfortable living with throughout an entire year.\n\nI am also looking at Brown, Swarthmore, Yale, Rice.\nAlso, I'm starting to come out of the recent hype of being an engineer or working at a place like Google. My strong points do not lie there, but I don't know what else to consider. This past summer, I've thought of being either a professor, lawyer, and psychologist. One of my main debates is the whole career issue--how much money i'll make in the future and how easy it is to get a job. I actually thought of getting a philosophy major, but i was told that it is extremely unpractical, and i will be left without a job.\n\nShould i worry about that now? I cannot make up my mind yet.

My dream is being able to study in an Ivy League college in the United States, or another \"high ranked\" university.\nI did say \"dream\", however. That's because I don't know if my grades are actually competitive when translated to an American GPA. Does anyone know how I can compare our grading system (out of twenty) to the US GPA? I couldn't find any official ressources on the Web.\nMoreover, should I convert my grades and then use the result on the Common App? Or should I just not complete the \"GPA\" section and let the admissions office figure it out?\n\nI'm having a hard time filling out the Common Application.\nI know that all necessary ressources are supposed to be available, but there is information that I'm supposed to provide that has no real equivalent in my country, or that I'm not aware about: for example, school counselor (I've never met one), college/university affiliated courses (I am not aware of any organism in my city which provides access to university courses, will it play against me?), the \"courses I'm taking this year and their level (AP, IB) and credit value\" (I don't even know what all of this means), the academic honors (do they mean at exams?)...\nI'm really lost, I don't have a clue about where to start, how to fill this out.\nI also think that they ask for all high school years, but in France, 9th grade isn't considered as part of high school. Should I include it whatsoever?\nIf I am restricted and not able to carry out everything the colleges ask for in the best ways (eg. not having honors...) because of my country's educational system, will it subsequently affect my chances of being accepted?\n\nNow about admissions themselves.\nFirst of all, how important are grades (be they SAT, TOEFL or high school scores) compared to the extracurriculars, essays and recommendations? Can the latter really help at all if I know alumnus and professors? Do I absolutely have to include a team sport in my extracurriculars? I have several extras which I am really passionate about, but I don't play sports at all. Is it bad, and will it play against me in any way?\n\nIf I didn't get accepted to my target schools on first try, I've thought about several alternatives and would like to know which one of them is the most advisable: taking a leap year, transfering after a year, or reapplying for the following semester. Taking a leap year would imply traveling and getting some real life experience.\nFurthermore, is it true that the essay actually cuts it sometimes?\nLike, even if grades are somewhat bad, the essay can make one admissible if it is authentic and interesting enough, and most of all, justifies that lack of good results? I don't personally have bad results, though I did in early high school grade. But in 11th grade, I worked much more, and my results became higher.\nIs evolution taken into account, and will those mediocre grades I got during my freshman year give me less chances than someone who got great scores during all his high school years?\n\nWow, that was long, I suppose.

Thanks!\n\n\nAre people's lives the result of the choices they make?\n\n\n\nWhat goes around comes around. This adage may seem cliche, but it provides insight into a philosophy of life. People's lives are a result of the choices they make, and this is portrayed in Shakespeare's \"Macbeth,\" the Watergate Scandal, and Milton's \"Paradise Lost.\"\nIn Shakespeare's \"Macbeth,\" Macbeth and Lady Macbeth choose to murder in order to become royalty. Although they chose a life of royalty, they inadverdedly selected a doomed fate because they broke the natural law. Because of the multiple murders committed at their hands, both Macbeth and Lady Macbeth are punished as a result of their choices. Macbeth is ultimately killed and Lady Macbeth becomes insane. This justifies the claim that people's lives are a result of thier choices because both Macbeth and Lady Macbeth chose to kill, and as a result, they suffered at the end.\nAnother example is seen in the Watergate Scandal. Although he denied any personal involvement, Richard Nixon and his supporters chose to \"bug\" the Democrat Headquarters. By indirectly being associated with these people, which Nixon chose to do, he was impeached. This justifies the claim that people's lives are a result of their actions because Nixon chose to be with unsavory characters and participate in their scandal. As a result, he was impeached from his office as President because of the choices he made.\nA third example is seen in Milton's \"Paradise Lost.\" In this epic poem, Satan chooses to rebel against God. As a consequence, Satan and his demons, including Beezlebub, Mammon, Belial, and Moloch, are damned to suffer in hell, not only physically, but also emotionally. Because Satan actually chose to fight God, he was forced to suffer the consequences. This justifies the claim that people's lives are a result of the choices they make because Satan's decision, made of his free will, led him to suffer the punishment of his actions. Milton's epic serves as an example to mankind about resisting evil in the world because the consequences are horrendus.\nIn conclusion, people make decisions and either reap its benefits or suffer its consequences. As seen in Shakespeare, Watergate, and Milton, people's lives are a result of their choices. As it has been proven, what goes around will always come around.

I'd likely have been able to graduate after this semester, b/c I could've afforded room/board the past two summers. Anyway, this is about my (relatively pretty recent) GPA frustrations.\n\nI've worked hard to keep my GPA above a 3.0 since freshman year; every semester (or quarter) since, I've been able to get b/w cumulative 3.2's and 3.3's (excluding the summer before I transferred and took summer gen-chem II as a non-matric, and then came into the fall with around a 2.7 :P) I started out undeclared as a bio major at first, didn't declare anything until beginning of Spring'11 (last year), IIRC -- but as a Psych BS. I mean I already had most of the Natural Science req's done...and I'm looking at the more bio-psych areas of psych so makes sense, right? Bio courses were mostly what always kept my GPA down...I think the fact that last spring, the first term in college that I didn't take any biology courses, I got a 3.45 semester GPA -- my highest in my college career, makes that pretty apparent. :P\n\nSo usually having one fiasco of a semester in your college career is mostly okay, right? ...Yeah, I guess usually when that happens, it's people who goofed off their freshman year or something....not a senior who was a victim of confounding circumstance* (seriously, you don't even have to actually read the crap after the \"*\" at the end of this post, to just presume from its lengthiness what I'm saying here... haha. but for fun or whatever it's all there anyway! lmao) that led to like a 1.4-something semester GPA, bringing the cumulative down to a 2.63, and now only has 3 more semesters to get it back up to at least a 3.0. >:/\n\nSee what annoys me also is the fact that you are really limited, at least at my school, once you drop below a 3.0...can't live in the upperclassman/graduate apartments, the research experience I pretty much am obligated to have if I expect to be accepted into any grad school, is much harder to find -- it was already hard enough when I had to eliminate every professor or program that requires at least an overall 3.5!! And there's still the issue of being very limited with summer courses, only to those that are offered at a campus near me locally, which is about 10% of what's offered on-campus...\n\nSo I feel like now not only did I do all that work in vain (which I feel is maybe double what a lot of BA majors in social sciences have done... I'm not trying to be condescending, but when I talk to a lot of them I realize how many hard courses I've taken, that have kept my GPA <3.5, and also how much extra work they are, and it just is kinda irritating. But I'm told a BS with a 3.2 \"looks better\" to grad schools than a BA with like a 3.9...) --but also, that I nearly (if not completely) blew my chances of going to grad school, at least directly, unless I end up taking SIX years to get a Bachelor's.\n\nMaybe I'm doing the math wrong (funny because CalcI is one of the only 3 courses I've gotten a full A in in all of college so far!! hahaha) but I've already calculated it manually according to instructions on websites, as well as typed my grades into several websites, and it just seems soooooo friggin unfair to me, that everyone who goofed off their entire freshman year while I worked my skin to the bone trying to keep >3.0, had the chance to do just that, while I screw up right on time to annihilate my college career and possibly my career in general... I mean am I missing something here?? Is there some trick I don't know about or some way that uni's tend to \"excuse\" things like this, and I was never made aware because it wasn't ever a problem I needed to address? haha.\n\nSo, anyone who has gotten this far in my incessant (and maybe pointless) rant -- advice?? Am I the first person to have their crappy semester as an upperclassman and not a freshman?? And what about all this research stuff? The irony of it is I have what I've coined \"senior year itch\" -- kinda like \"senioritis\" but for aspiring grad students... I've just mentally given up on requirements and cant get my heart into it, and so I tend to do better with upper division psych electives than anything; I also often tend to \"waste time\" online reading journal articles and academic literature instead of doing coursework! LOL so it's like I've already transitioned into a grad school mindset and cant get myself to do this menial (at least that's what it seems like to me) coursework; especially when I'm so tired of not having a job (or struggling to find one since transferring), and kinda just wanna be done with the taking-courses-courses-and-more-courses-then-exams-and-exams-and-more-exams lifestyle that I now have another year of than most undergrads as it is....\n\n*NOTE: I've been taking medication for ADHD, though I'm not sure if that's really what I have, or if it's just some sort of sleep cycle issue, or burnout from chronic stress and poor adrenal function or something...or \"poopout\" from chronic antidepressant use for anxiety that has left me apathetic and lethargic..or a combination of the latter two..? haha. But anyway, I've been using it mostly to get me out of bed in the morning, as I've had to take morning classes that only had one section offered... if I'm not mistaken, every semester thus far since transferring. At one point my dose was reduced (which I feel is my fault in a way for telling my doctor the initial dose sounded too high...), like in October, and I was sleeping through most of my classes for a few weeks, or maybe half of them, at least. At the end of Sept. I spilled a drink on my keyboard (mind you that is the first time that has happened to me in the 4 years I've had this laptop!!) and for about the next whole week I had no functional computer, and had to keep messing with the BIOS and restarting and trying to work on a machine that had a keyboard with a mind of its own most of the time.... at times like midnight...4am...8am...to get assignments done. Then I buy a replacement wireless keyboard/mouse when I finally have the money that I told my parents I need (did I mention I was broke?) and the weekend before Halloween (the day another assignment was due, btw) I was trying to get my laptop to be partitioned properly for once since I got it... it strangely came with a 30g logical drive out of 160g total, and ever since it's ended up divided into multiple arbitrary partitions, lol I just wanted a normal machine!!!\n\nI figure that since I don't have a flash drive or external HDD that I was willing to reformat and lose everything that is on them, I don't really have a way of backing up my stuff, and since the software I was using was rated so highly in reviews, I figured there isn't much of a chance that I'd lose everything... well maybe the program is okay, but my computer decided to freeze while working on \"operation 4 of 8\", which happened to be my C drive!! >:/ So 12 hours later, on a Sunday, it was still stuck there, and even though it says to not power off your machine, I had an assignment due and felt I had no choice.... I power it back on and it basically tells me I have no OS installed. :O So I took the following week to try to find free software (since I'm poor and all) to recover my lost stuff... well that took awhile, and then when I finally got it working, it was acting kinda slow and weird but I figured that's Vista being Vista... haha. Anyway so a week after THAT -- which was Thanksgiving break -- it crashed randomly! Again!! On a Saturday night, before an assignment due on a Monday morning!! AGAIN!\n\nAnd then a week and a half after that I woke up at 6am with severe flank pain, went to the ER that weekend and found out I had a kidney infection, was told to take at least the following week off which happened to be the last week of classes....\n\nHad to take I's and then arrange with all my instructors to get them changed to grades. Got a call from Client Support on campus, whom I brought my laptop to a few days before the kidney pain issue, that my hard drive \"appears to be malfunctioning\" and I needed to replace it... oh that's nice, lol. Anyways, there was this one class I found ridiculously unreasonably demanding or a 100-level course (-- not the material in itself, but dumb rules like \"you must bring a printed copy of all assignments to class, online submissions are not graded\" -- that was a first for me; and also there were like several assignments due per week, maybe as many as 6 separate ones....which is logistically, IMHO, unreasonable for a typical college schedule! I'd rather hae huge assignments due every other week (barring perfectly timed computer crashes)!  It was for one of the requirements I needed and I was intending at first to go to the student health clinic and find out *** was wrong with me because doesn't this seem like something that would impair my academic functioning? lol. But then since I kept sleeping so much all the time, I'd miss appointments that *I* scheduled, to get to the bottom of why I sleep so much!! LOL. Anyway, long story short I got an F in that class...\n\nForgot to mention that the course that my laptop was not allowing me to complete assignments for, was an upper-division one for my major.. a psych research methods one, and the papers we had to write were hypothetical, but when the rough draft of our results section was due.. well, 5 days before it was due, whomever is in charge of this course decided that we now have to use actual numerical values in our results sections (even though the \"studies\" are entirely hypothetical), and these actual numerical values had to make actual contextual sense. ARE YOU KIDDING ME??\n\nUltimately that also screwed me over, because I was so preoccupied and concerned over that section... \"is this a reasonable number for an ANOVA?\" \"Am I even using the right ANOVA?\" \"Do I get points off if I use APA 6th edition instead of 5th to cite this data?\" \"IF 5th was shown in class and I use 6th, then won't I get points off for 6th instead?\"\n\nOur TA also told us after that whole \"you need to use real numbers now\" deal, that we can still just draw graphs in MS Paint... how can you use \"real\" data, and appropriately APA-formatted graphs, by drawing crap in MS Paint?\n\nSo instead, I figured it's not worth the risk and I'd just do it the \"long way\", and make a \"Real\" graph to not risk losing points.....\n\nOh yeah, but most stats software requires RAW DATA INPUT in order to provide OUTPUT. oops. Still didn't want to use Paint though... so I started making up random numerical values/finding number generators.\n\nAnyway this crap just went on and on, into this semester, and I ended up not turning the paper in the first week like I arranged with the prof. after my kidneys decided to stop working... I kinda just froze up, which I tend to do under a certain amt. of stress, and a week later, I was still avoided my email inbox because I was dreading getting one asking for my paper... anyway, I think it was the week of Valentine's Day that I finally got myself to read my email (because avoiding it was causing other issues with communication w/ everyone else :P) and saw something dated the 6th saying I didnt reply by then and so \"forfeited\" my chances of completing the paper.. afterwards I saw one dated 1/31 that mentioned all that... so yeah, ended up with 2 F's, one in a 4-credit course...\n\nAlso, I feel kind of like my body has done me great injustice, as I noticed that after the infection cleared, I wasn't getting kidney/flank pains I'd been getting since September (which I assumed were related to my increased coffee intake or something...lol) and I've heard that upper UTI's (i.e. kidneys, mainly) can go unnoticed/asymptomatic for a long time before you find out or suspect anything's wrong. Makes me wonder if I just had an infection the entirety of last semester and that was messing with my sleep/energy even more than the mess it usually is.... I also lost a lot of weight (well, about 10 pounds, but w/ my BMI that put me into \"underweight\" range on the BMI scale, lol) even though I felt like I was always eating, and perhaps expending as much energy going places to obtain food, as I was taking in eating..\n\nSo I'm not sure I can \"undo\" these F's in any way retroactively by somehow proving my entire semester was screwed around with by my body and my PC (which I was afraid to mention because it kept happening on weekends before Mon. AM due dates, and I already felt really lame having to ask to be excused twice for not submitting stuff, before the HD crash ordeal even began....)

This is my first Sparknote book essay so I'm curious to see my score. Please be honest.\n\nTo prevent possible copyright, I'll only write question which is reworded:\n\nQ: Do you think that a wealthier nation should always provide aid to a poorer country? Pick your position and support with evidences from your reading, experiences, or observations.\n\nMy essay:\n\nDo wealthy nations' aids really help the poor nations? Or do they instaed make situations more critical? Although most wealthy nations aid other nations in good purpose, the result is not always positive. In my opinion, wealthy nations should not always provide aid because of possible consequences.\n\nFirst, Japan served as a good example for how aids were not always good. After World War II, United States set up democracy government in Japan and helped to rebuild its nation. Under General McArthur's command, Japan recovered enormously and became an elite nation with many adroit workers. But to United States, this resulted a negative consequence since they now have very large amount of debts on Japan. clearly, this \"aid\" actually hurt the wealthy United States.\n\nSecond, another nice example was my friend who had a private tutor. Although I didn't know his academic abilities, I knew that he was a smart person. But his parents put him with one-on-one tutor because they didn't think his grades would be good enough. As a result, he was forced to study with tutor intensely for several weeks. I later learned that his grades did improve but they soon dropped when his parents stopped using the tutor. In another word, his parents artificially inflated his scores because they thought he needed them. In reality, he didn't.\n\nThird, Native Indians was a very important examples for this issue. Similar to how wealthy nations helped poor nations with sympathy, European and American settlers tried to help Native Americans by convicing them to be Christian. However, these people\n\nEuropean and and American settlers\n\ndidn't realize that their adis were actually destroying Native Americans' cultures. Moreover, Nations Americans never asked for their help. So, it appeared clearly that those \"aids\" served as subtle forms of weapons to destroy Native Americans.\n\nUnquestionably, wealthy nations' aids may not be good things. Without knowing how poor nations felt, those aids were completely unnecessary. The wealthy nations therefore should not always aid other nations.\n\nThanks!

If anyone has the time/desire to read it I'd greatly appreciate it!\n\nPS- I mentioned CC in it! I said \"it has become an entire online community devoted to the hysteria of college admissions.\"---too true ;)\n\n\nHysteria and Elite College Admissions: A Cultural Phenomenon\n\nEach fall, the twelfth-graders of the United States go through the western equivalent of the Maasai circumcision rite. Although significantly less physically painful, this American coming-of-age rite is often more emotionally taxing. Often seen as the culmination and measure of one\u2019s adolescent life, it is no wonder that it leads to disillusionment and disappointment. Even though the foundations of this coming of age ceremony are older than the foundations of the American government itself, it is still often regarded with a sense of mystery and surrounded by hysteria. What is this mysterious trial, this sacrosanct path to adulthood? The answer might surprise you- college admissions.\n\nAlthough college is not the path chosen by all high school seniors, on a national whole, it is the most popular.   Out of the majority of graduating seniors planning on attending college, it is a stressful time for comparatively few. Less than twenty-five percent of US colleges take less than fifty percent of applicants and over seventy five percent of students get into their top choice school.  Granted, application essays and fees are universally hated, but the real stress is on students applying to the increasingly-selective top universities. For the top ten percent or so of American students, the college admissions game is difficult, and continued to get increasingly harder.\n\n\nWhat is an Elite College?\n\nIn order for us to understand the hysteria revolving around elite college admissions, we must first examine what constitutes an \u201celite\u201d college. There are over 4,000 two and four year, public and private, colleges and universities in the United States .  Most would only consider the top 40 or so of these \u201celite\u201d colleges. Often, what makes these colleges \u201celite\u201d in the eyes of applicants and the general populace, has very little to do with teaching or educational quality. At many of these \u201celite\u201d colleges, undergraduates take a second seat to graduate students and professional research while at smaller schools (though considered less \u201celite\u201d) the undergraduate would receive a much more personal and fulfilling education.  The most important factors in the public eye in determining an \u201celite\u201d college is its prestige and media exposure.\n\nThe concept of prestige is very complicated itself. The primary factor in prestige is a college\u2019s history. As counter productive as it may seem in our day and age of rapid progress and change, many in the United States associate age with quality. The more history behind a brand name, the more experience a politician has, the better it or he is considered. Consequently, Harvard, the oldest university in the United States, is perceived as one of the best, if not the best, university in the United States. Closely related to this that many \u201cold money\u201d, blue blood families have legacy ties to colonial colleges and therefore many prestigious, old colleges have a history of producing wealthy alumni with powerful ties. In fact, nineteen of the forty three (44%) US presidents studied at one of the nine schools chartered in colonial times (Harvard University, Yale University, Princeton University, University of Pennsylvania, Columbia University, Brown University, Dartmouth College, William & Mary and Rutgers University)  at some point in their lives . It is no coincidence that the schools on this list of nine are considered among the most prestigious.\n\nAlong with the prestige, media coverage plays an important role in public perception of colleges. Since many older, prestigious schools produce newsworthy alumni (and indeed children and grandchildren of newsworthy alumni), they naturally they receive media attention. However, a large and newsworthy alumni base is not the only way colleges receive media attention. Collegiate sports are a multi-billion dollar business in the United States and many schools not only benefit from this financially, they benefit from the increased public notoriety and perception of the school as and elite university. Indeed, the most famous group of prestigious colleges, the Ivy League (whose name has become synonymous with elite colleges) started off as an athletic league. Another role the media plays in public perception of colleges is the publishing of rankings. Rankings, such as the US News and World Report \u201cBest College Rankings\u201d, inherently flawed as they may be (taking into account easily manipulated or sometimes ridiculous criteria, such as \u201calumni giving rate\u201d, into their methodology) are the only contact many out side of the ivory tower have with higher education and are treated as gospel by some. The same Universities are perpetually ranked at the top and thus are perpetually perceived as the most desirable because the media says so.\n\n\nWhat is the Hysteria?\n\nMany top applicants to US universities have a \u201cdo or die\u201d attitude about college admissions. Some students- and parents- will stop at nothing to make sure they get into the most prestigious university possible. Students will invest countless dollars and hours into getting in to the \u201cbest\u201d university. The admissions and test-prep industries are multi-billion dollar industries, with students and their parents all too willing to pay for anything that will help them get into top universities.\n\nOne of the most obvious examples of this spending culture is the hiring of private college counselors. There is a long-standing belief that connections are the key to elite college admissions and some will pay dearly for insider advice and connections. The internet revolution has made it easier than ever for students with the wish, and means, for private counseling to find an agency. A simple Google search returned dozens of internet based college counseling businesses offering everything from an evaluation of your \u2018chances\u2019 for admissions at schools ($89), to admissions essay help and editing ($250), to the exorbitant \u201cIvy Guaranteed Acceptance Program\u201d ($15,000).  The latter program, the \u201cIvy Guaranteed Acceptance Program\u201d, which guarantees acceptance to any college or university- or your money back, is a prime example of how out of control admissions have become. In order to be eligible for participation in the \u201cIGAP\u201d program, you must first pass a preliminary screening to see if you have the credentials for the Ivy League. It is only then that the company will take your 15,000 dollars. In short, this means that they will only accept students into the program that they believe will be accepted into the Ivy League regardless of their services, essentially safeguarding their time investment. But, students and their parents still continue to pay for help they don\u2019t need just for the assurance that they will end up at an \u201celite college\u201d.\n\nWhile extensive private college counseling obviously caters towards a specific (very wealthy) clientele, testing and test prep is a universal bane. Often required, and always hated, the SAT admissions test has been around since 1901. The SAT is a four hour multiple choice exam testing in critical reading, mathematics and writing. However, this extensive test is only one of the many standardized tests that are often required at elite universities. Many applicants to elite universities also take SAT subject tests (tests in one specific academic discipline) and/or the ACT (yet another standardized admissions exam). While some would consider it hysterical just to sit for a four hour exam, for many highly motivated students, the time spent on the exam is just the tip of the iceberg. Countless hours- and again, dollars- are spent on test prep.   For the majority of students, test prep consists of a book and good, old-fashioned hard work. But again a select few have the resources to afford a $3399 private SAT prep course . Even yet, once is not enough for some students. The masochists and perfectionists have taken it to the next level. Many students take and prep for admissions exams more than once to try for that perfect score.\n\nTesting is but only one front of the admissions war. Many applicants also try to boost their records on the home front. Sadly, some of the methods used are quite outside of the rules of gentlemanly conduct. Cheating has become rampant in high schools across the country. Sharing answers on tests and plagiarism, once again facilitated by modern technology, especially cell phones, is all too commonplace. In addition to cheating at school, some students applying to selective universities will even lie on their applications. They will elaborate or even fabricate their extra-curricular involvement. Likewise, many students will become \u201cserial joiners\u201d their senior year and join numerous unrelated clubs and sports to try to improve their application. Some students will undermine their morals, cheating and lying their way into Harvard, and some will waste time at chess, science, tech, literature, and drama clubs just to make themselves appear to be a better applicant.\n\nFinally, hysteria is present in the actual application process. Or should I say processes. Thirty, even twenty years ago, most students applied to three, maybe four schools. Most college counselors and those in the industry still recommend applying to three schools-safety schools that is- along with three match schools and three reach schools, which brings the total to nine schools. But even though good spread of nine schools is now standard, we still have students applying to ten-plus schools. According to one internet study 37 percent of students applied to ten or more schools.  In hopes of bettering their odds, students cast the net wider. Ironically, this lowers the acceptance rate at schools. When people apply to too many schools, there are more applicants per spot and thus more rejections. The elite college applicant community has thus adopted a highly maladaptive process and pushed themselves into a state of precarious negative equilibrium. All would be better off if they only applied to schools they seriously liked, and refrained from applying to schools merely to \u201cbetter their odds\u201d in their eyes.\n\nWhy is there the Hysteria?\n\nFor us to evaluate the cause for this hysteria, we need to revisit the Maasai boy on his journey to manhood. What makes the western rite of college admissions so different? Why is there the hysteria?\n\nThe first cause of the hysteria is choice. Above almost all else choice is valued in western culture. Not so among the Maasai and other cultures. Essentially, the Maasai youth had the decision made for him- to refuse circumcision would result in him being expelled from the tribe. In western culture, youth have many, many more choices. They can choose to go to college or enter the workforce. If they choose to attend college they have another choice. Actually make that about 4,000 other choices. The process of narrowing choices can be quite overwhelming for students. Thus, since a choice isn\u2019t made for them directly, then turn to what society deems as an appropriate standard. What society views as a good school -often regional universities close to the applicants home or national \u201celite\u201d colleges, rarely a school with out local name recognition- is taken as a proxy. Therefore, many qualified students are applying to the same schools with name recognition and prestige and driving acceptance down and hysteria up.\n\nAnother factor in the hysteria is the advent of the technology age. The internet has revolutionized the application process to universities and colleges. The Common Application, which is accepted at 321 institutions of higher learning, makes it easier than ever for students to roll the dice and test their odds. One click of a mouse and your application is off to Harvard and twelve other schools, further inflating application numbers and driving down acceptances. Also, the internet has led to the rise of a \u201ccollege admissions culture\u201d. Many websites cater to the student applying to college; indeed, in our information age a student need never leave his computer to gain knowledge of a school. Collegeconfidential.com, a discussion forum, takes it even further. Here people devote countless hours to researching schools, asking people to evaluate their chances and asking college admissions questions. Geared mostly toward the high-achieving ambitious student, it has become an entire online community devoted to the hysteria of college admissions.\n\nThe mystery and uncertainty of admissions also plays an important role in the hysteria. The Maasai boy knows exactly what is going to happen to him and what the result will be. He will participate in a ceremony, undergo a painful surgery, and then will rise and be accepted as a full warrior and man of his tribe, with all the responsibilities and rights of a thirty year old.  The college applicant knows not what to expect. He puts in his applications and waits to hear what the sum total of his life so far has been. In addition, even though the first college of the colonies predates the creation of our government, there is still an element of mystery in the acceptance processes of selective universities. No amount of perfect scores can get you in to anywhere- many elite universities reject valedictorians with perfect standardized tests. When universities have eight times as many academically qualified applicants as they have spots, the emphasis is places on intangible qualities, essays and other unquantifiables. The process has become arbitrary and along with the uncertainty of what the results will be it is no wonder the process leads to hysteria.\n\nWe finally come to the foremost reasons for the hysteria and biggest difference between western culture and Maasai culture- material wealth, power over others and prestige. In Maasai culture, there are two ranks in life for males: boy and man. Boy can only become man through waiting and a set of prescribed rituals. Essentially, the Maasai are an egalitarian culture with little difference in wealth, power and prestige among adults. There is no desire or need for anything more than what one already has. Contrast this to western culture. In western culture, there is no clear dichotomy between stations of life. There are no rituals to facilitate movement from one level of society to another and there is most defiantly a desire for what one doesn\u2019t have. The multitude of professions and positions, and lack of organized rituals and boundaries between them means that in life only way to improve ones status in life and material possessions is to work for it. Unfortunately, many see college as a shortcut to wealth, power and prestige. Certainly, some diplomas carry more prestige than others, employers often prefer graduates from certain schools and many powerful people went to the same group of schools, but is that what an education is about? Too many people have the mentality that if they try their best, stop at nothing and get into an \u201celite university\u201d that they will be set for life. Until this mentality that a college degree from a certain school being a shortcut to success is eradicated, the hysteria will persist. Until an education is seen as an education, not an express ticket to wealth, power and prestige, students will still pay $15,000 to be guaranteed their acceptance, will still take the SAT five times, and will still lie and cheat to get their shot at the \u201cgood life\u201d.

When this happens, as IB courses are two-year courses, the exam results only come out during the summer of a student's senior year (basically when they graduate). This means the colleges won't see the actual scores in the student's applications.\nOn the other hand, the actual AP test scores can be given in the applications if the applicant takes the test before their senior year.\nSince the IB scores cannot be given to the colleges, the schools which the applicant attends usually only give the colleges \"predicted exam scores\" for the applicant.\nBecause of this difference that colleges can know the AP test results but not the IB exam results, is there a disadvantage for applicants who take the IB program?

He loves the logical paradoxes that result from time travel and I would like to present one such scenario. The point of the thread is not to prove anything but is an interesting thought exercise.\n\nImagine for a moment that a man wants to kill a person who was responsible for the death of his father. However, he wants to kill the person before they get a chance to kill the father and thus change history. He builds a time machine and steals a samurai sword from his local museum. He leaves what is his present on 4th January 2008 and travels back to 6th August 2007. The journey results in his time machine completely breaking down and unfortunately he is killed by his father's killers in the attempt of killing them. The killers, in order to appear benevolent and rid themselves of the evidence, donate the sword (that appears very rare) to the local museum. This is the sword that is later stolen by the time traveler in an attempt to kill his father's murderers.\n\nThis results in what is called an ontological paradox. The sword has a beginning and an end in real time history. It arrives into history on 6th August 2007 when it is brought back from the future by the time traveler. It leaves history when it leaves 4th January 2008 to go back in time. Consequently, prior to 6th August 2007 it doesn't exist and after 4th January 2008 it doesn't exist. However, it is impossible that the sword was ever designed or created in anyway.\n\nWhilst it appears that classical objects cannot exist in such paradoxical states it got me thinking about quantum states that do appear capable of such feats (called quantum superpositions). If the appearance of a particle was actually a particle coming from the future and the disappearance of the particle (some time after) was actually the particle slipping back through time then the particle would appear to have a beginning and end in real time yet it would be logically impossible for the particle to have been created.\n\nThoughts?

I was also apart of CJSF. However, I'm unsure of how many semesters I actually have counted.\n\nAlso, I have been in NHS since the second semester of my sophomore year (the earliest you can be), and have all the active hours for it.\n\nOther than that, I've been kind of scattered in the club area but I am hopefully starting something at my school this year to bring students together and to break down walls, so maybe that will make up for it\n\nExtracurricular Activities:\nI'm very involved in church. I have been the head usher for the teen Mass for 2 or 3 years now, volunteer at every event, was part of the high school youth group for almost 3 years, and most importantly, will be starting my 3rd year as being a counselor for the middle school youth group, where I also am the most frequent, active, helpful member and will surely get an amazing letter of recommendation from my youth minister. As a result of being a leader there, I am a great oral speaker and know how to connect with others much better now. I think I must have over 200 hours of community service from it.\n\nI am worried, though, because honestly, that's all I've got. :/ I mean I also have tutored like half my school but I never keep track of when I do it so that will only be visible in my letters of recommendation from my teachers.\n\nFamily History:\nMy parents split when I was about 2, and my dad moved from Northern California to Southern California shortly after. Because of a stupid custody ruling, I switched between the two, 500 miles apart, every year(I spent 1st grade with my dad, then 2nd grade with my mom, then 3rd grade with my dad, etc) until 6th grade, when it was ruled that I would do middle school with my mom, and then high school with my dad. I came of age to decide my own placement within middle school and decided to stay with my mom for high school. Even with some sort of stability, I didn't make any real friends until sophomore and junior year, which is partly why my freshman grades were crappy.\n\nIn addition, neither my father, mother, nor step-father have college degrees, nor do any of my grandparents.\n\nMisc. Info:\nI can write clear, concise, emotionally moving, and intellectually stimulating essays to convey who I am and the process of becoming that person.....if that counts at all haha\n\nLastly, next year I am taking 6 AP classes(Stats, Calc BC, Physics, Lit, Spanish, Econ) and will be doing Senior Mentoring(Seniors help Freshman sort of deal)\n\nSoooooo, how's it looking for UCLA? haha :) "}, {"date": "2011-12-02T14:38:55+00:00", "url": "http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/graduate-school/1251501-research-quality-vs-quantity.html", "messages": "\n                    Hi everyone. I'm a junior in Oregon State's Biological and Ecological Engineering program (BEE for short). I've got another year or two before I will be applying to graduate school, and I'm curious which will be more beneficial during the application process: having research experience in the engineering department itself, but with little to no meaningful contribution/participation, or having research experience in a lab that is not a part of the college of engineering, but with a high level of meaningful contribution/participation.\n\nHere is my current situation:\n\nI've been working as a research assistant (~15 - 20 hrs/wk) in a molecular biology lab for the past 1.5 years. About a year ago, I became involved in a project with one of our postdocs. We worked closely together for several months before he received a job offer across the country and moved away. I at that point essentially 'inherited' the project. Since then, I have been continuing the project semi-independently, guided only by my weekly meetings with the lab's PI. (E.g., I am expected to do my own reading/research on the subject, analyze my own results, determine from there how to proceed next, etc. It's no longer a situation where I come into work, receive a to-do list, do it, and then leave the results for my superiors to think over. The PI and I meet regularly to discuss the project's progress, and, using my latest findings, determine how to proceed.) The results I've generated thus far have already been incorporated into a coauthored paper, and should I continue my work here, there will be opportunities to contribute meaningfully to additional publications.\n\nHowever, this lab is not in the engineering department, and thus not an 'engineering' lab. (Though to be perfectly honest, I'm not even sure what would even differentiate a regular biology lab from a biological engineering lab.) However, because a good chunk of the scope of the BEE program has a molecular/genomic focus, essentially all of the BEE labs that are actually pertinent to my interests conduct research that is fundamentally the same as my current research.\n\nWhat I'm unsure about is whether this lack of 'engineering' in the title is going to be detrimental for me when applying for graduate engineering programs in the future. Also, more broadly, is it generally more desirable for an applicant to have several, less involved/meaningful research experiences, or only one experience that is very involved/meaningful? It would seem to me that having the single, more involved experience would be preferable, if only because it would suggest a higher degree of dedication to the research, and that the PI apparently felt you were competent enough to keep you around and assign you to projects of importance.\n\nAny thoughts or input on this would be greatly appreciated. I will also be discussing this with my academic advisor the next time we meet, but the more perspectives I can get, the better. Also, if it makes any difference: obtaining the required number of LOR's would not be an issue if I were to stay at my current lab---in addition to a sparkling recommendation from the PI, there are a handful of professors in my actual program of study that know me well enough to provide good LOR's as well.\n\nThanks in advance!

Some of you may have seen it before:\n\nhttp://talk.collegeconfidential.com/new-york-university/717704-my-1st-year-pre-med-nyu-detailed-information-prospective-pre-meds.html\n\nAnyway, I just graduated last December after 3 & 1/2 years in CAS. Right now I have some time to kill, so I thought I would provide some additional info about the later pre-med courses at NYU. I remember when I was a senior in high school who had no idea about what was in store for me academically once I arrived here. It is my hope that this information will help people down the road who are in a similar position that I was in and allow those of you in the coming years to know ahead of time what to expect and to prepare for each situation as you see fit. I know that this will only appeal to a select group of students, so I apologize for the fact that I can\u0092t answer every single question about NYU in general. I will also apologize ahead of time if anything is missing, unclear, disorganized, excessively long, or needlessly descriptive; to be honest, my writing skills have not improved much since high school (not that it's very important as a science major lol). Seriously though, keep in mind that my academic experiences are limited to pre-med and a specific subset of the biology track but if there's something relevant that I might have left out, feel free to ask and I'll do my best to answer it. I\u0092ll also try to keep this shorter than the last thread, partly because I don\u0092t want to have to write the most horribly written story ever, and partly because I don\u0092t remember a whole lot of specific details from sophomore or junior year.\n\n\nSo, to begin: I\u0092ve already gone over the courses that the majority of 1st year pre-meds take in the thread that I linked to above. I\u0092m just going to highlight a few relatively inconsequential changes (From what I know, most of it still applies today but if anyone has updates, feel free to correct me). \u0093Conversations of the West\u0094 is now \u0093Texts and Ideas\u0094, and \u0093World Cultures is now Cultures & Contexts\u0094. The courses are taught in a similar manner, with Texts and Ideas being more philosophically inclined and Cultures & Contexts being more historical in nature. In addition, the labs for General Chemistry have merged with the lectures so the same professor is now responsible for the entire General Chemistry curriculum, as opposed to one professor doing the lectures and another overseeing lab when I was a freshman (From what I know, the labs and lectures are still running in a similar manner, so I don\u0092t think that this changed anything significantly).\n\n\nNow, onto the new information. After freshman year (Just for reference, based on my own VERY rough estimates after looking at the number of students in Organic Chemistry, comparing it to General Chemistry, and finally taking into account the proportion of students who decided to take Organic and General Chemistry a year later), I would say that at least 1/3 of all freshmen who were pre-meds had given up after Principles of Biology and General Chemistry.\n\nDespite the seemingly grim statistic that I just estimated, I would say that sophomore year at NYU is, for the majority of the \u0093serious\u0094 pre-meds here, the defining year, the year that they take a long hard look at their progress and decide whether or not they are cut out for the pre-med track. An even larger percentage of students decide to discontinue pre-med by the end of this year. For most, sophomore year is probably one of the most academically challenging years out of all 4 (although this may depend on your major). As a Biology major, sophomore year was (in my opinion) the worst out of all 4 years. My GPA took a decent hit, partly due to the workload in science courses, and partly due to the fact that I made very poor choices in terms of my Conversations of the West and English courses (pre-meds are required to take a second semester of English in order to satisfy the one year English requirement; Writing the Essay counts for the first semester). In general, most pre-meds who are not Biology majors take both General Physics and Organic Chemistry in their sophomore year, both of which are one year, two semester courses. Biology majors generally only take Organic Chemistry because we also have to take Molecular & Cell Biology, which was arguably the most challenging Biology course that I took at NYU. The professor has changed since then (I believe the current one is Stephen Small, who was also my departmental advisor for a period of time) and I believe it is a bit more bearable now since Small is actually reasonable (My professor refused to allow recording devices/electronics, did not post lecture notes online, and during lecture gave us an average of 20-30 seconds per slide, half of which only contained figures without any descriptions). Nevertheless, the course is exceedingly difficult, and I think the use of a graduate-level textbook is quite fitting. Regarding my other course choices, I chose Intro to Archaeology in order to satisfy my Social Sciences MAP requirement (Interesting course and relatively easy as long as you\u0092re good at memorizing places and dates), Conversations of the West: Animal Humans, Medical Anthropology, and 19th Century English Novel. I recommend taking Medical Anthropology at some point as an elective if you have the space for it in your schedule. The course load is relatively light and I learned about the cultural interactions involved in how medicine is viewed and practiced around the world, a consideration that I believe is severely lacking in the practice of Western medicine. If Animal Humans or some variation of it is still offered as a Texts & Ideas course, don\u0092t take it unless you\u0092re extremely interested in debating philosophy. For the record, the main idea at the end is that we\u0092re similar to animals in some ways and distinctly different in others, but there are still some questions about our relationship that are difficult to answer (which is something that a high-functioning child in primary school can tell you for free). Also, do not take 19th Century English Novel unless you are genuinely interested in 19th Century English Novels AND you want to compete with a room that is 95% English majors for that A (No offense to English or philosophy majors, I admit that I am just personally very bad at those two subjects, and I\u0092m sure that some people reading this that are majoring in the sciences would like to take easier courses in those subject areas). For what it\u0092s worth, I heard later on that Asian-American literature is a relatively easy English course that a lot of pre-meds take, but its appeal might be limited to those who are interested in Asian-American culture.\n\n\nHowever, I\u0092m sure that most of you don\u0092t care about my MAP course choices, electives, or my Biology major-specific courses; not everyone will take those. Every pre-med will, though, end up taking Organic Chemistry, and I think it\u0092s appropriate that I give it its own section. Maitland Jones Jr., a hot shot Organic chemist that formerly taught at Princeton, is the primary professor for this course. Depending on who you are and how much you interact with him, you will have very different opinions about him as a person, so I\u0092m going to leave that up to you to decide whether or not you like his real personality. I\u0092m only going to cover the important academic aspects of the course. The first thing he tells you on the first day of class is that there is no curve, so there is no competition between the students. THIS IS A LIE. Assuming that the grading system has not changed, a 65 raw score is approximately the B/B- divide, which sounds very reasonable. He claims that this is the historic average and theoretically, if everyone can score in the mid 80s on every exam, everyone will get an A. What he fails to tell you (and what some of you have probably deduced by now) is that his goal is to ALWAYS make the final grade average out to be as close to 65 as possible. Since he writes the tests, all he has to do is generate exams based on how the class is performing. If the average for one exam is extremely high, he will make the next test ridiculously difficult in order to get his 65 average. Sometimes he is horrible at doing this and ridiculous things happen. In the first semester of fall 2009, the average for our first 3 exams was approximately a 70, which to him was too high. He made an extremely difficult final exam, far more difficult than the one that he gave in 2008. According to my TA, the average for the final exam was somewhere in the low to mid 40s. Since the final was worth approximately 30% of our grade, this brought the final grade average down to around a 64 \u0096 65. In my spring semester, the average grade on 2 out of the 3 midterm exams was atrocious, somewhere in the 50-55 range. As a result, he made the final ridiculously easy by asking you to write just the basic sample reactions that are literally written in his textbook. The average for that final was somewhere around 80.\n\nSo why am I telling you all of this? The reason is that I don\u0092t want anyone to believe his lies when he says that there is no curve and no competition. Due to the way that he manipulates his exams, your grade will be determined by how well you do relative to your classmates, which is more or less how a curve functions. If you are inherently good at Orgo like a handful of the students are every year, then this won\u0092t apply to you; there are a number of students who can consistently obtain raw scores of 90 and above. However, the vast majority of students will be scoring lower than that on most exams. I\u0092m not advocating that you should try to actively sabotage your classmates, but you should be very aware of the amount of work that you need to do in order to stay above the average. The majority of the questions will be synthesis-related and the entire exam is written. In order to understand how these types of problems work, you need to understand how to do the problems at the end of each chapter. It\u0092s a considerable amount of work, but the fact is that the reading in the textbook only tells you the basic mechanisms that you need to know. You\u0092re responsible for figuring out how they can be used in a variety of situations in order to generate specific products, and it is only through practice that you\u0092ll learn to think like an organic chemist.\n\nThe lab component of Organic Chemistry is pretty abysmal and very similar to General Chemistry Lab. However, it can be bearable if you luck out and get a good TA. The majority of the TAs consist grad students that recently came from China and their English is very poor. Most of the time they huddle together in groups next to a counter or bench and talk to each other in Chinese. I even overheard several of them on numerous occasions asking each other in Chinese what the lab was about, and these were the people who were supposed to help us and answer our questions regarding that day\u0092s lab (For the record, I am ethnically Chinese as well, so please do not misconstrue any of this as me being racist). I really don\u0092t understand why the grad school chemistry program forces these individuals to TA when they are clearly not qualified for the job. Some tips for doing well in the class: Always read the labs thoroughly beforehand and plan ahead as much as possible in order to minimize the chances of error; most of the experiments are not salvageable and you will need to repeat the experiment from the start should you fail at any step. Failure to generate the final product will usually cause you to lose points unless your TA is extra generous. In addition, always have either you or your lab partner watching your equipment and lock your lab lockers after you\u0092re done; students break things all the time and some of the parts cost $30-$40 to replace. As a result, people tend to try to steal those items from others around them. In general, being both meticulous and efficient in everything you do should minimize the amount of issues that you might run into.\n\n\nIn my junior year, the only pre-med course that I had left was General Physics. Again, a good number of pre-meds end up taking this course in their sophomore year in conjunction with Organic Chemistry so if your schedule allows it, I would suggest you take them simultaneously if you think you can handle the workload as this will give you more choices later on to possibly pursue another major/minor or perhaps even graduate early. The General Physics course at NYU is also a yearlong course separated into two semesters, General Physics I and II. Historically, General Physics I can only be described as a train wreck. In the years before I took it, most of the professors were horrible, and according to my friend who took it the year before, the \u0093best\u0094 one was over 80 years old and going senile. Luckily he retired and for my year, a single professor taught the course by the name of Burton Budick. As nice of a person as he may have been, his lectures were utterly pointless. The majority of the information given during lecture was at the level of a high school physics class, but the exams required thinking and problem solving skills that were not emphasized during lecture at all. Like Orgo, Physics requires you to learn how to solve problems yourself, a skill that must be self-taught. Homework sets were not graded, but for most people it was necessary to know how to do them in order to succeed on the exams. Unlike Orgo, the final grade average is not designed to hit a specific number. However, like Orgo, your performance relative to the average will decide what grade you get (the grades are curved). Generally, 15-20 points above the average is a safe A. All exams were multiple choice with 20 questions per exam (no partial credit). From my knowledge, the professor for this course may have changed once again, so perhaps none of this is applicable anymore. It seems as if they can never find an effective professor for General Physics I.\n\nThe professors for General Physics II were much more competent. I believe Andre Adler has taught it for several years and will continue to do so in the near future. There is also another Chinese professor whose name I can\u0092t remember but from what I heard, he was also much better than Budick. This course does not assign a textbook, so the professor distributes handouts with problem sets for students to solve. Most of the problem sets are relatively straightforward and he goes over important problem solving skills that are necessary for performing well on the exams. The test format and grading is virtually identical to General Physics I.\n\nBoth semesters of physics also come with a lab component, which is fairly straightforward. Like all labs, the quality varies wildly depending on your TA, but unlike General and Organic Chemistry labs, these are divided into small sections of approximately 20-25 students each. In my experience, they were run more efficiently than any of the chemistry labs, although I have friends who have very different opinions due to the fact that we had different TAs.\n\n\nI won\u0092t go into the Biology major-specific courses that I took since I seem to have again produced a post of epic proportions. If anyone has questions regarding the Biology major, I will do my best to answer them in separate posts. If anyone who has been through any of these classes and discover something wrong or outdated, please feel free to correct me. I personally believe that in conjunction with my previous post from 2 & 1/2 years ago, this represents a relatively accurate and (hopefully) unbiased depiction of the pre-med courses offered at NYU. After writing all of this, it has not escaped my notice that in general, my descriptions here are significantly more negative compared to those in my original post after freshman year. Pre-med is perhaps one of the most academically challenging tracks that exist at most universities, and the numbers reflect that. Most universities of NYU\u0092s caliber and higher depict rosy pictures of the future to prospective freshmen by showing that they have 80-90% of students who apply to med school being accepted to at least one. What they fail to tell us is what percentage of students who enter as pre-meds actually survive to see the application process. In my year, there were roughly 500 or so freshmen that entered with the desire to pursue pre-med. I believe that after junior year ended, approximately 100, maybe a maximum of 150 students remained pre-med. Many students chose to switch to other health-related fields such as pre-dental, while others decided to do research instead or something else entirely unrelated to healthcare or science. The fact of the matter is that a large number of students cannot keep up with the workload, which I believe is at least in part due to their inability to properly judge the amount of work required for them to remain ahead of the curve. As a result, some of them do not end up with a GPA that is respectable enough to apply to med school. If there is one main lesson to be learned from this post, it is the fact that things in college generally do not become easier over time; professors tend to teach less and less while increasingly requiring us to learn by ourselves the skills required to succeed as well as implement those skills in order to make the necessary connections. In the end, although innate intelligence may help, like in all aspects of life it comes down to how dedicated and passionate you are about merely earning the privilege to apply to medical school.

People sacrifice their consciences in search for increased wealth and power more often than they dont; the consequences are clear in the context of history and life.\n\nThe Industrial Revolution was a period of substantially increased output of goods due to the mechanization of production. It was a boon to modern economies and to those at the top; however, the workers suffered. FActory owners exploited workers, subjecting women and children alike to long hours in a dangerous, filthy factory setting. This occurred because factory owners were so preoccupied with generating the greatest possible profit that they forgoed their consciences. Because of their cupidity, they viewed workers as nothing more tahn parts of the ultimate machine, parts that were unfortunately expendable. Charlie Chaplin illustrated the dehumanizing nature of the Industrial Revolution by comparing workers to cows in a satirical film. Just as cows are wanted simply for meat and milk, workers were wanted only for the money they could produce/\n\nThe Crucible, a dramatized play about the Salem Witch Trials, also demonstrates that in most cases, people act according to their own selfish desires. The title of the play, \"The Crucible\", refers to a container in which things are boiled. The story is named so because as one event leads to another, the situation becomes out of control and reaches a boil - a boil fueled by human selfishness. Abigail, a young girl with a talent for deception, begins the dreadful series of witchcraft accusations in order to escape punishment for her own frivolous and bordering on Satanic activities in the forest. With the help of her cronies, she fools everyone into believing that she was forced by witches into such conduct. Though it begins as mere accusations, eventually the situation escalates to the point where a list of women to be hanged is compiled. This occurs because of the selfishness in people's hearts. Those who knew the whole thing was ridiculous stayed quiet to save their own skins while many others actually aggravated the situation by accusing others in order to gain their land or to exact vengeance for petty disputes in the past. Though there are a few morally sound characters in the story, the sad reality is that the minority cannot defeat the overwhelming majority. The tragedies of the Salem Witchcraft trials are shown by the Crucible to have occurred because the vast majority of the villagers motivated by selfish desires.\n\n\n\nEssay 2 Prompt:is success always a good thing\n\nSuccess does not always engender health and happiness. Sometimes, it in fact can be destructive towards oneself. There can be unexpected consequences in striving for and achieving a goal, consequences which ruin the benefit of the success.\n\nRobert Schumann, a talented composer and pianist during the Romantic period of music, valued musical success so highly that he ended up crippling his career and ruining his life. EArly in his life, he composed quite a few well known pieces of piano music; however, he was not satisfied with just this. Though he was already sucessful, he still wanted more success. Schumann felt that his techncal skills were not adequate enough to be considered virtuouso level. Thus, an inexorable obsession to be the best conquered and commanded his entire being, driving him to extremes in order to achieve his goal. Unsatisfied with the strenght and agility of his ring finger, he t ried various techniques, such as taping it to an adjacent finger, in order to strengthen it. Tragically, his lack of restraint in practicing left his ring finger paralyzed. The benefit of his success was eradicated by his desire for more success. With nothing left to live for, Schumman attempted and failed suicide twice; finally, he was placed in an asylum to protect him from himself. IN the case of Schumann, sccuess destroyed his life.\n\nThe French and Britihs success in forcing Germany to comply to thte repressive Treaty of Versailles would have unforeseen and globally signifcant consequences. During WWI, death and destruction like never before ran rampant. Millions died in bloody standoffs in which opposing sides hid in trenches and essentially sent troops over to the other side to die until everyone was dead. Upon winniing the war, Britain and France wanted to exact as harsh a vengeance as possible upon the Germans. Despite opposition from Woodrow Wilson ,the president of the US, Britain and France were able to successfully coerce Germany into agreeing to the Treaty of Versailles, which imposed excessively harsh conditions upon the Germans. However, The Allies' success in pushing all blame onto the Germans and forcing them to pay reparations would ultimately result in an even more disastrous conflict - WWII.\nIn certain situations, success can bring about negative results. Sometimes, it is better to not achieve everything one desires - doing so could result in dire consequences.

I entered college confident I wanted to go into aerospace; a couple weeks sitting in on an upper div aerodynamics class changed that. Unfortunately, no other interest rose to take its place. While my classmates were excited about learning skills for their dream jobs in automotive industries and design, I grew disinterested in the work. I pursued non-scientific interests in politics and writing, attending talks and joining activist groups such as CalPIRG. Were it not for the Drake Scholarship binding me to Mech. Eng., I might have switch to pursue an academic career in Political Science. Only near the end of my sophomore year, guided by some of my engineering friends, did I decide to try out a research position. When I came back my junior year, I started work in the Biomechanics Lab.\n\nThe research was my second wind. My assignment was to assemble and process high resolution vertebral models to help understand how vertebral bone failed.  With any luck, the results would validate an experimental in-vitro procedure for diagnosing osteoporosis.  The study was cutting-edge and no one had used such high resolution models before. This was the sort of work I could see myself doing in the future.\n\nA year and a half at the lab has taught me, if nothing else, that research takes time.  Only recently were preliminary results from two studies I coauthored accepted for presentation at the 53rd Orthopedic Research Society meeting.  Hopefully, one of these studies will be at a stage we can publish before I graduate.\n\nStill, the process has prepared me for all the other rigors of graduate research. I have had to learn numerous computer skills just to advance my project, from writing scripts with Python to programming in C. More than any programming class, the work has taught me how to optimize code to process large data samples. Now, I am learning how to write code to visualize our finite element models under loading. In addition to technical skills, my presentation skills have also gone up from explaining and defending my work to the graduate students and my research advisor.\n\nMost importantly, the work has taught me how to handle the unexpected. By definition, experiments often yield unexpected results. This problem is even more prevalent in computer simulations, when you have to determine whether such results are physical oddities or whether your code is faulty. In some cases, odd results provide even greater insights than if the experiment had gone as planned. My work has prepared me to analyze my results and determine what they truly mean.\n\nMy second regret is not discovering nanotechnology sooner. This too, happened my junior year and was actually brought about by a political science class. While researching Iranian OPEC status, I started running across articles outlining how global oil production would likely peak and then be unable to match demand. What really struck me was that the \u0093crackpots\u0094 making these claims were people like Alan Greenspan, professors from Caltech, and Nobel winners Richard Smalley. I was a man obsessed that semester, working on my bone research at the lab, then coming home, scribbling down some answers to homework and spending the rest of my night poring over statistical formulas to analyze oil production charts. An optimist by nature, I quickly switched to exploring solutions. My research led me to discover CdSe quantum dots \u0096 tiny tunable photovoltaic converters that held great promise for absorbing the full spectrum of visible light. It was my first technical encounter with nanotechnology.\n\nMy research led me to sign up for the Intro to Nanotechnology course.  Through lectures, guest speakers and journal articles, the class thrust me to the technical forefront of the field. For our independent study, I convinced my group to examine quantum dot solar cell technology. It was exhilarating just reading through published research, coming up with ideas regarding assembly and heterostructure that even the leading minds hadn\u0092t considered. So, I continued to the MEMS course. Here, we spent more time on theory and fabrication methodology. For this project, my group is investigating energy generation in the microworld. By exploiting the Debye length, we have designed an array of nanochannels that serve as a microscale osmo-electric conversion system.\n\nStudying at Berkeley has granted me the opportunity to discuss projects with the professors and graduate students who did the initial research. This is the sort of experience I want in my graduate education, and since _____ is at the forefront of nanoscale research, I am sure I will gain it here.  In my classroom and independent studies I have come across _____\u0092s work on ______ and ________\u0092s work on  ______, and I would really enjoy furthering the knowledge of such projects.\n\nI wish I had discovered my passion for nanotechnology research earlier. However, As N.W. Dougherty famously said, \u0093The ideal engineer is a composite ... He is not a scientist, he is not a mathematician, he is not a sociologist or a writer; but he may use the knowledge and techniques of any or all of these disciplines in solving engineering problems.\u0094 My research and classwork have prepared me to pursue graduate work in the nano sciences, and, in all likelihood, will lead me to pursue a Ph.D. afterwards.  However, I have not forgotten the breath of my experience at Berkeley. As I intend to pursue a career in industry, the non-technical skills I gained will be invaluable to my future. The next two decades will be a formative period for the nanotechnology industry and I want to shape it commercially, as well as scientifically. My path to nano-engineering was not a simple one, but in retrospect, every stage of my journey has gotten me one step closer towards being an ideal engineer.

I was wondering if CC could please take some time out of their schedule and grade my essay? It would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThe prompt is from the Gruber's book, which actually has weird prompts because the whole prompt is a question, not just the first line. Oh well, here goes:\n\n\"One of the main purposes of education is to get students excited about the \"process\" behind problem solving instead of rushing into an answer and just concentrating on the final result. Often students can extract something from a problem that leads to the answer. Students can relax and think more clearly when they concentrate on the game or the wonderful process, if you will, thinking\"\n-Adapted from G. Gruber, \"A Superlative Guide to the Hows and Wise,\" Omni Magazine\n\nAssignment: Do you agree with the above quote? In many cases is the problem solver concerned just about getting the answer, and not about concentrating on the \"process\" to get the answer? Do you agree that by not having faith in the process, he or she often does not arrive at the solution?\n\n\n\"The journey is more important than the destination.\" The road in this case, like Gruber mentioned, is the same with learning. Current students caught up in the importance of grades and results often mistakenly think the goal of learning is to achieve excellence in the form of marks. They overlook the process of learning in their rush for products.\n\nI'm currently attending an IB (International Baccalaureate) High School. During the Freshman Orientation two years ago, the counselor mentioned the importance of learning for the sake of learning, not for any ephemeral and fleeting rewards. Throughout my years in high school up to today, there has been a constant emphasis on learning from the process, with the result only as a side product. In my Theory of Knowledge class this year, when we were assigned quizzes or tests, it is very rare that any of us get less than a 70. This is because the teacher believes that there are no wrong answers. As long as a student puts something down and justifies it, then it the response deserves at least partial credit. Justification is praised as the most important step in problem solving because it shows the problem solver's knowledge of the problem and what he gained form it. Countless students are simply reciting formulas and plugging numbers into their calculators for results. However, when asked to justify or explain the process, they're stumped. IB teaches me to value the experience, similar to what Gruber says in his quote.\n\nKarl Marx once stated that a man's work is a reflection of himself. To succeed, one must love his work and have faith in it. Conversely, one who is unemployed is therefore empty: he has nothing to express himself with. This is the same with problem solvers. To arrive at the solution, the problem solver must have faith in the process. He, firstly, must believe it works. Only then can he convince others that he is right. If from the start the didn't even think he was right, then any answer he gets is pointless because the problem solver himself doesn't even believe it.\n\nIn today's world, the general populace is obsessed with achieving results in the fastest ways possible. People no longer appreciate the why, but are simply more focused with the how. When they only concentrate on getting the results in the most efficient manner, they often lose something in the process. They lose the knowledge and the importance of the journey. In a mad dash to the destination, most people simply forget the learning experience and don't carry anything with them into the future. All they know is that the square root of 16 is 4. They don't know why.\n\n\nThat's it CC! I tried to add a more personal touch to this one, not sure if graders will like that (read: first example with IB). Thanks for your time!

In the process of doing so, they put into account many different factors. It is important to make good choices, for life itself is merely a linkage of the results of such different choices. Although others may say that ones life is rather formed through one actions, because making choices is the start of any result,  peoples lives are ultimately the result of the many choices they make.\n\nPeople are all in different situations, some that are harmful while others are in supportive environments. While we cannot control the innate situations we are put in, people have the power to make better choices for themselves.. Michael Jordan , considered as one of the greatest basketball players of all time, may not have had the chance to attain such title had he failed to make the right choice at the right time. Although most people only remember Jordan as being a basketball player, he actually spent a part of his time pursuing a career in baseball. He quit basketball to play baseball, an obviously bad choice since Jordan was not much good at baseball. After failing to produce results in baseball, Jordan made one of the best decisions in his life.   He chose to quit baseball and return to the game of basketball. In the end Michael Jordan is remembered as a great man, who made the right choices at the right time.\n\nOn the other hand, there are cases where the best choices, may not have the best effect on ones life. The great decisions by the fifteenth president of the United States, Abraham Lincoln, change the fate of America. Prior to there being any direct military contact between the Union and the Confederate states, the to sides of the US were hotly debating the issue of slavery. As tensions got more intense, the desperate Confederates decided to attack the Union fort, Fort Sumner. In the aftermath of such attack, Lincoln was put into a difficult situation. He could either retaliate and start a civil war in the meaning of freeing slavery, or do nothing and let the Confederates get away for the attack, ensuring that the country will have no chance of becoming segregated. In the end he chose the first option, and luckily freed slavery while maintaing the US as well/ Unfortunately for Lincoln, he was eventually killed as a retaliation for such decision. In the end, it was once again decisions that, once again, changed the life of a man.\n\nFinally, in the novel \u0093The Catcher in the Rye\u0094 by J.D Salinger, the main character Holden, views the world in a negative light, calling most things as being \u0093phony\u0094. Attending a good boarding school and being from a moderately wealthy family background, Holden is from a background to make good choices. Despite having such benefits, he decides instead to neglect his school, his friends and most of society as well, once again calling them phony. He makes the right choice in deciding to go on a weekend trip to New York, hoping to clear out his mind but once again gets into trouble by making bad choices. He calls a prostitute and insults her, picks fight with strangers, and secretly meets his sister. Despite his good fortunes Holden decided, on his own will, to make bad choices. As a result, his life, just like the choices he made, turned out to be dark, pessimistic and gloomy.\n\nThere are innate characteristics that significantly influences ones life. Factors such as family background, appearance and talent may shape the course of ones life, yet from both the lives of many people and the stories of literary works, we can see that making good, and sometimes fortunate choices is much more influential. All people have the power to make choices that will cover, or make more vulnerable both their strong and weak points.\n\nIn conclusion, throughout life people are put into constant dilemnas, having to decide among many choices. Although some choices may be more significant than others, people must still carefully lay out the cost and benefits of each choices. In the end, it is the accumulation of such choices, not any innate or outside factors, that will shape the outcome of ones life.

Both Alexander Fleming and Gregory Mendel are notable scientists who made extremely significant discoveries even though they were not focussed on that aspect of their field.\n\nUpon inception, penicillin was regarded as a wonder-drug that could cure any illness and this new cure resolved many ailments from gangrene to tuberculosis. However, its discovery was actually a result of a complete accident by Alexander Fleming who was not out to find such a pill, \u0093When I woke up...I certainly didn\u0092t plan to revolutionise all medicine. But I suppose that was exactly what I did.\u0094 This quote encapsulates the idea that Fleming\u0092s discovery of penicillin was completely by chance and that he was not focused on one aspect of life. Fleming was a professor at the University of London as well as serving throughout WWI as a medic illustrating his lack of focus on just one subject. From this we can understand that not all important discoveries are the result of focusing on one facet of science and life.\n\nAnother major discovery in the scientific world was made by Gregory Mendel, posthumously credited as the father of genetics. His realisation that traits could be transmitted across generations through his work with peas was completely by accident. Through his mathematical acumen, he was able to sort through thousands of entries about the different colours of the peas he was growing at his monastery and realised that these colours could be predicted through probability. This fortuitous discovery was not the result of his focus upon just one subject as he was involved within his monastery, furthering his amateur mathematics as well as taking care of many bee hives and other plants highlighting that focusing on one subject does not always play an important role in discoveries.\n\nFrom close analysis of both scientists\u0092 lives we can see that focusing on one subject does not always lead to discoveries as both Mendel and Fleming made their findings fortuitously. While many figures and discoveries are a result of dedicated focus on one subject many others are not and thus it is incorrect to claim that all important discoveries are the result of focusing on one subject.

His discovery resulted in the colonization of the Americas by many Europeans. Prince Henry\u2019s expedition along the West Coast of Africa led to the increase interactions with the Africans.  Europe\u2019s interactions with the isolated Americas and the newly discovered parts of Africa around 1492-1750 would lead to a new form of global trade called \u201cThe Columbian Exchange\u201d. The latter result of the Columbian Exchange produced a new form of labor to replace the encomienda system, the enslavement of Africans. As the European\u2019s diseases began to wipeout the Native population and the import of Africans replaced the encomienda system, the Native Americans were no longer needed to the Europeans which resulted in their displacement. Several aspects of life still remained such as taxation, women\u2019s rights, and Europe\u2019s dominance in trade.\n\nEurope\u2019s encounter with America and Africa led to a widespread exchange of plants, animals, slaves, diseases, and culture called the Columbian Exchange. The effect of the Columbian exchange was the growth of the population in the Americas. A part of the exchange was the shipping of slaves from Africa to the Americas to work as laborers. Europeans in search of religious freedom, adventure, and a better life began to settle in the Americas. The Columbian exchange brought new types of plants, foods, and animals to each continent. The Europeans brought sheep, goats, cattles, and pigs which increased the milk and meat supply in America. They also brought the horse, which provided a new and easier form of transportation. Coffee which was implanted in Africa flourished in the Americas. The Americans also traded with Egypt and Indian for cotton. Tobacco and cacao became popular luxurious goods in Europe. The increase of corn and potato yields sent to Europe and Africa saved many of the population.  Unfortunately, the Columbian Exchange brought diseases from Europe to the Americas. Due to the isolation of the Americas from Europe for so long, the natives had no immunity to the diseases such as measles and small pox causing half of the native American population to die.\n\nAs the diseases began to wipe out the Native American population, the demand for free/inexpensive labor increased. The outcome of this was the enslavement of Africans. Because plantation labor required no skill, and the Americas were a foreign land to the Africans, they were chosen to work as slaves. They were placed into ships and chained together, some were on top of each other, the ships were filled with them and there was no room to move around freely. Half of them did not survive the voyage and the remaining was sold in the slave market to plantation owners. Most of the Africans enslaved were separated from their loved ones who were sold to different slave owners. Their children were also enslaved and separated at such a young age from their parents. It\u2019s also said that the darker ones were usually the ones working outdoors while the lighter ones were indoors.\n\nThe colonization of Europeans into the new world led to the displacement of the Native Americans. The Europeans were dominant because they had guns, advanced technology, and the diseases they were immune to unlike the natives. As slaves began to replace the Native Americans, they were no longer needed to the Europeans. The outcome was their displacement; they were forced into reservations in the desert. They went through what is called \u201cThe Trail of Tears\u201d where they were driven out of their homes into Southern States and some assembled in various camps. More than half of the Native American population died in their harsh journey due to conditions such as lack of food, bad weather, sickness, and lack of rest. They fought back but it led to no avail.\n\nAn aspect of history that remained during the 1492-1750 interaction with Europe, Africa, and America was taxation. Britain taxed the Americans for goods they imported .The goods the people bought were taxed and the money went towards the government. A lot of things back in the 1492-1750 were not sold without having to pay tax.\n\nIn regards of women\u2019s status, it stayed the same; they were still inferior to men. Their duties were still to their husband, the house and raising their kids. Men were preferred over women, and they were paid less than men. They haven\u2019t really acquired major political and social rights.\n\nEurope\u2019s dominance in trade was another aspect that also remained. They traded with many countries and their merchants acquired most of the world\u2019s goods. The Americas also paid a tribute through taxation to them when they exchanged with one another. Basically they were still on top of trade, and they traded with mostly every country.\n\nTo sum up, the 1492-1750 interaction with Europe, Africa, and the Americas resulted in both economic and social changes and continuity. A new form of global trade arose that brought several goods to each country that changed its way of life. Another was a replacement of the encomienda system with slavery which resulted in the displacement of the natives.  The discovery of the new world led to the age of exploration which resulted in increase of trade and encounter of different countries. Interactions bring several changes that benefit one and help shape a country economically and socially. While things still remain, other interactions or actions will soon change the world but there will always be an aspect of history that still remains.

Seeing music as the perfect medium for such an event, as the majority of us were musicians in bands outside of school, we decided to put together a concert in the backyard of one of our houses.  I, as well as several others, ended up being jointly responsible for the booking, organizing, promotion, as well as performance at the show, which became one of the \u0093hottest\u0094 events of the school year for several high schools.  The organization went as far as to provide services such as food, security and valet parking for all patrons.  The show brought in over 500 students to see 4 bands (all of which played free of charge, and one of which I was the drummer of) in an incredible live setting (rented sound equipment, rented lights, beautiful backyard), and raised money in the mid-thousands, 100% of which was donated to the High School (all service expenses were paid for out of pocket) for the building of a memorial in the form of a score-board for the soccer field.\n\n-Concert for Charity at the Local Jewish Community Center (11) \u0096 Seeing the incredible results in the previous year\u0092s backyard concert, two of my good friends and I decided to put on another similar show, this time donating to charity rather than the communit3 y.  bands performed, 2 of which I was in.

The show was an exhausting but overall a very fulfilling endeavor; while we met many setbacks (such as lighting equipment not being delivered properly and poor early ticket sales that nearly forced us to cancel), in the end, the event was a great success, and brought in a surprisingly large sum of money for Cancer Research.\n\n-Intern for Local Legislature \u0096 Presiding Officer  (11, 12 - ~2.5 hrs/week all year long) - This was and continues to be an incredible experience in seeing the inner workings of politics.

The main purpose of the equation is to allow scientists to quantify the uncertainty of the factors which determine the number of extraterrestrial civilizations.\n\nThe Drake equation is closely related to the Fermi paradox. It was cited by Gene Roddenberry as supporting the multiplicity of starfaring civilizations shown in Star Trek, the television show he created.\n\nThe Drake equation states that:\n\n\nwhere:\n\nN is the number of civilizations in our galaxy with which we might expect to be able to communicate\nand\n\nR* is the rate of star formation in our galaxy\nfp is the fraction of those stars which have planets\nne is average number of planets which can potentially support life per star that has planets\nfl is the fraction of the above which actually go on to develop life\nfi is the fraction of the above which actually go on to develop intelligent life\nfc is the fraction of the above which are willing and able to communicate\nL is the expected lifetime of such a civilization\nContents [hide]\n1 Historical estimates of the Drake equation parameters\n2 Current estimates of the Drake equation parameters\n3 See also\n4 External links\n5 References\n\n\n\n[edit]\nHistorical estimates of the Drake equation parameters\nConsiderable disagreement on the values of most of these parameters exists, but the values used by Drake and his colleagues in 1961 were:\n\nR* = 10/year,\nfp = 0.5,\nne = 2,\nfl = 1,\nfi = fc = 0.01,\nand L = 10 years.\nThe value of R* is the least disputed. fp is more uncertain, but is still much firmer than the values following. Confidence in ne was once higher, but the discovery of numerous gas giants in close orbit with their stars has introduced doubt that life-supporting planets commonly survive the creation of their stellar systems. In addition, most stars in our galaxy are red dwarfs, which have little of the ultraviolet radiation that has contributed to the evolution of life on Earth. Instead they flare violently, mostly in X-rays \u0097 a property not conducive to life as we know it (simulations also suggest that these bursts erode planetary atmospheres). The possibility of life on moons of gas giants (e.g. Jupiter's satellite Europa) adds further uncertainty to this figure.\n\nEvidence currently available to humanity suggests that fl is very high; life on Earth appears to have begun almost immediately after conditions arrived in which it was possible, suggesting that abiogenesis is relatively \"easy\" once conditions are right. But this evidence is limited in scope, and so this term remains in considerable dispute. One piece of data which would have major impact on this term is the controversy over whether there is evidence of life on Mars. The conclusion that life on Mars developed independently from life on Earth would argue for a high value for this term.\n\nfi, fc, and L are obviously little more than guesses. fi has been affected by discoveries that the solar system's orbit is circular in the galaxy, at such a distance that it remains out of the spiral arms for hundreds of millions of years (evading radiation from novae). Also, Earth's very large, unusual moon appears to aid retention of hydrogen by breaking up the crust, inducing a magnetosphere by tidal heating and stirring, and stabilizing the planet's axis of rotation. In addition while it appears that life developed soon after the formation of Earth, the Cambrian explosion in which a large variety of multicellular life forms came into being occurred considerable amounts of time after the formation of Earth, which suggests the possibility that special conditions were necessary for this to occur. In addition some scenarios such as the Snowball Earth or research into the extinction events have raised the possibility that life on Earth is relatively fragile. Again, the controversy over life on Mars is relevant since a discovery that life did form on Mars but ceased to exist would affect estimates of these terms.\n\nThe well-known astronomer Carl Sagan speculated that all of the terms, except for the lifetime of a civilization, are relatively high and the determining factor in whether there are large or small numbers of civilizations in the universe is the civilization lifetime, or in other words, the ability of technological civilizations to avoid self-destruction. In Sagan's case, the Drake equation was a strong motivating factor for his interest in environmental issues and his efforts to warn against the dangers of nuclear warfare.\n\n(Note, however, that in the year 2001 a value of 50 for L can be used with exactly the same degree of confidence that Drake had in using 10 in the year 1961.)\n\nThe remarkable thing about the Drake equation is that by plugging in apparently fairly plausible values for each of the parameters above, the resultant expectant value of N is generally often >> 1. This has provided considerable motivation for the SETI movement. However, this conflicts with the currently observed value of N = 1 \u0097 one observed civilization in the entire universe. Other assumptions give values of N that are << 1, in accord with the observable evidence.\n\nThis conflict is often called the Fermi paradox, after Enrico Fermi who first publicised the subject, and suggests that our understanding of what is a \"conservative\" value for some of the parameters may be overly optimistic or that some other factor is involved to suppress the development of intelligent space-faring life.\n\nOther assumptions give values of N that are << 1, but some observers believe this is still compatible with observations due to the anthropic principle: no matter how low the probability that any given galaxy will have intelligent life in it, the galaxy that we are in must have at least one intelligent species by definition. There could be hundreds of galaxies in our galactic cluster with no intelligent life whatsoever, but of course we would not be present in those galaxies to observe this fact.\n\nSome computations of the Drake equation, given different assumptions:\n\nR* = 10/year, fp = 0.5, ne = 2, fl = 1, fi = fc = 0.01, and L = 50 years\nN = 10 \u00d7 0.5 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 0.01 \u00d7 0.01 \u00d7 50 = 0.05\nAlternatively, making some more optimistic assumptions, and assuming that 10% of civilizations become willing and able to communicate, and then spread through their local star systems for 100,000 years (a very short period in geologic time):\n\nR* = 20/year, fp = 0.1, ne = 0.5, fl = 1, fi = 0.5, fc = 0.1, and L = 100,000 years\nN = 20 \u00d7 0.1 \u00d7 0.5 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 0.5 \u00d7 0.1 \u00d7 100000 = 5000\n[edit]\nCurrent estimates of the Drake equation parameters\nThis section attempts to list best current estimates for the parameters of the Drake equation.\n\nR* = the rate of star creation in our galaxy\n\nEstimated by Drake as 10/year. Latest calculations from NASA and the European Space Agency indicates that the current rate of star formation in our galaxy is about 6 per year.

However, the susceptibility of our best plans to unexpected events does not mean that the unheralded resulting outcome is detrimental to our overall wellbeing.  This stance is polemically argued throughout Dazai's novel The Setting Sun and Marquez's masterful novel Chronicle of a Death Foretold.\n\nThe Setting Sun finds the protagonist, Kazuko, slavishly dependent upon her mother.  Despite nearing almost thirty years of age, Kazuko is still fawning towards her mother.  Kazuko feels that she owes her mother a debt, and as so has an outward demeanour of insolvency.  She clandestinely plans to remain with her mother for the foreseeable future; however, this plan is conspicuously interrupted by her mother's unheralded mortal illness.  When the mother falls ill and eventually dies, Kazuko suffers a mental breakdwon -- what is she supposed to do when her plan has ben interrupted?  However, as a result of her mother's death, Kazuko gains the courage to pursue a chimerical love within her own life  She quickly fins it within the character of Mr. Oh.  Mr. Oh provides her with an outlet for her passion; while at the same time azuko gains autonomy.  Therefore, from this example, it can be seen that the ruin of Kazuko's initial plan lead to an unexpected gain -- a deep love;  this shows that the unexpected event was in actuality for the better.\n\nIn Marquez's novela Chronicle of a Death Foretold, a unnamed narrator is exploring the reasons for a public murder.  He pieces together events from the past to draw a single conclusion: that the murder occured due to an unexpected occurance.  Twenty years before -- when the murder took place -- a ostentatious and pretentious man named Bayardo arrived at a mundane spanish village.  There, he eclectically chose a young woman to wed, and they spent the following weeks arranging for a byzantine wedding.  Unfortunately, on the night of the wedding, Bayrdo discovered that Angela -- his newfound wife -- was in actuality not a virgin.  This quickly drew the proceedings to a halt, as Bayardo shamefully returned his bride to her family and left town.  Although this may initially seem as taboo towards the town, in actuality the village was able to benefit from the departure of Bayardo.

Because of that, I transfered to a distance learning high school (Keystone, if you're familiar with distance learning).  My mom doesn't have the money to pay for it, so I work about 25 hours a week to pay for my own private schooling and to help support my family.  The thing about distance learning is that even though I'm getting a better education, my application is \"damaged\" by an impersonal counselor recommendation and an impersonal teacher recommendation (especially since Stanford \"strongly recommends\" recs from 11/12 grade teachers).\n\nHere are the other schools I'm applying to, in order of how likely I believe I am to get into them (from least likely to most likely).

This is especially because I'm extremely pressed for money and I'd rather put in applications at schools likely to give me a full ride.\n\nAbout Me:\nName: applicannot\nYear: rising senior\nRace: African American\nSex: female\nIncome: >$25,000 (family of 3)\nState: Maryland\n\nStats:\nGPA: 3.84UW  <-- This is my GPA including my freshman year, in which I had a 4.0 because, well, freshman year is easiest!  I will probably have a 4.0 the first half of my senior year (I'll explain), which means my GPA will still be a 3.84UW (school does not weight or rank).  My 10/11 GPA is 3.76.\nSAT: 2250 (720M, 750CR, 780WR, 10 essay, one sitting of two)\nSAT Subject Tests: 670 Lit, 730 US History, 700 Math II  <-- I'm thinking of re-taking the subject test for Lit (and maybe Math I, although Math II is really a lost cause).  Because I get a fee waiver for the actual test and each test comes with four free score sends, I'll save money in the application process by re-taking the Lit subject test.  And I really, really need to save money.  Stanford is Subject Test optional - should I send them?  My scores aren't bad, but they're not really Stanford material.\nAP Exams: Euro 4, US History 5, English Lit 5, EnviSci 4\nRigor: 6 AP courses, 10 honors courses <-- I had planned on taking eight AP courses, but my school changed the policy for this year, so I'll only be able to take two AP courses - not the four I had planned.  Because that's I'll have a light schedule compared to what I'm used to (not necessarily less rigorous but playing to my strengths), I should be able to get a 4.0 the first semester of my senior year.\n\nECs:\n1.  My primary EC is my work experience.  I've worked 25 hours per week for the last year (over a year and a half by the time I submit my application), and 16 hours a week for about a year before that.  I work to pay for my own schooling and to help support my family.\n2.  I am the Junior President (two years) of my community organization.  I spend about 10 hours a week volunteering.  I manage a budget, recruit and direct the youth members, volunteer around the neighborhood (we do oddjobs, basically), oversee and host community events, etc.\n3.  I spent two years as a Youth Member of my community organization.  Not much different than above, just without the administrative duties.  As a side note, I live in a beach-side community that sees mostly rich people who have their second homes there, which is why we have such a nice community organization.  We just own a cottage there, so it's our only house and everything.\n4.  I was Freshman Speaker of the Council (appointed) and Sophomore Executive Board (elected) president.  I was in the SGA.  These were at my old public school.\n\nSubjective Elements:\nOf course I don't know how my essays will be.  I do know that my counselor recommendation will be informative but impersonal.  It should explain the distance learning system really well.  If my teacher recs have to come from 11th or 12th grade, they will be crappy because you don't get to know your teachers very well through distance learning.  If I am allowed to get one rec from ninth or tenth grade, it should be good, but I can't judge, having not read it.  Is there anything I can do to mitigate these effects?  My major is IR and a second major, but I haven't decided what to put yet.  I put my occupation down as \"social scientist other\" and filled in \"International Community Organizer/Capacity Builder\".\n\nThis year I took Honors English 3, AP English Lit (I doubled up so I could take an English class at the college this year, but I can't afford it, so my plans got all screwed up and I have to take an English elective my senior year), Honors Geography, AP US History, AP Environmental Science, Calculus, and Japanese I.  Next year I will take AP Statistics, AP Economics (macro and micro), Physics, Creative Writing, Contemporary World Issues (I know it sounds like a blow-off class but it's right up my alley and I know I will enjoy it), and Japanese II.  I already have three years of Spanish.\n\nI know this is ridiculously long.  I'm so sorry.  I appreciate any feedback.

Unfortunately, I didn't come to that conclusion until I accumulated over 100,000 dollars in debt; a virtual black hole of screaming nothingness that threatens to swallow me whole on a daily basis.\n\nWho am I? Well, I am somebody that has made some mistakes \u2013 I will certainly admit to that. The first pitfall I stumbled into was listening to my parents, my peers, and my teachers, all of whom urged me to take my relatively-high SAT scores and good grades and turn them into a degree. By the time I graduated high school, I was chomping at the bit \u2013 virtually drunk with excitement over my coming journey into adulthood via the University of Connecticut.\n\nFour and a half frenetic years later, I graduated with a double major degree in history and geography and still didn't have a clue what I wanted to do with my life. I quickly discovered that, due to my choice in majors \u2013 neither of which I was ever for even a moment counseled against selecting \u2013 my degree was virtually worthless. I couldn't teach at public school because I didn't have a certificate, I couldn't teach at most private schools because they wanted people with actual classroom experience (which is fair), and I couldn't work in a museum \u2013 an industry that was booming at the time \u2013 because they required a masters.\n\nI did have a mild amount of skill in writing and editing, and after dicking around in a night auditing job at an Econolodge for 10 months \u2013 a period during which I drank heavily \u2013 I managed to land a position as a reporter for a local collection of newspapers. The work wasn't challenging, and only paid 29k, but it was enough to at least mail off the bills every month, although I couldn't afford to live outside my parents' house. As a bachelor at the time, it wasn\u2019t that big a deal.\n\nA few years passed and the newspaper's owners, a nice couple who had worked in the business for nearly 30 years, abruptly decided to sell, and the new ownership made it clear very quickly that big changes were in the offing \u2013 in particular, the likely elimination of my department. At about this time, I met the woman who would be my future wife. She was living and going to college in Texas, a good 1,000 miles away, and \u2013 with things looking rather bleak in my career \u2013 I moved down there to be with her, landing a job as a social studies teacher at a charter school in Austin. The work was horrid; the school being run by a Turkish organization that had a barely-disguised hatred for all things American. There were no U.S. flags displayed in the school, no student ever said the pledge of allegiance, no child attending the school ever played an American sport like football or baseball, and children of hispanic or white decent were openly discriminated against in favor of a minority population of Turkish ancestry.\n\nI parted ways with the school after a year, and with the economy rapidly going south and no realistic prospects on the horizon, I decided to go back to college. I still loved history, and I thought that \u2013 perhaps with a little more training \u2013 I might go on to get my PhD and teach college.\n\nBut although I was an exceptional student, I was repulsed by academia this time around. I couldn\u2019t stand the overt liberal bias, the additional amount of money and time that would be required to get the degree was going to be staggering, and \u2013 worst of all \u2013 I learned that the job market for history professors was apparently almost nonexistent. Perhaps the most damning thing of all, however, was the simple fact that my classmates were in many cases borderline handicapped, such was their mental acuity.\n\nWhile I accepted that a certain percentage of absolutely mindless individuals would slime their way into undergraduate degrees, I wasn\u2019t prepared to face the same bumbling of fools in this higher echelon. Everywhere I turned there were people with monstrous deficiencies that should have precluded their attending a school like this: a complete, and total inability to write coherently; profound struggles with basic comprehension; ghastly attendance records \u2013 the list ran on and on.\n\nAfter one semester, all I wanted to do was escape, and thanks to a bout of summer school and loading up on classes in my final 8 months, I was able to break out with a degree in a year and a half.\n\nBut what I found on the outside was a hopeless desert of prospects. It was if a bomb had gone off. The economy had caused the museum business to virtually collapse. What hiring was going on was directed \u2013 not at people with master\u2019s degrees anymore \u2013 but at individuals with decades of experience. A job that I might have been able to land as a fresh MA graduate 5 years prior was now reserved only for people my parents\u2019 age \u2013 I need not bother applying.\n\nMy wife, who graduated with her undergraduate degree at the same time as me (her\u2019s in elementary education \u2013 a far more practical choice than mine, one would think) could find no real work either, and so we moved in with my parents, where we have been living for the past seven months. I am married, nearly 30, and I am sharing two rooms with my wife in my parents\u2019 basement.\n\nI cannot describe the agony that we are both in.\n\nWe want to have independent, self-sufficient lives. We want to own a house; own vehicles; have children, and NONE of these things are possible as it stands now. Unable to find a real job, I slipped back into the newspaper business; a field that is on its heels, and will likely never recover from the rapid dawn of the internet age. My pay? One third of what it was four years prior. My wife is doing no better \u2013 she\u2019s cleaning up dirty diapers at a daycare center.\n\nBoth of us have bills\u2026 oh-so-many bills. We could swim in our debt. We could build little boats and push off from the beach and sail for hours without seeing the other side of it. But beyond that endless horizon, we have simply lost hope. It has now been a decade since I first entered my undergraduate career, and I have never once worked a job that paid enough money for me to be financially independent; that paid REAL money. I didn\u2019t sign up for college to make 30k a year for the rest of my life \u2013 I was promised; almost assured by the prognosticators of my distant youth that, in getting a higher education, I was casting my net into a bay of infinite plenty.\n\nThat was a lie.\n\nAnd, in coming to realize this, I have zeroed in on two magnificently clear truisms about degrees:\n\n1)\tFirst, college is only good if you are learning a practical trade, and if you are unfortunate enough to graduate during uncertain times, even this is meaningless. The simple fact of the matter is that in nearly all fields, experience trumps education. There are, of course glass ceilings that you can\u2019t breach without possessing a degree, but in order to position yourself to even look up at those lofty heights, you have to have experience. This is the problem with college (and, in particular, with majors such as my MA in history); without the PhD, or some level of accompanying experience (say, 5 years of grant-writing for charities), the degree itself is worthless. This is the same thing that\u2019s true for psychology and philosophy and social sciences majors \u2013 everyone like me who was suckered into these classes because we liked what we were learning but didn\u2019t have any realistic plans of getting our PhDs. Our degrees, we found, were passcards and not keys \u2013 we could wave them idly as we strode confidently through the checkpoints that required it, but they wouldn\u2019t open any doors, and they certainly wouldn\u2019t position us to get to the checkpoints.\n\n2)\tSecond, college is a scam. It a massively-overblown lie that has developed out of a misguided attempted during the 1960s to bring education to the masses.\n\nWhy is this a bad thing? Because EVERYONE has some kind of an education these days. If you turned back the clock half a century, a ridiculously small percentage of the population had degrees. Why? Well, very few industries required an education to succeed \u2013 success instead being built around a triad of experience, seniority and personal production, and thus only those who were driven enough to seek an education for its merits actually got one. Oh, and they were a lot more difficult to get, but more on that in a moment.\n\nEnter the 1960s, and that all changed. Here were planted the ugly seeds of equality and opportunity. At almost the same moment that people began to believe that everybody should go the college, applicants decided that a good way to differentiate themselves from other candidates was to flash a shiny new degree (the G.I. Bill certainly didn\u2019t help matters). The result was that not only were a lot more people attending college than ever before, but a lot more businesses began to expect at least some kind of degree in order for a candidate to pass muster.\n\nGrind forward 50 years, and you have the mess that we\u2019re in now: where high school students who aren\u2019t really cut out for book learnin\u2019, let alone real research, are told that they are either going to go to college or destroy their lives by failing to attend. Meanwhile, universities have mushroomed into huge, multi-billion dollar businesses who are far more interested in raking in titanic quantities of cash rather than churning out educated or worldly individuals. Can you pass a few tests? Can you (barely) read? Can you (barely) write? Well, you can take out a loan and go to school, son, because EVERYONE should get a college education.\n\nThe result of all this has been to muddy the waters that job recruiters swim through on a daily basis. Now that nearly every candidate has a degree \u2013 and those who do not are promptly discarded \u2013 the degrees themselves aren\u2019t worth anything. They\u2019re a requirement for consideration, to be sure, but they don\u2019t actually mean anything beyond that.\n\nTo put that another way: since all the candidates now possess a degree, the degrees themselves aren\u2019t proof of anything. Whereas Bill could flash that transcript in 1965 and Jim the recruiter instantly knew that Bill was a go-getter who had made it through a very narrowly-focused and rigorous education system (you know, back when every class required a term paper of 30 pages? \u2013 a clue that our standards have dropped: I wrote a grand total of ONE of these my entire undergraduate career at the top-ranked public university in New England), Jim\u2019s replacement has no idea that Barry, who has essentially the same degree Bill did, is any more of a sure choice than Nathan. To Jim\u2019s replacement, they\u2019re identical candidates in this regard \u2013 and since almost everybody not only gets into some kind of college or other, and those who have even the most modest abilities can graduate, Nathan and Barry\u2019s diplomas don\u2019t really mean what they should. By extension, the degrees don\u2019t really earn either man anything \u2013 they\u2019ve become, as I said, passcards.\n\nBut the lie in all this was one that Barry, and Nathan, and myself, and thousands of others were sold in high school: that our degrees were going to prove profoundly more powerful and useful than simply being a checkmark on a list of requirements for any given position.\n\nAnd the problem with the system that we\u2019ve built is that when the economy takes a downturn, people such as myself go from having very little hope, to having no hope in an instant. Young (but not for much longer), willing to learn, and (potentially) able to accept a reduced salary, we are nonetheless disregarded because we have no experience. But, with the floodwaters of debt closing in around our ankles, there is no higher ground for us to run to. We can\u2019t go back to school, we can\u2019t take out more loans, and we can\u2019t pay the loans that we have. Meanwhile, friends of mine who left high school and got practical careers \u2013 from jobs in the military, to basic positions in dental hygiene, to working as a receptionist \u2013 are generally doing fine. Not only do they have real-world experience to fall back on, they don\u2019t have the strangling fingers of hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of school bills wrapped around their necks, choking the life out of them. Sure, they don\u2019t make as much money as my parents or my wife\u2019s parents do, but they don\u2019t have any debt, either.\n\nIt is a tradeoff that I would merrily make in a heartbeat given the opportunity again. I would, whilst whistling Dixie, cast all my years of worthless schooling into a pit and burry it by the light of a blazing bonfire if I could dispense with the associated debt.\n\nMy wife and I talk about suicide. We speak about driving off the road into a tree and just ending it all. Regardless of how the economy turns, we aren\u2019t ever getting this time in our lives back. These days, weeks, months and years; supposedly the best of our lives, when we are young, and independent, and married without children \u2013 it\u2019s never coming back. It doesn\u2019t matter what happens in a decade \u2013 at that point, our youth will have been stolen away from us. It will not return.\n\nI hate the choices that I made. I hate that I decided to listen to people who I should not have lent an ear to, and I loathe that I gave into the hope of false promises and ridiculous stories of instant success. I blame nobody other than myself for these decisions; I own up to them whole-heartedly. But that doesn\u2019t mean that I can\u2019t, in turn, place a little blame on the system that stole away my twenties and is about to pilfer me of my thirties. I am at the bottom of a dark well, with my feet in the icy waters and a cold winter moon rising overhead. Not only are my cries being ignored, but the system that trapped me in here is cashing in on the certainty that I will fail to ever escape.\n\nThere are wolves on the doorstep. They hunger.

This post might be a bit lengthy, but here we go.\n\n(EDIT: I went way too far with this post. The first half is just talking about why my GPA sucks and me just generally whining about why life isn't fair)\n\nTo say I have had no idea what I've been doing in regards to getting into college  would be a VAST understatement. My obliviousness of the college admissions process over the last few year is staggering, and to be blunt, scares the living ***** out of me. Up until the end of last year, I figured I would get into pretty much whatever college I wanted. I didn't think my grades were too bad - usually a B without the 7 points my school adds for AP/IB and an A with -, my school-required standardized test scores (excluding the SAT, which  I hadn't taken yet) such as the CRCT, High School Graduating Test, etc were generally 95th-99th percentile, all of my classes were AP/IB or with with upperclassmen, etc. And so, life was good. And life continued to be good until the middle/end of last year when I decided to start looking at colleges and realized I was pretty much f****d. After spending weeks over the summer before my senior year researching the colleges admissions process, I finally realized I had done, quite literally, everything single possible thing in relation to getting into college wrong. Like EVERYTHING. I had taken the wrong classes, focused on the wrong subjects, disregarded any school or otherwise academically related extracurriculars, kept my grades high enough to the point where they were above average for a particular class (eventually sealing my fate, more on this later), etc. Essentially, my priorities were more twisted than a bag of pretzels. It horrifies me today thinking about how incredibly stupid I have been over the last couple of years.\n\nOK so here's the deal with my grades. Currently, I believe I have somewhere around a 3.1 or 3.2 UW GPA, and maybe a 3.7 or 3.8 W. This is primarily the result of 3 factors:\n\n-1) My school  is extremely competitive, and essentially achieves consistently high test scores by deflating the grades in many AP/IB classes to 'encourage' a student to work harder. During both Junior and the beginning of Senior year, I have had to work at least 3-4 hours a night just to maintain an 84UW/89W average. The amount of work I have for some classes is ridiculous, and in the majority of my IB HL's, the average test and quiz grades are well below failing. Because of these low test grades - which are scored in an obscenely stringent manner - the vast majority of my time is spent doing bullsh** essays, projects, etc to put more grades in the gradebook and hopefully even out the grades. This seemingly preposterous administrative method, however, seems to work as my school has some of the highest IB grades in the country (it's still bulls**t though). \"But, InsaneBadger, if everyone in IB had low grades, than couldn't colleges just look at your class ranking to determine that your 3.1/3.2UW is actually the product of hard work?\", you may be asking. Well, that is the TRULY wonderful part about my scenario. And by 'truly wonderful', I mean horribly awful and the biggest academic mistake (apart from not going to our \"IB-certified\" rival school, which is a joke) I have thus far made, which brings me to my next point...\n\n2) My classes. Such a wonderfully researched and well thought out plan I had when picking my classes. Before I continue, here are the fundamental differences between IB Diploma Program and the IB Certificate Program, for those who don't know. IB Diploma is predominantly for those who plan on taking all college-level (IB) classes junior and senior year. Pretty much your entire junior and senior year schedule is chosen end of sophomore year, with several standard level (SL) and 4 higher level classes completed by the time your graduate.\nIB Certificate, on the other hand, is for students who only want to take one or a couple of IB classes and instead of all IB. Most of these students only take 2 or 3 SL classes total; if they had planned to take anymore they probably would have just gone ahead and just done the entire IB Diploma program in the first place.\n\nUnfortunately, I was an idiot and decided against the IB Diploma program, as it seemed too class-restrictive (there was a particular AP class I wanted to take that you couldn't take if you were doing IB Diploma). This was a very stupid mistake for a number of reasons:\n\n1.  I wound up taking almost the exact same classes as the IB Diploma kids did anyway, save for 3 AP's instead of IB's. But why is that necessarily bad? Well mostly because an IB Diploma seal on your college application/transcript makes your chances of acceptance go up significantly. You don't get the seal if your doing IB Certificate. So essentially I'm taking the same classes without the same recognition.\n\n2. This was my biggest mistake: Referring back to my hypothetical question above regarding low IB grades and how it affects rank: Turns out, the IB Diploma kids also take a number of exclusive IB classes that IB Certificate kids can't. These Diploma-only classes, such as IB TOK, IB Math Studies, IB Communications, etc act as fluff grades to help balance out the other horrendous IB grades received in the GPA-killing IB classes earlier mentioned. And, of course, these same classes are the ones that I decided to take. Except I have nothing to balance them out with. Instead, my other classes are all AP's - not as hard as the IB's but definitely not a fluff grade. So while the IB Diploma kids' UW grades look a little something like: 81, 94, 80, 98, 75, 96, mine look a little more something like: 81, 88, 80, 89, 75, 87. I am the only one in my entire grade stupid enough to have chosen a schedule that is both more difficult and more time-consuming than the supposed \"crown-jewel' of academics (IB Diploma), and yet looks less prestigious on paper.\n\nSo that is part of the story behind how I have made nothing but misinformed, idiotic academic decisions since I entered high school.\n\n\nIdk why I just wrote all of that...\n\nAnywaysssss, on to my actual question. I will try to make this not quite as long.\n\nI have taken the SAT 3 times so far:\n- 2 at the end of last year\n- 1 this morning\n\nWhy I took the SAT the first two times I couldn't tell you. They were a complete an absolute waste of time, money, and opportunity. I didn't study for them, and I definitely didn't take them seriously. In fact, the first time I took it I was significantly hungover from the night before. But if you read anything I posted above, you will have realized I make pretty awful decisions when it comes to academics. PRIORITIES, INSANE BADGER, PRIORITIES! All I knew was that I had until December of my Senior year to take them and it wasn't a big deal if I did bad as I would just retake them. The first one I got a 1900, the second one a 1980. I should have canceled my score, but I had no idea that that was even an option. Like I said earlier, I've been oblivious to everything college-related. I don't remember the CR+M breakdowns.\n\nAnyways, it wasn't until about a month ago that I realized I only had one more shot at the SAT and I freaked. So I was just about to get to work studying when, of course, I am handed the largest set of assignments I have ever faced at one time in my life. This may sound like bs, but let me assure you, it is no joke. For the last 4 weeks I have worked AT LEAST and average of 7 hrs a night on homework, projects, essays, etc. Up until last week I had been pulling an all-nighter every 3 days or so. I don't think I got to bed earlier than 2 a single night last month. I wish I could say I was exaggerating, but unfortunately I am not. The largest assignment was due 4 days ago, and since then I have pretty much been in the clear. Except for 1 problem: I only had 3 days to study for my last shot at the SAT. Good news is my parents let me skip school for those 3 days and study at home - which I did.\n\nI have heard people say countless times that there is no way to substantially increase your SAT scores in such a small time period as 3 days. However, after spending 7 hours a day on SAT work for 3 days, I saw significant improvement. I tested myself cold-turkey beforehand and received a 670M + 670W + 650CR. This pretty much scared the crap out of me, as I knew I was capable of higher. And when I went back to check on what I missed in each section, I realized the majority of my errors were not from a lack comprehension, but rather errors of 'strategy'.\n\nMost of my math errors were nothing but careless mistakes - plugging in the wrong # into my calculator, misreading the question, stupid stuff. And so I worked on improving these careless mistakes for about 3 hrs, retook the math section and got a 730. Still not content, as my errors were once again careless, I continued to complete practice tests until my scores were consistently 740-800. For the most part I eliminated most of the careless mistakes, and usually missed or left blank 1 or 2 problems. There was only about 1 question every other test that I actually didn't know how to do or thought I knew how to do but did it wrong. The other 75% of mistakes were still careless errors, but whatever.\nSo next I worked on Critical Reading. My main problem with CR was vocab and over-interpreting the stories without textual evidence. I didn't get too far with vocab - I guess there's only so much you can learn in a day - but significantly improved on reading comprehension. At the end of the day I was able to consistently score around 720-740 on average, which I thought of as a great success considering.\n\nUnfortunately, I didn't get too far on writing the third day. On my 1980 SAT I had scored a 12 on my essay so I felt I didn't need to work on that part (boy was I wrong). I spent an hour or so going over grammatical rules for the Writing MC section, which I considered the toughest part of the SAT - and significantly improved on that as well. I then took a practice Writing section and assuming I scored an 11 on the essay, I received a 740. I only took this section once.\n\nI ended my final day of studying by taking an entire practice SAT and achieved similar results as those detailed above with a 2190. MY only problem at this point was time. I barely finished any section with enough time to go back over it, usually completing the last problem just as the timer ended. Also, all of these practice tests were directly from the CollegeBoard website (the free practice exam they offer every year), so I assume they should have reflected scores similar to those I should receive on the the real SAT.\n\nSo I woke up this morning ready to take the real thing, and was pretty confident with myself even though I had only studied for 3 days. I am just now realizing how much I've typed so I'll try to make this short. Essentially, I bombed it.\n\n- I should have written a practice essay or something because I absolutely flunked it this time around. Didn't even finish half of it. I got wayyyy to involved and descriptive, and just as I was finishing support for my 1st example the proctor gave alerted us we had 5 minutes remaining. I quickly ended my first example, and was a third way done with my second when the time was called. It literally just stops mid sentence.\n\n- I had similar problems the next 9 sections. Difficulty-wise, the real SAT was no harder than the practice ones I had taken. There was no math problems I couldn't solve, I just didn't get to them all. Writing and CR I can't be sure (since of course they are not math), but they did not seem any harder or give me any more trouble than the ones I had taken only days before. Nevertheless, I always had around 2 or 3 problems left to complete on each section by the time time was called. Some I just quickly filled in my best guess, others I left empty (which kills me).\n\nObviously, I will not find out my score for another couple of weeks. I really can't even guess. Regardless, I know for a fact I scored substantially lower than what I am capable of. I feel that if I had a month or so more to simply practice and increase my speed, I could realistically score somewhere around a 2200+.\n\nNow, here is the problem. The majority of the colleges I am applying to require either 2 SAT II's or an ACT with writing. I haven't taken the SAT II's yet, and planned on taking them in January (all colleges said I could send January SAT II's). But if I do this, then I cannot retake the SAT I - which I know for a fact I could do better on. My only possible option would be to take the ACT instead, and retake the SAT in January. But it would be my FOURTH time. How do colleges view this? I feel as if a college would find this excessive and look upon my score as if it took me 4 truly legitimate efforts to get there, when the first 2 I pretty much took as a joke. At the same time, I really need a high SAT score to somewhat counteract my terrible GPA. I realize a 2200 will in no way makeup for my 3.2U/3.7W GPA, but a 2200 it well above the average for an applicant to the schools I'm applying to and I think  it would probably help to some degree\n\nI also read on another thread about Score Choice, and how technically you could take the SAT 100 times without the college your applying to knowing.\n\nWhat does CC feel I should do?\n\nPS; I just realized how long this thread is. Just looked at the clock and it's been an hour. Holy ****.\n\nTL;DR-Took the SAT 3 times, know I can do significantly better. GPA sucks and I need a good SAT to help me out. What to do?

I'm assuming this is because it was a shorter test and I got more sleep. When I was taking the SAT, I began to feel very nauseous towards the end of the test. Also, I forgot my calculator, which was really stupid, and caused me to omit a few questions on the actual SAT.\nOn my PSAT I got a 280.\n67 in Critical Reading\n70 in Math\nand 71 in Writing\n\nHow can I boost my scores on the actual SAT? My ideal score range is 2200+, which I'm hoping is a feasible score. My worst section was passage based reading, which I found sort of odd because I always considered myself pretty good at that and I usually do really well on passage based reading on the AP Lang prep tests. I also have difficulty with those few random fill-in-the-blank questions that use very complicated vocabulary.\nI don't really want to have to study hundreds of words if possible, nor can I invest endless hours of time in preparation. Of course, I know boosting my score by that much will require time, so I am willing to do a lot in prep. What's the best program that has worked for you guys? Should I work on my biggest problems with a tutor? Thanks!

Please feel free to address your first- and second-choice major selections.\n\nAt USC, I want to major in Gerontology for the Health Science Track. This major is perfect for me because not only will it prepare me for medical school, but USC\u0092s Gerontology School is the oldest and largest in the country. When I started volunteering at El Encanto, sure, I liked biology. But when helping the nurses and seniors in that convalescent home, I started to gain an interest in the aging process. I began to wonder how the aging process worked, because when volunteering at the center, I would see the age differences between workers, volunteers, and nurses and the seniors. Then, I found out that USC had a gerontology program that would prepare me for medical school as well. So I visited USC, met Jim deVera and Maria Henke in the USC Davis School of Gerontology, and found out about some research that the professors did. I especially loved the research about the effects of fasting on the effectiveness of chemotherapy. So at USC, I would love to be a part of research like that. I feel that their gerontology program and research are perfect for me.\n\nVassar\nHOW DID YOU LEARN ABOUT VASSAR AND WHAT ASPECTS OF OUR COLLEGE DO YOU FIND APPEALING? 500 characters or upload document\n\nI learned about Vassar from my aunt; as the only one in the family to leave California for college, she told me of her experiences away from home. She knew Vassar because she went to Smith, part of the Seven Sisters. Living in a barely-known province in Rowland Heights, I wanted to go out of state, just like her.\nOne of the reasons I want to go to Vassar is its location. To me, New York is a symbol of freedom because it offers many opportunities to be independent from my mom who has raised me alone since second grade. I also love the setting of Vassar. When I looked at the online campus tour, I was entranced by how beautiful the school is. As someone who has always loved nature and adventure, I know I would enjoy living in Poughkeepsie surrounded by trees and right next to the Hudson River. (For the last several years I have been looking for a body of water nearby to play in with my friends, but could not find one. So living on a campus with the Hudson River running right through it is ideal!) In addition, I love how the school\u0092s buildings have reminiscent styles. I know I will love living in such buildings. Plus, with campus security, I can feel safe living there.\nIn addition, I like the education provided by Vassar. Vassar has small class sizes so that I will not have to feel too intimidated when participating in class. I find that it would be very hard if I had to raise my hand in a class with 100 students to ask my question. Sixty-Seven percent of Vassar\u0092s classes have fewer than 20 students, so I would find it much easier to develop a relationship with my professor. Also, I like how Vassar does not have a core curriculum. This kind of freedom appeals to me because it fosters broader thinking, which I believe can lead to new medical discoveries. On September 27, 1928, it was realistic to use antiseptics to treat wounds, even though it usually could do more harm than good. But the next day, Alexander Fleming accidentally discovered penicillin, and those antiseptics were outdated. As someone aspiring towards work in the medical field, I believe that something this monumental can be achieved with just a simple redefinition of what\u0092s possible.\nVassar is the perfect college for me because it is located in the beautiful Hudson Valley (which can provide me with many adventures) and its flexibility can bring me to the best of my capabilities.\n\nUniversity of Rochester\nIn 125 words or less, please answer the following questions.\nWhy Rochester? - The University of Rochester is one of two universities listed by The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching as arts-and-science focused, medium-sized, and highly residential, with comprehensive PhD programs, medical schools, and very high research activity. Both offer undergraduates an unusual degree of freedom in their curriculum. Which of these characteristics (or others) are leading you to apply to Rochester?\n\nI\u0092ve always wanted to travel to New York. It\u0092s actually on my bucket list of places-to-be. As someone who loves nature and adventure I love the fact that Rochester is right next to the Genesee River. (For the past several years my friends and I thoroughly explored our small town Rowland Heights, but unfortunately we still haven\u0092t found a body of water nearby enough to be our new favorite place.) Plus, I get to enjoy the suburb of the college with the option of a city life nearby. I also know I will be more comfortable in Rochester\u0092s small classes. This way, I can more easily build relationships with my professors and classmates. In addition, the Take Five Scholars program and no required subjects will let me broaden my interests and bring me to my fullest capability. I believe the broad thinking that these qualities foster can lead to many medical discoveries in the future.\n\nMeliora: ''Ever better'' - The University's motto directs our focus toward continual improvement through learning, discovery, creativity, and enterprising collaborations among people with different points of view. Describe a ''Meliora'' experience from your life.\n\nIn 8th grade, my principal told me my goal of a perfect 600 on the STAR tests was \u0093unrealistic.\u0094 Her remark disheartened me all day, but that year I proved her wrong. In middle school, I was just a mediocre student, but my 600 boosted my confidence. I resolved to try harder and challenge myself with the IB program. I knew that the only limits were those set by me. Because of my principal\u0092s comment, I realized I could do better, worked harder, and found more joy in learning. I still remember the words my principal said to me four years ago. But now that I think back, I know that I was, in fact, being realistic.\n\nJohns Hopkins\nWrite a brief essay (250 words maximum each question) in which you respond to the following questions. (freshman applicants only):\n1. Johns Hopkins offers 50 majors across the schools of Arts and Sciences and Engineering. On this application, we ask you to identify one or two that you might like to pursue here. Why did you choose the way you did? If you are undecided, why didn't you choose? (If any past courses or academic experiences influenced your decision, you may include them in your essay.)\n\nOf all the majors offered at Johns Hopkins, the two I would like to pursue the most are biology and pre-medicine. I want to major in biology, with a background in pre-medicine so that I can become a doctor. One reason I picked these majors is that in my biology classes at school (Honors in 9th, and IB in 11th), I have done well, and passed each semester with one of the highest grades in the class. I have always enjoyed biology as far as I can remember; even as a child I loved watching the animal channel or national geographic, and loved anything related to nature. As I grew older, this love expanded to include biology as learned in school, hence the biology part of my major. I feel that it\u0092s perfect that I love biology, a subject that goes hand in hand with the medicine field. As for why I picked pre-medicine, it probably has to do with how my parents divorced. My father has been physically and financially absent from my life for over the last decade, and even made a few threatening calls to my mom and I. At a young age, with my mom always busy working to support us, I was forced to become self-sufficient. As a result, I want to be someone who contributes to strengthening children and their families. I believe this has influenced my choice to pursue medicine. Being a family doctor helps to nurture children in their development and can ensure that parents are alive and well to take care of their children. I feel that being a doctor is the only profession that would allow me such direct access to both generations of a family. I am drawn to medicine as a helping field, one that connects people with doctors willing and able to provide the support, care, and the treatment they need. I look forward to a future where I may be a positive force in the strengthening of individuals, children, and families in my care.\n\n2. Tell us something about yourself or your interests that we wouldn't learn by looking at the rest of your application materials. (While you should still pay attention to sentence structure and grammar, your response is meant as a way for us to get to know you, rather than a formal essay.)\n\nI come from a tiny community called Rowland Heights. If you haven\u0092t heard of it, it\u0092s because the only thing that Rowland Heights is really known for is Bloomberg\u0092s naming it the #1 Place in CA to Raise Children. I can vouch for that; I absolutely love it here. I think something not everyone knows about me is that, even though on the surface people perceive me to be calm, composed, and studious, I am secretly an adventurer. Since I love to travel, but cannot afford the expense, my friends and I \u0093travel\u0094 on mini adventures all over Rowland Heights. As a result, we know where all the good food is. One of the things I love about home is that everywhere you turn there are Asian bakeries, sushi bars, buffets; basically there is food everywhere. My favorite place to be is Dolphin Bay, a boba shop on Colima Road. Many of my favorite memories have happened there and it\u0092s like a second home.\nI also have some guilty pleasures; I like letting my inner girly girl out watching America\u0092s Next Top Model (ANTM) and Glee - I have watched nearly all of the episodes for both. After a long day of school and tennis practice, my friend Athena (a fellow ANTM watcher) and I \u0093tooch\u0094 and \u0093smize\u0094 along with Tyra Banks and roll our eyes at the drama on the show. Amanda watches Glee with me, and we love to sing along with the new character Marley, whose voice is oh-so-heavenly. At Johns Hopkins, I am definitely looking forward to meeting new friends, starting with my roommate. Food scouting is also on the list! I hope that in the next four years I\u0092ll find our own version of Dolphin Bay-I\u0092ll create new memories and all the servers will know my \u0093usual.\u0094 Most of all, I am eager to find my independence!\n\nPepperdine\nPlease respond to the following question (50 words or less).\nIf you were to write a book about your life, what would be the title?\n\nThe title would be \u0093Intents and Purposes\u0094, inspired by this quote from the movie 500 Days of Summer. \u0093Height: average. Weight, average. Shoe size, slightly [below] average. For all intents and purposes - just another girl. Except she wasn\u0092t.\u0094 I feel like it describes me (and the movie\u0092s Summer) well.\n\nPlease respond to the following question (500 words or less):\nPepperdine University is a Christian university committed to the highest standards of academic excellence and Christian values, where students are strengthened for lives of purpose, service, and leadership. How are you prepared to contribute to Pepperdine's mission and community of faith, learning, and service?\n\nFor the past 7 years I have not gone to a stable church because whenever I finally settled in one, someone would discriminate against my mom about being a single mother. So she stopped going to church, and, she being my ride, so did I. I hope that at Pepperdine, where everyone in the church would be connected both by the school and by faith, I can be a part of a stable Christian family where I would not have to stop going to due to discrimination.\nAt Pepperdine, I hope to study biology on a pre-medicine track. Through high school, I have developed an interest in becoming a doctor. This is because of many reasons. One reason is that my father has been physically and financially absent from my life; therefore family values matter to me. I feel that being a doctor is the only profession that allows me direct access to the many generations of a family to help them. Another reason is that since I babysitted my younger cousins for many years, my love for them translated into a love for children in general, and want to help them in any way I can. This is why I want to study biology - so that I get a good foundation for my future career while studying a subject I love.\nSophomore year, my friend and I founded a service club in our school called Leo Club. Leo Club is the school club version of the world\u0092s largest international service club, Lions Club. By being the club\u0092s co-president, I learned the leadership skills necessary to gather and lead a group of people in Leo Club\u0092s mission of Leadership, Experience, and Opportunity: the club\u0092s acronym. I want to take my experience in my high school\u0092s Leo Club and expand on it in Pepperdine\u0092s campus. I am ready to lead and gather more people to help our community (perhaps through a Lions Club on campus.)\n\nPitzer\nPitzer College's educational foundation is built upon five core values: social responsibility, intercultural understanding, interdisciplinary learning, student engagement and environmental sustainability. Our students utilize these values to create solutions to our world's current and future challenges, both big and small. Keeping our core values in mind, please answer one of the following prompts (Maximum of 4000 characters).\n\n2. Tell us about an accomplishment of yours. How did you use one or more of our core values to reach your goal?\n\nOne accomplishment of mine is the Leo Club of Rowland High School, of which I have been co-founder and co-president for the last two years. Leo Club is the high school version of Lions Club, the world\u0092s largest international service club. Through this club, I became more engaged as a student. The first step in creating a club requires AAAAA amount of signatures from the student body. For this, I had to convince the students in my classes that our school could benefit from a Leo Club, and that this club was distinct from any other club on campus. This forced me to engage with the students in a less formal form of advocating speaking. Once Leo Club was approved, I then had to engage myself with the rest of the community. Leo Club started with small events such as a fundraising concert, a school clean up, and other community service events. Then, we engaged ourselves with more global issues such as North Korea\u0092s situation and the Operation Smile cause. Through being engaged with more than what directly influences me, I gained leadership skills and learned the joy of helping. It feels good to know that I have made an impact, whether small or large, in my community and my world. Sometimes I used to feel really insignificant in this world, there being 7 billion people and me being only one. But I realized that one seemingly small thing, me, can actually make an impact. Just like one dose of a cure can heal illness, one person can actually make a difference. And through engaging myself, I can confidently say that I do make a difference. In the future, I hope that my actions will benefit my world, even if that action is just prescribing medicine to a child.

Why two you ask? Because I messed up the first time and made it too long. Have fun reading this novel.\n\nI'm about to be a sophomore soon at a private Catholic high school which is one of the best or maybe even the best school where I live (which probably isn't saying much). It has the highest graduation rate, SAT test scores, etc. But I'm not happy here. It took me a year to realize that my freshman year summed up was me being fake and hanging out with the popular kids who I honestly feel no connection with. I hold myself back and don't do clubs because I feel I'll be judged by my friends. Everyone here's the rich white kid who gets whatever they want, whenever they want. And then there's me-- the Asian kid who should be rich but isn't but acts like she is and makes everyone believe she's cool when she's actually a loser deep down. This school, I feel, has changed me... for the worse. I have to pretend like I'm just like everyone else especially politically/religiously wise. I came up with this conclusion last night and have thought about it till now (I haven't fallen asleep yet... it's 6 AM). The people here have sexy looking houses and cars and I don't. I talked to my brother just now about this and he told me that this school will possibly help me get into a better college which will result in a better job which results in a high paying job, etc etc. And when I think of that, I think \"Hey ya know, maybe you should suck it up, act like you're one of them, and get by with a good education!\" And to be quite honest with you, I don't even really learn because I hardly pay attention in class and cram on tests that I forget about the day after.\n\nThe other solution would be to go to the public school near me. My parents wouldn't have to pay as much as they do for my education. It may be crappier education-wise, but doesn't it ultimately depend on the STUDENT? And if I work my ass off would it not amount to what I would have done at the private school? I'd also probably join clubs I'd actually like and do things I'd want to do because I've known these public school kids for years and they wouldn't judge me.\n\nTL;DR\nPrivate High School Pros:\n- 100% Graduation Rate\n- High SAT Score Avg\n- Highest AP Score Avg\n- Overall Better Education System\n- No one dresses like a loser\n- iPads instead of books\nPrivate High School Cons:\n- I'm unhappy (which I think is affecting (effecting?) my grades)\n- Changing my personality\n- Judgmental ******s\n- Won't join clubs because my friends would judge me\n- Don't feel a connection with my friends\n- Focus too much on fitting in\n- Becoming ashamed that I'm not as rich as them\n- Expensive\n\nPublic School Pros:\n- I'd feel more welcome\n- I'd hopefully have more fun\n- I know a lot of people there already\n- Not judgmental ******s\n- I'll join clubs I want to do\n- I'll be happy!

I basically started this thread to let everyone who wants to go to Notre Dame know what they're getting into, because although I get the feeling that the majority of people love it, there can be some issues. I've been here two months, I'm a freshman, so how well adjusted I am so far may change. Be that as it may, I'm fairly sure that I have a fairly good idea of life (so far) at ND.\n\nI'll start off with some pro's...\n\n(1)ND's academics are obviously superb, they were the reason I chose ND over BC. I'm a pre-med major and ND has sent about twice as many students to medical school in the past years as BC, despite a fairly comparable sized undergraduate student body. That and the fact that BC gave me over 6k less in financial aid sent me over to ND.\nAnyways so far my classes have been great, I'm also in the honors progam which does lead to some smaller classes with professors who can be amazing. My philosophy and humanities seminars for example have about a dozen kids in each. They are fairly writing intensive, but that depends both on the teacher you get as well as the class. My math class has about 40... and so does my elective (in which the teacher goes off on tangents most of the class, but the test is just on book vocab so it doesn't really matter). Intro Chem on the other hand is a class about half the freshman class ends up enrolled in, so its about 250 people per lecture, and can be fairly difficult if you're not a science person/havn't taken AP Chem.  Either way, if you got into ND and really work at it you should be fine. You do need to manage your time though.\n\nGoing along with academics the competition at ND is much less than what I hear exists at the Ivy Leagues or some other top tier schools. People aren't stealing notes, or out to sabotage your grade for the sake of the curve. This could be because (in my classes so far at least) there hasn't been a forced curve. I think it also helps that the dorm-comraderie overrides any seriously competitive tendencies, which I'll get to next. Overall, you can't go wrong with ND's academics.\n\n(2)Dorm-camaraderie... now this is a pro that has a seriously negative con to go along with it, single sex dorms. But I'll stick to the positives for now. You'll get to know the guys in your dorm, especially on your floor, very well. I'm in a quad and there's always people popping in and out to watch The Office or work on engineering or for whatever other reason. You also get to know a lot of the upperclassmen because there's no separation in what area they live. They're usually pretty cool about hooking you up with parties and dorm mates seem to stick with dorm mates and look out for their own. I've been at ND two months but I can easily tell how life long friendships are so easily formed here.\n\n(3) Tradition is obviously another aspect of ND that can be a draw, how big that draw is depends on the person. Everywhere you go it is evident that you're at someplace which is special. Whether its from looking up and seeing the golden dome or just looking across south quad there is a certain quality to it that seems like it will last forever. Now that I've said that.. to be honest the whole tradition thing is nice, but it doesn't make a college fun or any better at sports or academics, so that that at face value. If you're into the tradition and history then all the better ND will be for you, if you really don't care much (like me) it doesn't really matter.\n\n(4Football... the minds of many jump immediately to football when they heard the words \"Notre Dame.\" Although our season has been abysmal, the fans are still dedicated and the student section is still primed for cheering. Now to be honest, I'm not the best person to listen to when it comes to football, especially ND football. I love playing pick up with my friends but I didn't really follow football before coming and now that I'm hear I've only gotten a bit more into it (perhaps because of how horrendous we are). So I won't say much more about it because I'm not too knowledgeable and this season is unique in it's terrible-ness.\n\n(5)Other sports such as basketball and hockey are also big, but because their seasons havn't really started yet i won't spout off nonsense about what i have no idea. The same fans are still dedicated though so I'm assuming that the basketball season will be much better than the football. It should also be mentioned that Intramural sports are big at ND and many participate (I've actually joined a progam called bengal bouts, which culminates in a boxing tournament in the spring). Playing a sport isn't a necesitty though.\nAlrighty then, I\u0092m sure there are some other pro\u0092s but I\u0092ve gotten bored talking about them so onto the juicy stuff\u0085 I should preface that saying a lot of this is probably not true for everyone and it\u0092s just my opinion so please refrain from flaming, at least too much.\n\n\n(1)First.. the number one problem I\u0092ve had with ND are the girls. There, I\u0092ve said it as bluntly as I could, so sue me. If you\u0092re looking for attractive girls, ND is not the place for you. That doesn\u0092t mean there aren\u0092t attractive girls, because there are, and there are quite a few. But attractiveness and quantity are all relative. Because in comparison to other colleges ND is definitely lacking. I should also mention that I\u0092ve talked to other guys about this and they agree on those accounts regarding girls, so I\u0092m not alone. If you\u0092re a guy at ND, you\u0092re aware that the girls aren\u0092t great to say the least. There are a LOT of not attractive girls at ND. And when there are 4000 other guys also looking to\u0085 well either score or go out with or whatever, those same, limited in number, attractive girls, it becomes very tough.\n\nAnother thing I\u0092ve noticed (in my limited scope of judging guy attractiveness, I\u0092m a heterosexual male so keep that in mind) is that the guys seem to be considerably more attractive then the girls. This again makes it harder because of the quality competition for those few foxy ladies. The hook-up scene in general is also not exactly roaring, it happens, but it happens much more at other colleges.* This is probably a direct result of\u0085.\n\n(2)Parietals. Parietals suck. Don\u0092t listen to what people say about how it gives the dorms a time for bonding and a nice quiet time to relax and stuff. It does do that I suppose but the benefits of this far outweigh the sacrifice. There\u0092s the obvious result that it can be much more difficult to have girls over for the night because of the risk involved. Sure, people do it, it\u0092s not exactly rare to hear about breakings of parietals. But it does place a damper on things. And it\u0092s also not rare to hear about people being caught doing it, and getting into considerable trouble, it\u0092s not just a little slap on the wrist. There\u0092s also the result that on-campus parties end at 2, since they all take place in the (guys) dorms ( which also doesn\u0092t help the girl situation because having parties in guys\u0092 dorms naturally results in usually more guys at parties than girls.)\n\n(3) Single Sex dorms\u0085 a double edge sword. It can lead to better friendships with the guys in the dorm, but the sacrifice for this is terrible. It obviously makes it more work/harder to meet girls, because you don\u0092t live together. Going along with this, it has the result that if you\u0092re just chilling in the room, you\u0092ll basically just be seeing guys all day. There won\u0092t just be much casual hanging out with girls unless you have like a group of friends or some girl friends who you can hang out with. I never realized how much fun girls were just to hang out with until I was at ND for a couple months and then went home on fall break and saw some friends. ND pretty much wants to prevent hanging out with girls, which sucks.\n\n\n(4) The entire Catholic atmosphere of the school\u0085 I realize that for many this is huge plus as opposed to a con. But for me, a very non-religious person, it\u0092s a negative. They tell you there\u0092s no pressure to go to Church, and there\u0092s usually not, but there can be a bit of slight pressure everyone once in awhile. The Catholic atmosphere is also responsible for the parietals, pruder girls, and some pretty strict rules about other stuff. The one thing ND IS lax on is beer for the most part. As long as you don\u0092t walk around with it in the hallways or throw up you\u0092ll probably be fine.\n\n\n\nso.. take from that what you want to, it's just my perspective.

Since our existence we have discovered methods for the creation of fire, artificial light, television, and medicine. We have solved so many of our world's mysteries and secrets. But, has our knowledge taken us too far? Have we stepped into an age in which our advances and knowledge become burdensome? From global warming to robotic policies to our inflated ego to 'super bugs', human knowledge may be on the verge of becoming a burden.\n\nGlobal warming is a daily reminder of the consequences of our technologies, which are a direct product of our vast knowledge as a species. Greenhouse gas levels are increasing exponentially in our atmosphere resulting in the demise of species, destruction of ecosystems, loss of biodiversty, and even an increase in extreme weather. There is a definite correlation between increasing temperatures and extreme weather which is resulting in unbelievable destruction such as the destruction during Hurricane Katrina. A direct result of the internal combustion engine and the aggregation of greenhouse gas emitting energy sources, global warming is a burden due to our human knowledge and our advances in technology.\n\nIn 2005, the Korean government was faced with an interesting, yet disturbing dilemma. The advances in robotic technology in the extremely modern society called for \"Robot Policies\" to be drawn up to prevent future robots from being abused by their owners and vice versa. An estimate for their government suggests that robots may carry out surgery by the year 2035. These advancements, a amazing as they seem, are turning burdensome. Many policies, rules, and regulations are being formulated to keep everyone's rights in place.  Who would've thought the day would come when robots would need their own 'voices' to be heard! Studies say that robots may even become children's best friends after the mass production of domestic robots beings in the future.  This poses variegated ethical issues and poses to be a major issue in the future. Our human knowledge and mind has led to such a situation.\n\nThe human mind and knowledge results in our arrogance and callous attitude.  We, as a whole, think that we are head and shoulders above anything to ever set foot on our planet. This leads to less consideration to the devastation that we are causing across our planet.  We feel that if it isn't related to us, then it doesn't matter. This should not be the case. Our human knowledge has isolated us from the rest of the planet and has left a gaping hole in our place in the planet's natural system. Our knowledge of medicine and antibiotics has resulted in resistance bacteria known as super bugs. MRSA, along with other bugs are spreading throughout the globe posing a looming future threat.\n\nTherefore, human knowledge has now become burdensome.  it has created global, ethical, moral, and many other issues.  We have been given a gift. A gift that allows us to think about the future and find solutions to problems, but now it seems like we are doing much of the opposite. Our knowledge should be treated carefully. However, in the end, humans have always developed solutions to problems. So, let's hope that we can rid of these burdens by using our immense knowledge.\"\n\n\n\nSo, what do you think. Could you give me a score on the 1/12 scale? I am trying to figure out my score for my practice test. Any tips, advice or anything would be awesome! Thanks....oh and the part about the robot policies is true, I read about it in business class, but it was vague in my memory, so it kind of sounds unprofessional when I don't list the actual sources for the study and such. I just don't remember.

Thank you. :)\n\n\nShould we pay more attention to people who are older and more experienced than we are?\n\nThe importance of listening to elders may be a trie saying, but the basic concept is incrediblyuseful in our own lives. Although some people may argue that listening to oneself is more important than relying on other people\u0092s experiences, they do not realize that the information that elders may provide to us have their own experiences and lessons embedded inside. Two examples that exemplify this notion is the character of Pip in the novel Great Expectations and the short story \u0093Where Are You Going, Where Have You Been\u0094 by Oates.\nIn the story Great Expectations, Pip is a young child who starts off under the influence of Mrs. Gargery and Joe, two people who both care deeply for Pip. The result of listening to the wise Mrs. Gargery and Joe provides Pip with a solid upbringing by knowing the difference between right and wrong. As a result, Pip even provides food to a strange convict in the marshes, proving that his adherence to his family\u0092s teachings has improved his sense of empathy and kindness. However, when Pip arrives in the city and listens to the advice of Estella, a young girl whom Pip is infatuated with, he falls into sorrow and disappointment which contrasts sharply with his situation back when he was living with his family. Pip ends up spending \u0085\n\n[End of Page 1]\n\n\u0085 money recklessly and falling deeper and deeper in debt. The influence of his newly made friends, who are all less wise than his parents, serve as a negative influence on Pip\u0092s life.\nIn the short story \u0094Where Are You Going, Where Have You Been\u0094 by Oates, the young girl, Connie, is portrayed as a typical American teenager. She does not listen to any of her parents\u0092 advice and goes out with her friends every night to go to the local restaurant to hang out. As a result of her distaste of her mother\u0092s advice, she runs into Arnold Friend, a stranger who eventually stalks Connie and kills her. Before this incident, Connie\u0092s mother warned her to be more obedient and less superficial. Connie continued to flaunt her beauty, and as a result she fell victim to a killer. If she had only adhered to her mother\u0092s wise advice, she may not have attracted the attention of Arnold Friend, thus saving her life.\nIn the end, listening to people who are wiser results in far fewer stumbles and an easier path to success. If only more kids and teenagers realized this, there would be both a chance for teenagers to improve their lives and a chance for wiser elders to pass on their invaluable information to posterity.

Please, no private messages; I'm really really really busy...\n\nThe idea of describing the TASP experience is heretical. As I write these words, many other students around the world applying to live at the Telluride House at Cornell are also attempting to express what those six weeks meant to them. It is indeed a tragedy that they too will fail. As Antonin Artaud once wrote, ?To express it is to betray it.\ufffd?\n\nBut then again, not failing with a laughably grandiose 63-word response will do me absolutely no good in this case.\n\nThe idea behind the overly extravagant introductory paragraph is true: No given amount of writing would ever do our beloved program justice. It has been nearly a month since the ending of TASP, that dreadful day, August 5 and I am still struggling to recognize that ?TASP was the greatest experience of my life\ufffd? instead of ?Leaving TASP was the worst thing that has ever happened to me.\ufffd? I felt like Satan from Paradise Lost, ?hurled to bottomless perdition.\ufffd?\n\nIt took me several weeks to break out of this mindset, although I felt that one day at TASP was infinitely more meaningful than those weeks at home. Once I did this, I was able to appreciate TASP more fully and actually understand what it meant to me and how it has changed the way I perceive things in general. I remember reading the description of the program on the spam-like brochure that Telluride sent me. From this and several comments I found on the internet, I actually expected TASP to be a life-changing event. That said, TASP still exceeded every expectation of mine. It transcended every description on the brochure.\n\nStudents learn to form, and live responsibly within, an intellectual and social community.\n\nAs I was on my flight back to Springfield, I looked through the yearbook we had compiled at the culmination of our TASP. I could not hold back my tears as I reflected on all the journeys we had made together, small or large?whether it was our pilgrimage to 7-Eleven on July 11th to gather free slurpies or our epic odyssey to the downtown bookstore, which required us to master the Austin public transportation system, run frenziedly down streets, and flail our arms wildly at bus drivers. Yes, we were much more than ?an intellectual and social community.\ufffd? At the risk of sounding clich? and sentimental, we really became family to each other. I felt closer to the TASPers at the end of the 6th week than to friends I have known my entire life. For the first time in my life, I felt understood, appreciated, loved for who I am.\n\nSam, our factotum, asked me during the second week what I thought of TASP so far and what I wanted out of TASP. I told him that while the seminar itself was very interesting, I thought that what makes TASP so valuable are the many conversations about art, literature, politics, media,?life?that would make us think differently about ourselves and the world. I told him what Grace, a friend of mine who went to a different TASP, said to me once: ?I measure my life in memorable conversations like these.\ufffd? Indeed, TASP went beyond what I told Sam I wanted. In fact, I had some of the most interesting conversations of my life on the excruciatingly hot journey back to the house from seminar. Most of us thought the geography of our TASP quite damnable?we were living in a desert, and every morning we would have to walk twenty minutes to seminar and repeat after three hours of lecture and an elevation of 30 degrees. But in retrospect, this seemingly unfortunate problem of location was actually ideal for generating intellectual discourse. The walk was full of evaluating, praising, criticizing, complaining, joking, explaining?it was just intellectual paradise. The seminar never failed to humor us, spark our curiosity, or even anger us. We pondered over our responses to the professors? questions, the responses of the professors to our questions, and our responses to the professors? responses to our questions. Every day we thought and talked about the ?unanswered questions\ufffd? in our topic, like why there is no handwriting that goes strictly from right to left. Varun once had a flashbulb idea a moment right after seminar, and he jumped at me and sputtered furiously, ?Paul?I figured it out.\ufffd? He pulled out a sheet of paper and explained to me, ?See, you cannot see your writing as you move your hand from the right to left. Since the majority of the population was right-handed, they had to take this into account. Plus, your hand would smear the ink as it passes by.\ufffd? Weeks later, we heard a visiting professor, Dr. Mark Van Stone confirm this in a lecture, ?Some experts think that writing from right to left is not used because the hand would smear the ink.\ufffd?\n\nWe formed cohesive bonds, fueling each other?s love and intellectual curiosity. It is interesting how the two can be so related?that such an emotion could germinate merely from a series of conversations. It never occurred to me that conversations could actually promote such a deep understanding and sympathy for each other. TASP was very much a utopia?a truly ethereal experience. There was always someone who was willing to do anything with me, whether it was to go out for and talk about the history of constructivism in Russia, to watch Amadeus and gasp at the horrific sight of the white powder diffusing from Mozart?s corpse, or even to read The Penal Colony at midnight. A TASPer named Ferris even gave me company as I finished my paper in the wee hours of the morning, offering me encouragement and advice throughout the night to help me break out of my procrastinating ways and finish the damn thing while attempting to occupy himself by reading the Oresteia or staring blankly at the ceiling, patiently waiting for me to finish so that he could review it. We frequently walked together alone on the shortcuts to and from the sorority house like mavericks, refusing to take the longer, stupider route the others would take. We would boost our egos at having outwitted a bunch of people who didn?t even care, evaluate the efficiency of our daily travels, fantasize about using Austin Public Transportation to get to class, and solve the world?s problems in between. When I finally decided to use TASP as a golden opportunity to acquire a mohawk, as the environment was essentially a hiatus from social pressures, he accompanied me to the barber because I was frightened of the irreversible change. Tracy would take care of me and keep me in line?she too helped urge me to finish my papers, also helping to organize my messy pile of papers, books, and CDs. When Apple contacted me to say that they would not fix my iPod because of a very small dent, Varun spoke passionately on the phone for more than two hours to an increasingly irate representative. He failed. But what is significant about these anecdotes is how we eventually exhibited characteristics of a family.\n\nTASP is a story of how eighteen students from all over the world came to know and love each other, despite all the potential time for disagreements. In the real world (especially the Real World?), this does not happen?a group is bound to have its share of disagreements, hostilities, quarrels, disputes. But we didn?t. In my opinion, we were truly special. At the conclusion of the program we were almost inseparable. I felt like a baby being taken away from my mother. The house was like a luscious breast I had been suckling for six weeks, and I didn?t want it to end.1\n\nEach TASP encourages the students to use the seminar as a foundation for exploring ideas together, and the intellectual life of the program continues well after the seminar ends.\n\nThe truth in this statement cannot be underestimated. First of all, the seminar was ideal because of its overwhelming breadth. Therefore, everybody had something to add to the conversation?it did not require any of its participants to have a specialized knowledge of the history of writing. As I said before, class discussion never failed to stimulate deep thinking. We were asked to question whenever we could?even whatever the professors said. In fact, the professors themselves questioned each other. Frequently Professor Sue would stop Professor Kurt to question the validity of his statements or even to defend a student.\n\nThe class discussion actually began when the real one ended. People were especially conversational on the day before the papers were due?I told the professors that while they only saw the end product of our efforts, they missed much of the excitement: Each night before the due date, everyone would sit down together, collectively working on papers. Everyone would engage in lengthy discussions about the assignment. One would see people have revelations, bursting into frenzied jumps of joy. One would see people slowly disappearing from the computer room, finished with their papers, while their peers looked on jealously. Contrary to what I thought at the time, writing the papers was probably one of the most rewarding experiences of TASP. It was almost impossible to write a paper without thinking carefully about the prompts. However, the effects of writing these papers on my body were another matter. These are discussed in the second essay.\n\nTASPers are urged to take advantage of the resources of the college and university communities where the programs are held.\n\nMost of the TASPers took advantage of the recreational center. Some TASPers went there daily?there was a group of TASPers who went there every morning before seminar to run or swim. While I did enjoy going there to play the occasional game of basketball, ping-pong, or pool, the resources of particular interest to me were the libraries. I was the first one to explore them and also the only one to visit them frequently, as most of the others were reluctant to walk across campus. Indeed, the library was very far away but certainly not disappointing. I checked out a fair share of plays from the PCL Library, but what particularly attracted me was their Fine Arts Library. I returned frequently to listen to rare vinyl records and to check out some CDs from their rather large CD collection. The Museum of Art was also a very pleasant place to visit, especially its contemporary and modern art section.\n\nStudents attend specially arranged guest lectures and give speeches on topics that interest them?as well as join in informal dinner-table and late-night discussions of a great range of issues!\n\nI must say that I was somewhat bored with a few of the guest lectures. One involved a professor from the law department giving a three-hour analysis of the Constitution without stopping. Another professor from the physics department gave a somewhat tedious story of the birth of science, although the ensuing session for questions (which actually did not include any questions on the history of science but rather, on physics!) was fascinating, even though all of us were unable to comprehend the scientific language that he used. Two of the lectures were very illuminating, in my opinion. The professor who lectured on Hobbes made sure to use language that was easily understandable. He had asked us to read selections from Leviathan the night before, so we were able to engage in a very interesting conversation about the problems in logic that Leviathan depended on. However, the most rewarding lecture came from the professor who spoke about the value of a liberal arts education. Honestly, I had never thought about the purpose of education in a broad sense and was never able to justify the value of studying a topic that did not directly contribute to the well-being of others. Using Plato?s Cave metaphor, he emphasized the need for students to question what they have learned throughout their life and to independently think and form their view of critical questions such as, ?Why should I be moral?\ufffd? or ?Why is it good or not good to be selfish?\ufffd? Before we can evaluate artworks or laws, we must first understand the very definitions of art and justice themselves.\n\nI enjoyed the pubspeaks very much. Everyone was genuinely interested in their topics and this fact was very evident in their work. There were a couple of people who took the shortcut and simply read a paper they had written before. Their speeches were still very interesting, but in my opinion they missed out on opportunity to learn new things even about topics they are familiar with. I actually took a safer route and chose a topic that I was familiar with, but it still required me to research and formulate a structured speech. At first, the pubspeak really felt like a burden, but the end result was very satisfying. I spoke about the theoretical differences between Dada and Surrealism, and the eventual evolution of the former into the latter. I also read a Dada poem in the Dada tradition, complete with wild arm movements and shouting. I was actually shocked at how interested my audience was. At my own school, I would have been attacked for attempting to flaunt my intellect, but they asked very engaging questions. This was actually the first time I could fully understand how teachers could love their jobs.\n\nThe informal discussions, however, were the most rewarding experiences. To list the topics would be an impossible task. I had my fair share of serious, intellectual conversations?I spoke with Varun about the history of Guatemalan violence on the very first day of TASP; David and I discussed the significance of magical realist literature, comparing and analyzing the novels of Marquez and Allende; and Rachel and I talked about the ascension of the American underground in the 80?s and worshiped bands like the Replacements, Drive Like Jehu, and Nation of Ulysses. But I had a penchant for more unusual topics, which I am quite adept at broaching. Ed, Ferris, and I had a very deep conversation about why light sabers could not be fired at the Death Star from a distance, since they were able to pass through any substance; I conferred with King and Stephanie about the possibility of creating ?phallus.com\ufffd? and the rewards the domain might bring; and I told Jon about the how the discovery that epithelial cell tissue in foreskin can be grown very quickly could help humanity in many ways, such as serving as the principal material of parachutes, hats, or windbreakers. We also visualized a B-movie flick in which the growth of a foreskin sample suddenly becomes incontrollable, going rampant and ruthlessly devouring the inhabitants of the city.\n\nBut the conversations I am most fond of are the personal ones I had with various people, especially Sam. I frequently read out loud with Sam?originally out of pity for the guy, but eventually for myself. In between readings, we would have conversations about education, our futures, and our lives. I remember telling him the story about my conflict with my dad?how we never speak any more and how he will probably not help pay my college tuition. He sympathized with me, telling me of his own, almost identical situation and his solution. He also enjoyed telling me about his experience at Deep Springs and how it had affected him as a person, and how superior that experience was to any other part of his life. I told him how I became interested in art and literature. He explained to me how he became interested in political philosophy. It was truly through conversations like these that helped me to better understand who I am and what made me that way. In fact, at times I considered Sam to be more of a father figure to me than my own real one.\n\nStudents also attend group meetings and are responsible for planning community activities and discussing questions of self-government.\n\nOur house meetings never had enough problems. They were very orderly and everyone behaved very courteously. We also never had any instances in which there was a serious division in opinion that prevented a decision from being made. The only exception to this was in determining what article of clothing we would choose and what design would go on them. This seemed to drag on for weeks, until we forced ourselves to a decision. By this time, it was too late to receive the clothing by the end of TASP. Other than this slight inconvenience, we governed ourselves quite well and there were no problems in the meetings.

This assertion is accepted and repeated by a large group of people.\n\nThe obvious flaws in the methodology of the study, as well as its factual conflict with reliable data, are interesting to dig into, but to me, a more fundamental question arises:  Have people lost the ability to relate statistical assertions to their own very real lives so as to be able to detect even the most obvious BS?\n\nThe specific claim based on the study is this (\"DGU\" means \"defensive gun use\"):\n\n\nOkay, let's just mull that over for a minute.  1.3% of all American adults prevented at least one crime - last year - by brandishing, shooting, or referring to a gun.

And it's not the same 1.3% every year - while there's some overlap, the study results actually suggest that for the most part it's a new group doin' it each and every year (222/4799 yields 4.6% over five years, or a new .9% of the population engaging in DGU's each year).\n\nSo, my having been an adult for about forty years,  I should personally know a lot of people this has happened to.  40 X .9 = 36%!   Of course the population has turned over during that time period with old people dying and new people achieving adulthood, so if it was done just once per lifetime by each defender it'd be closer to 18%.  If we pump up the \"repeat defender\" rate by assuming that there are repeaters from one  5 year time span to another so we don't have to assume that 18% of all Americans engaged in DGU over that period of time we're still left with a substantial fraction of the population.  I mean, during that time there's probably a hundred people I've known really well - well enough so that if they had prevented an actual crime (and used a gun to do so) I'm confident that I'd know about it.  But I don't.  I actually don't know a single one.  I do know that people do prevent crimes, both with and without guns, and I've personally participated in crime prevention a couple of times.  (I've lived in some fairly high-crime areas.)  But actual \"crime prevented by gun-totin' civilian\"?  Absolutely zero first hand experience, zero reliable second hand experience.\n\nSo even without digging into the details of the study, it's not really too hard for me to figure that it really is a remarkable claim, which is inconsistent with my actual real life experience.  In short, my BS meter isn't just twitching - it's hit the peg.  And frankly - that was before I ran the numbers above - I just did that as a reality check.  They had me at \"2.5 million times a year.\"\n\nSo why do people just accept a claim like this?  I understand believing in UFO's - it's inherent in the belief that the ET's have the ability to prevent detection and proof, etc. - I mean, they're an advanced civilization, right?  And belief in conspiracies (which is necessary to believe the Kleck/Gertz study as well, by the way) similarly relies on a belief that someone is suppressing the \"real truth\".  But if people were actually preventing crime all the time - 120,000 time per month - we'd actually know about lots and lots of actual such events, involving people we actually know.  But we don't.  At best most of us have a \"friend of a friend\" that we've heard about, or read a story in the newspaper (since such events would typically be dramatic and newsworthy) But we don't actually have anywhere near the reliable personal information we should have if this claim were true.\n\nSo why do people believe stuff which doesn't even fit with their own very real lives?

As a dogma, it is perhaps the most important thing to understand when it comes to college admissions. But what does it really mean?\n\nWell, starting at a basic level, a university is not the buildings or the campus, but rather the people there, professors and students. Eh, I guess we can throw in admissions counselors too. When accepted, you are forming part of the university. It is not this great privilege you are receiving; you are simply a part of the university. But what does this really mean?\n\nLet's look at a single cell. You have your endoplasmic reticulum (English department), your ribosomes (Computer Science department), your vacuole (Philosophy department), etc. Each of these is composed of many proteins (people) all working together to form something great. Usually you would expect such an analogy to be made for the purpose of relating a fundamental characteristic of whatever is being discussed, but instead I am using it to illustrate what I don't mean. First, why would you want to be a protein in this cell? It would be completely unrewarding - you are simply part of a whole, and nothing more, not of any individual importance, for no one cares about a protein but with respect to what it does in the cell. Second, why is the whole so dependent on the parts? Would not a university continue to exist without the existence of an English department? Yet a cell would certainly fail without an endoplasmic reticulum. (interestingly enough, a university would fail without the existence of endoplasmic reticulums, and a cell would be perfectly fine without an English department  So, I have tackled one extreme of misconception of what it means to be part of a university. It is not a selfless act of contribution of your awesomeness (and money), as much as admissions counselors would love to believe this is your motivation for applying to Chicago.\n\nAlso, however, it is not merely an opportunity for you to serve as a leech in the college community to advance yourself. You are not trying to deceive the admissions officers in order to gain access to this great supply of knowledge. As much as students would love to believe that by drinking the sacred milk of Chicago they will become great, it's simply not the case, for it is the people that make the university, not the university that makes the people.\n\nOkay, now to get to the main point: it really doesn't matter what university you end up going to. There is this idea that if you get into University of Chicago, you will suddenly become the type of person who would be an intellectual at heart, the kind who has a shot at a Nobel prize. If you go to Yale, you will be a leader. If you go to your local community college, you will end up as a store manager living a miserable existence, hated by all those under him, and disrespected by all those above him, peerless, lonely, until one day he finds true love in a place so unexpected: the dry cleaners. Finding Beatrice changes him: she is a devout catholic and he soon finds God pulsing through his veins - veins of vengeance, for there was corruption in the company, and now he is finally going to clean it up. With guns, lots of guns. But it's not like that at all.\n\nAll college professors are horrible teachers. This is true across the board. They are very knowledgeable, yes, but teachers they are not. They will profess to you what they know, but you have to put it together yourself and make what you can of it. At the end of four years, the changed person you are will not be the result of the University shaping you, but from you using the University to shape yourself. While some tools may be more refined and others more crude, the chisel used by Michelangelo is no better a tool to use than any other.\n\nNow, we can explore yet another facet of \"the people make the university.\" What appeals to you about Chicago? Sure, the architecture is sexy, and the core curriculum is a balanced way to pursue your education, but when it comes down to it, it is all the great people associated with the University that gives it its appeal. These great people draw more great people into the university with time, and the whole thing builds upon itself until the university seemingly becomes greater than the sum of the Nobel prize winners - it becomes a Nobel prize-winner factory in the minds of applicants. But it is not, and this is the other half of the leeching coin. The University has no desire to pick you up off the street and shape you into a great person. Not only would that be incredibly difficult, but it would be incredibly, incredibly, incredibly difficult. They are looking for people who have the drive already to become great themselves, and then all they must do is provide the tools - the buildings, the libraries, the professors, and the scalpels for brain modifications. They are looking to admit people who will draw more people to the university.\n\nI think this should make it incredibly clear what is and isn't important to admissions officers. Community service, while commendable, is not important if you are doing it begrudgingly. Let's put it this way: would you want to be around people who do community service for many hours for an ulterior purpose? Well, kind of - you'd like the cleaner parks and contented homeless people, but wouldn't you much rather have people who will talk to you about philosophy at 2am? Who will be enthusiastic about the things you are interested in? Who will be as dedicated to a club as you are? Who will love you unconditionally? Who will do something amazing? Who are absorbing knowledge like a sponge and then using it to form their own ideas about the world, ideas that may change it? Or would you rather be with the people who want to get a degree from a prestigious university so they can make more money?\n\nThat being said, the process of forming yourself can start a little late for some people. Perhaps you didn't fully realize your love of knowledge until senior year of high school, so your GPA does not reflect the level of dedication you truly have. Perhaps you are incredibly stupid, and hence your SAT scores are not quite what you would have hoped. Well, you may want to get an idea of how appealing your new-found self is in the context of the self that is portrayed by your grades and scores. So, what do you look to? The statistics, of course!!!\n\nHere we are: University of Chicago College Admissions | Incoming Class Profile\n\nOkay, so I am male: 49% were male.\nI went to a public school: 66% went to a public school\nI have a 1560 (out of 1600) SAT: 37% had 1500-1600\nI am white: 42% were white\n\nWhat do we do with these numbers? Well, we are trying to find the probability that they all occur concurrently. 0.49 x 0.66 x 0.37 x 0.42 = 0.05025636 = 5%. Wow, that's pretty bad compared to the average admission rate of 28%. I shouldn't even bother apply, right? Right?!??!\n\nWell, no, because the number I came up with is not even close to my actual probability of being admitted, but this is the type of thing most people do when they look at statistics like this. No, they don't actually calculate anything like this, but they see a statistic like \"Only 8% weren't in the top 15% of their high school class.\" and then assume that that means their chance of admission based on that statistic is 8%. Unfortunately, most people don't understand the statistics enough to draw any reasonable conclusions about their actual chances of being admitted. So, how would we actually calculate it?\n\nWell, you need more statistics than University of Chicago provides on their website. First, you need statistics not only for those admitted, but for those who applied. (Actually Chicago's website has neither - only the statistics for the incoming class). Let's do a theoretical example:\n\nFake Statistics:\n1/4 of applicants had an SAT from 1500-1600\n1/3 of those admitted had an SAT from 1500-1600\n1/3 of applicants were in the top 15% of their class\n2/3 of those admitted were in the top 15% of their class\n1/3 of applicants were admitted\n1/1 of those admitted were admitted\n\nNow, what we can form are ratios of admitted to applied. For example, if 1/2 of all the applicants were human, but 1/1 of those admitted were human, then the admitted-applied ratio for humans would be (1/1)/(1/2) or 2. This means by being human, you are two times more likely to be admitted than the typical applicant. The ratio for non-humans would be (0/1)/(1/2) or 0, which would mean by being non-human you are 0 times as likely to be admitted. Sorry! So, the ratios for our fake statistics are:\n\nSAT 1500-1600: (1/3)/(1/4) = 4/3\nTop 15% of Class:  (2/3)/(1/3) = 2\nAdmission in General: (1/3)/(1/1) = 1/3\n\nSo, by having an SAT from 1500-1600 and being in the top 15% of your class, you would be 8/3 as likely as the typical applicant to be admitted. You simply multiply all the ratios together. Since the admission rate in general is 1/3, your overall chance would be 8/9, or about 88%. This is about as close as you could get for a good predictor of your chances with easy math and no actual data. Or is it?\n\nWhat is the problem with the method? Well, this calculation assumes that the factors are independent. In other words, it assumes that your SAT scores are your ranking are completely unrelated. In truth those with a higher SAT score are also likely to be ranked higher in their class. What does this mean? Well, it means that this 88% is a high number. For example, say there were 100 different tests exactly like the SAT that everyone had to take for college admission. For SAT-1, the admitted-applied ratio would be 4/3, and same with SAT-2, SAT-3, SAT-4, etc. so the combined ratio for all of these would end up being (4/3)^100, or about 3,117,982,410,208. In reality, you wouldn't have THAT much more of a chance of being admitted than the average applicant. :)\n\nSo, either you do some really awful math, get the actual data and compile your own statistics, or you change the simple calculations a little bit to give a more accurate probability. To compile the statistics on your own, you would just look at the ratio of those in the applicant pool to those admitted pool who shared all your characteristics, of course, we don't have the data, unfortunately. So...\n\nYou should only look at one factor at a time.\n\nThe SAT ratio is 4/3, so then according to that, 44% chance of being admitted.\nThe Rank ratio is 2, so according to that, I have a 66% chance of being admitted.\n\nNow I have 2 numbers: 44% and 66%\n\nI can't say for sure which number is closer to the actual probability, but I can be certain that it lies somewhere around those numbers. If you wish, you can take the average, so I'd say 55%. So, if you want a quick number that is more accurate than looking at the numbers without understanding them at all:\n\n(Total Admission Rate) * (Number of Admitted with Characteristic) / (Number of Applicants with Characteristic)\n\nSo, for that person worried about not being in the top 15%, while only 8% of those admitted weren't in the top 15%, if only 4% who applied weren't in the top 15% of their class, then with an overall admission rate of 28%, an applicant not in the top 15% of the class would have a 56% chance of getting in! Pretty good, eh? Well, it would be. Unfortunately, University of Chicago doesn't provide statistics for the applicants, so there is really no way to get a meaningful number after all.\n\nWhat was the point of all this talk of statistics then? Well, do you want to think about the statistics of college admission after reading all of that? I didn't think so. That it my point - the statistics will not help you at all. As long as you are true to yourself in your application and work to shape yourself with whatever tools you have, you will do well in life, no matter what happens. The best thing you can do is stop worrying about college in this senior year and start enjoying it, because this is the last time you'll see many of your friends. It is not the admissions officers deciding your future, believe me, it is yourself.\n\nStop trying to use numbers to measure yourself, because if you go for the numbers, you'll miss the bigger picture. When you are 60 years old and realize that you have done nothing for the world but used it, you will look upon your SAT scores, your GPA in high school and college, and your salary with contempt, for they will have taken away true self-actualization.\n\nNow, I need to go to my school with two large lenses and do something awesome to help out the performance of Macbeth.

WE NEED THIS THREAD TO BE STICKIED! Half the posts on this sub-forum ask about review books. So here's a summary for the aforementioned thread: (Note: we still have no recommendations from actual test-takers for German, German with Listening, Modern Hebrew, Italian, or Japanese with Listening mostly because not a lot of review books are out there for languages. Some that are available have been mentioned)\n\n\n\n- Kaplan (C, F, G, H)\nThe review sections are generally superfluous (unless you need a review of literary terms), but the practice tests are great, though they are slightly more difficult than the actual test in that they use more esoteric words (hey, better overprepared than under, right?). For best results, you may want to use it with the Princeton Review book (see below).\nReviewer\u0092s score: 780.\n\n- Princeton Review (A, C, G)\nI felt that their practice tests were more similar to the actual test than Kaplan's, though their review sections are similarly redundant. Quantity, however, seems to matter over quality, so if you must choose either PR or Kaplan, I would go with Kaplan.\nReviewer\u0092s score: 780.\n\n- Barron\u0092s (B, C, F, G, H)\nVery comprehensive and complete. It contains everything you could possibly look for in a prep book, including excellent explanations and practice questions. Goes above and beyond the necessary material (it even contains an essay-writing section).\n\nU.S. History:\n\n- Sparknotes Review Book with 3 Online Tests (A,C,D)\nGreat for last week review and refresh.\nRecommender's score: 790.\n\n- Princeton Review (AP) (G)\nGreat prep for the SAT II (some identical questions!)\n\n- Kaplan (A, B, C, D, E, F, G)\nRecommender 1: Read it cover to cover a week before the exam and felt really prepared. It really helps for stuff you didn't cover in class.\nRecommender 1's score: 790.\nRecommender 2: I wasn't in APUSH, and my class started with Civil War onward, so I had not learned a good 30% of what was on the test. I read Kaplan cover to cover and did 2 or 3 of the practice tests. The tests were slightly harder but left me extremely prepared. The chapters were concise and great for only teaching you what you need to know.\nRecommender 2's score: 790\n\n- AMSCO (AP) (B, C, E)\nIt is the most conversational textbook-ish thing I've ever read. Amazing at reviewing material. The practice tests are helpful for review, even though they are AP practice tests. Note: The recommender for this book is the same as the one for the Barron's book.\nRecommender's score: 800.\n\n- Barron's (F+, H)\nThis book is MUCH harder than the real thing, and the recommender got 30-40 mistakes on each practice test despite getting an 800 for the actual test. Use if if you want to be very well prepared, but do not fret over a bad score, because it is highly inaccurate. Note: The recommender for this book is the same as the one for the AMSCO book.\nRecommender's score: 800.\nditto above. on average 40-45 mistakes despite scoring high on the actual test. There is no scale for the tests, but there was a lot of overlap on the may exam.\nRecommender\u0092s score: 770\n\nWorld History:\n\n- Princeton Review (A, B, C, G)\nThis book is awesome because it covers everything in a comprehensive, easy to read, and cohesive review.\nRecommender's score: 800.\n\n- Barron\u0092s (AP) ( B, C)\nIf you're taking AP, just get this book and use it to study for AP and SAT II. It's VERY detailed, so start studying at least a month in advance. Very comprehensive, excellent text.\n\nMathematics Level 1:\n\n- Princeton Review (C, D, E )\nCovers everything for this test, and is easy to read.\n\nMathematics Level 2:\n\n- Barron's (E, F+) Rec 2: (F+, H)\nAlmost everyone uses it and my teacher recommends it, even though it's COMPLETELY unrealistic (because it's a lot harder). But, because it's so much harder, it prepares you wonderfully, and the real thing is a breeze.\nRecommender 2's comment: Very much harder than the real thing, but with 8 practice tests.\nRecommender 2's score: 800.\nRecommender 3's comment: Ignore the diagnostic test, it's crazy. As for the 8 practices tests, I think they're really good(althoug harder than the real thing) if you want to get an 800 for sure.\nRecommender 3's score: 800\n\n- SAT II Math for Dummies (A, B, C, D)\nI'm a good math student so I didn't feel the need to review much or research the best book. This book helped clear up a few miscellaneous topics (probability, sets, unions, etc.) that showed up on the real test.\n\n- McGraw Hill (A, H)\nI didn't use the McGraw Hill for studying. I used Barron's for all my studying...McGraw Hill for practice tests because i finished all the practice tests in Barron's. Tests are pretty accurate. I usually skipped two or less but on the real test I skipped 3.\nRecommender\u0092s score: 800.\n\nBiology E:\n\n- Princeton Review (A, B, C, D)\nTwo of my friends used this book and said it was great. Both got 800s.\n\n- Barron\u0092s (C, D, E, F+)\nThe fact that it was so hard, scared me, but made the real test seem like a walk in the park.\nRecommender\u0092s score: 800\n\nI quote, \u0093I studied this book for like a day and I got an 800. The Barron\u0092s book is so hard, but it made the test so much easier. I wanna go take a real test to prove to myself that I know Bio.\u0094\nRecommender\u0092s score: 800\nnote: the recommender actually spent around 10 days carrying around the Barron\u0092s book and studying in various nooks and crannies. Not to mention the hours she must have spent studying at home.\n\nBiology M:\n\n- Princeton Review (A, C, D) Rec 2: (B, C, D, F, G) Rec 3: (A, B, C, D)\nTwo of my friends used this book and said it was great. Both got 800s.\nnote: all PR editions are identical from 2006-2010. (don\u0092t worry I checked.)\n\n-Sparknotes (well organized. none of the other letters apply)\nIt was well organized by topic which was nice. Some errors included, but you\u0092re on your own for that one. Would not recommend.\nRecommender\u0092s score: (730, 760)\n\nChemistry:\n\n- Barron's (B, E) Rec 2: (A, C) Rec 3: (B, F, G)\n1: The practice tests are nothing like the real thing, but the book is still a good review of EVERYTHING in high school chem.\n2: Some extra information, but not too much.\nRecommender's score: 800.\n3: There was some unnecessary information, but it's fairly well done. I did a few practice tests and skimmed the topics that were confusing or unfamiliar to me. For me, the T/T/CE section was the hardest, but this book had questions that prepared me for the test very well.\nRecommender\u0092s score: 790.\nRecommender\u0092s score: 770\n\n- Princeton Review (A, B, G) Rec 2: (B, C) Rec 3: (A C D)\nRecommender's score: 770.\nRecommender 2's comment: Lacks some information, and is extremely brief and easy. However, it's good to use to learn material you don't know. The third practice test contains a lot of material that was not covered by the book, and is thus very difficult. This book isn't enough for someone who wants to get an 800.\nRecommender 2's score: 760.\nRecommender 3's Comments:Overall, the Princeton Review was a great book to brush up on Chemistry. It is a great book to familiarize yourself with the SAT Chemistry format, and it provides accurate practice tests for the real subject test. I would recommend this book if you are comfortable with Chemistry, but you need a little more practice to improve your score. A lot of people say the Princeton Review isn't enough to get a perfect score, but I believe as long as you understand the material, The Princeton Review can help significantly.\nRecommender 3 score: 800\n\nKaplan (A, B, C, D, F, G)\nThe Kaplan books seem to get a bit of a bad rap, and I'm not entirely sure why. I did 3 Kaplan tests, read through a few chapters, and no other studying, and I was really prepared.\nRecommender's Score: 780\n\nPhysics:\n\n- Barron's (A, B, C, D)\nPractice tests were somewhat different from the actual, but in general still good preparation. Little superfluous material, however preparation in some parts is on the scarce side.\n\n\n- Kaplan (B, C)\nGood for acquiring a general knowledge of previously unknown material, however the Princeton Review book is required for more in-depth knowledge. Practice tests are much easier than the real thing.\n\n- Princeton Review (A)\nExplanation of concepts is hard to understand, but practice tests are extremely accurate, although there aren't many of them.\n\n\nChinese with Listening:\n\nSat II Vol 2 W/ CD (Chinese Edition) (F)\nRecommender 1: Only SAT Chinese book out there. Written by the College Board.\nAmazon.com: Sat II Vol 2 W/ CD (Chinese Edition): College Board: Books\nRecommender 2: This is harder than the actual test. i usually get 4-5 wrong in the practice test, but i got one wrong in the real test and got 800 (im not even native speaker) in actual test, there is ALWAY ONE TRICKY QUESTION. i asked my chinese friends and even they didnt know the answer.....lol This book is both in english and chinese. Directions are written in english, just like the real sat test, and the questions are in chinese, of course.\nRecommender 2's score: 800.\n\nFrench:\n\n- Princeton Review (A, B, C, D, G)\nThe French exam is very centered on grammar, so a lot of the book is focused on that, which makes it a bit dull and boring. However, the practice tests were extremely accurate.\nRecommender's score: 760 (but on the listening exam...)\n-REA\nREA has a really good book for SAT French. It has some really good grammar explanations and its practice tests are pretty accurate.\nRecommender\u0092s score: 750\n\nFrench with Listening:\n\n- Princeton Review (A, C, G)\nThe book includes a very short and unhelpful section for students who will take the listening exam, but at least they tried. The book is good for the reading-based portion of the exam.\nRecommender's score: 760.\n\n- Barron's (B, C)\nThis book includes a CD for the listening section, however it has its drawbacks. The same people were used for all the clips on the CD, which is bad because you get used to their voices. This could make you have to strain to listen to the people for the real test. It's better than nothing, though.\nRecommender's score: 760.\n\nGerman:\nAmazon.com: SAT Subject Test: German (REA) -- The Best Test Prep for the SAT (9780738601601): M. Busges, F. Curry, J. V. McMahon, Linda Thomas, Peter Schroeck PhD: Books REA is available for German. no recommendations on amazon though. However, it's extremely expensive on amazon, so look on ebay.\n\n\n\n- Barron's (A, C, D, H)\nSlightly inaccurate practice tests, but the fact that there are many of them compensates for this.\n\n- Kaplan (B+, E, G)\nThe book is extremely organized and in-depth so it is more for learning rather than for reviewing. Regardless, it gives in-depth lessons and explanation of grammatical rules (very important in Spanish). Tons of great practice questions, as well as a great diagnostic test. My score went from a 650 to a 740 with this book.\nRecommender's score: 740.\n\nSpanish with Listening:\n\n- Barron's (A, C, D)\nSee comments for Spanish without listening.\n\nModern Hebrew:\nAmazon.com: SAT ll Subject Test in Hebrew (Modern) (SAT Subject Test Series) (9780837363073): Jack Rudman: Books this is the only one specific to the Subject test that I found while searching.

I may return again as a counselor this summer as well. I have added a brief summary and summary of important updates, some Ross related questions I answered in the past year and then added last year\u0092s post. The original post was from 2 years ago with occasional updates throughout the post, updates from last year are denoted by [NEW11:____], and updates from this year [NEW12:____]. Sorry for the messiness and repetitiveness of the post; I\u0092ve been asked similar questions many numbers. I am also very happy to answer any other Ross related questions you may have either in this thread or through personal message. The Ross FAQ is also very good The Ross Mathematics Summer Program for high school students, held on The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio. All text not in quotes is by me. I will also cross-post this on AoPS.\n\nSummary: Ross is an intensive six-week math camp that focuses on number theory. Students attend 8 hours of classes per week and other than for occasional events the rest of the time is unstructured. However, as the Ross website states \u0093students are expected to spend most of their waking hours, working on the mathematical problem sets\u0094 and this is meant quite seriously. Students who do not spend enough time on math are liable to suffer the wrath of the counselors.\n\nSummary of important updates: The change to six weeks from eight has been significant. Some material was cut and standards of rigor (previously they were excessive in my opinion) at the beginning of camp were somewhat lessened but there has also been a small increase in the pace of the program. The condition of the dorm has somewhat improved. The food situation appears to be somewhat in flux. Last summer, we were initially forced to eat in one (in my opinion horrible) dining hall. After the students and counselors complained we were allowed to eat at the many (and much better) campus eateries. Eventually, they gave us meal cards that were accepted at both on-campus locations and some off-campus restaurants (although first-years are required to be with a counselor when off campus).\n\nSection II: New Stuff since last year\u0092s post\n\nI answered some question in the responses last year\u0092s post http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/summer-programs/1262763-semi-definitive-ross-updated.html.\n\n\nBy the end, most students will be working on problems related to one or two threads and sampling problems from other threads. This is normally accidental, but students generally gravitate towards to some topics over others. Of course, some boss students will complete most of the problems on each problem sets, although this is normally rare.\n\n\nI'm not entirely sure how hard to get in. You need to show some mathematical ability but don't need to be a mathematical superstar or anything. What is important is your potential to learn math not what you already know. I believe the application quiz is the most important part of the application. I think something like 40% of applicants were accepted last year. That doesn't mean much though without knowing the strength of the applicant pool though and unfortunately I don't think anyone on CC knows that. I don't think any time is too early to apply as long as you've spent enough time on the application problems. If you have other questions I'd be happy to answer them as well.\n\n\nYou can definitely reapply if you have been rejected before. I'm not entirely sure about the last two. I think you would probably be able to defer your acceptance although you would have to talk the people who actually run the program. At the very least I can't imagine they would not allow you to reapply in future years.\n\nThe thread \u0093Summer Program Ranking\u0094 generated some interesting discussion http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/summer-programs/803562-summer-programs-ranking.html?highlight=ross\n\nAlthough this entire exercise is silly, it is important to note that prestige varies dramatically based on what criteria you use. For example among the 4 major math national camps Ross, PROMYS, Hampshire, and Mathcamp, Ross is by far the oldest and most established. PROMYS and some other lesser known camps are derivatives of Ross. I'm also under the impression that Ross does much better than the other camps among grant giving organizations because it is much cheaper than the other programs and I don't think this difference is attributable to differences in operating costs. Among all these metrics Mathcamp places last among these 4 camps. Yet Mathcamp is the most selective of all the camps despite being either the largest or close to the largest. This suggests that the high school students think more highly of Mathcamp and more established institutions think more highly of Ross.\n\n\nI guess I don't know for sure but Ross was founded in 1957 and Mathcamp was founded in 1993 and so Ross has had a lot more time to gain institutional prestige. I'm pretty sure though that Ross gets more outside funding than Mathcamp because Ross charges $2200 for six weeks and Mathcamp charges $4000 for five weeks and I don't think other differences can possibly explain that discrepancy.\n\nFrom \u0093PROMYS/Ross 12\u0094 http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/summer-programs/1303461-promys-ross-2012-a.html?highlight=ross\n\n\nI think camp life is pretty good. I've made a number of close friends there and I found the vast majority of people to be nice. I'm somewhat biased because I'll be a counselor this year but I think the vast majority of counselors and teachers are pretty good. Out of more than twenty counselors in the past two years there is only one that could be considered bad. There is no bed time. Students can and do stay up until all hours of the night and nobody has any problems with it.\n\n[NEW12: I want to emphasize that despite spending most of your time working alone at math it is still possible to form close friends. There are a couple of Ross people I probably talk to online a couple of times a week and many more I still keep in touch with and this is not atypical. Also, I should qualify my statements about bedtimes. Nobody will care when you go to bed as long as you attend lecture in the morning. If you routinely oversleep lecture the counselors will give you curfew (essentially a bedtime).]\n\nFrom the thread \u0093Mathcamp\u0094 http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/summer-programs/1310422-mathcamp.html?highlight=ross\n\nI think Ross is similar in selectivity to Hampshire and PROMYS. While USA/Canada MathCamp may be the most selective the differences between the camps are large enough that you should go to the camp that fits you best. Working mainly by yourself on number theory at Ross is very different from the myriad of activities both math related and not math related at USA/Canada MathCamp. I'm not sure that I'd agree with MathCamp being the most respected math camp for high school students. Ross costs $2200 for six weeks which just goes towards room and board. MathCamp costs $4000 for five weeks. The only reason I can think of for Ross being so much cheaper than MathCamp is that while Ross receives lots of outside grants, MathCamp receives considerably less. This suggest that at least among grant-awarding institutions Ross is more well regarded. Ross is also much older and has spawned many other math camps like PROMYS which suggests that Ross has a greater influence in mathematical circles. The reason Ross is less selective is probably not because it is less prestigious but because it is considered to be less fun. MathCamp allows you to bring computers, go off campus without a counselor, organizes lots of field trips and other activities . At Ross you do math, more math, and even more math with only occasional other activities [typically no more than 1 frisbee game and 1 other activity per week]. If you want to math pretty much all day long every day than Ross is the place for you. If you're not interested in such an intense experience then check out the other camps.\n\n\nI'm not sure why the fact the people choose MathCamp over Ross shows it's more prestigious. As I said in my last post it's likely a lot of those people are choosing MathCamp over Ross because it's more \"fun\" or is much more flexible. People only go to Ross if they're really intent on learning number theory for the most part while MathCamp attracts a much broader set of people. That means the camps are different but not that MathCamp is more prestigious than Ross.\n\nSection III: Updates from last year (December 2011)\n\nI wrote this last year about the Ross program and much has stayed the same since then. I\u0092ve decide to repost this with updates because some things have changed and the application is coming out soon so there will probably be increased interest in this in the near future. This is cross-posted from AoPS as well.\n\nGeneral Updates: The biggest change is that the program will be six weeks instead of eight this summer. The change is occurring because Ohio State is changing its academic calendar so Ross needs to be out of the dorms by the beginning of August. I\u0092m not sure how this will affect the program other than less material will be covered and the program will be somewhat cheaper. The other important changes would be the change in hours of the student union food options and the prohibition on using library computers. Two years ago, the food options in the student union, which is generally considered to have the best food, were open all seven days. Last year it was closed on weekends and you had to eat at the inferior north commons during the weekends. Additionally, two years ago we were allowed to use the computers in the Science & Engineering Library. Last year we were not. I do not know what will happen next year but my guess would be is that it will be like last year. I have corrected some typos throughout the document. I added some additional comments throughout the document and marked them with [NEW11: _____]. I would also welcome comparative experiences from anyone who went to PROMYS particularly if they\u0092ve been to Ross as well. I\u0092m also happy to answer any questions you may have.\n[NEW12: The food situation continues to be in flux as described above while the prohibition on library computers has remained]\n\nSection IV: Original Post from May 2011\n\n\n\nOver the past year I've posted a lot about my experience at Ross last summer both on the site and at CC as UMTYMP student. Given that the responses are in like 8 threads on two sites I've decided to try and collect all my responses in one thread. This will also be posted on college confidential.\n\nFrom the 2010 Ross thread on college confidential\n\nshushugah, I don't think it makes sense to compare the camps from best to worst. The camps cater towards different interests. For example, if you want to spend 8 weeks doing math almost constantly Ross is probably the best choice. But if you want to do things that aren't math related Ross isn't as good of a choice. From what I've heard HCiSSM places a large emphasis on its inside jokes and having fun. Awesome Math seems very geared towards competitions. Mathcamp seems to focus on various interesting subjects of math. Ross and PRMOYS are both entirely number theory. Another consideration is whether you prefer to work alone or in groups. At Ross working in groups is generally looked down upon. Often times at Ross you might spend hours or even days working alone on one particular problem. My understanding is that the doesn't really happen at other camps. While spending 8 days on one problem like I did at Ross last year might simulate actual research it wouldn't be very helpful in terms of math competitions.\n\nIn terms of instructors, I'm only familiar with Ross. The instructors are good but most of the learning you do by yourself anyways so they're not that important.\n\nGlad to have helped. At Ross, there is an hour of lecture each day and 3 days a week there is a 1 hour seminar. The lectures generally either explain new concepts, explore interesting tangents, or will go over old problem sets. The seminars are run by different people and some of them explore more tangential stuff like set theory while others focus on discussions of problems from the problem sets. Another important thing to note is that you work at your own pace. Oftentimes, a lecture will go over a proof from an old problem set so if you're going at a fast pace you'll have proved it by yourself but if you're going slower they'll give you the proof sometimes.\n\nFrom the 2011 Ross thread on college confidential\n\nThe instructors are professors either at OSU or nearby colleges.\n\n@kgppra053420 Essentially, the Ross program is doing number theory problem sets. The only required activities are 1-2 hours of class per day Monday-Friday. The rest of your time you can spend as you like though you will be expected to spend a lot of it working on the problem sets. The problem sets are composed of a mixture of numericals, where you will look at patterns and formulate conjectures and theorems to prove. Some of the problems are trivial, while others are extraordinarily difficult. After you finish a problem set, you'll turn it in to your counselor. Then after a day or two usually you will meet with your counselor and discuss the set. Although different counselors have very different methods for doing this, you will usually be expected to redo any problems you didn't solve correctly the first time. The rest of your time can be spent exercising, with friends, or doing other stuff although generally you won't have too much time for this. The quality of life is also pretty good. You'll get a 2-room dorm and will have 1 roommate. You'll also get a meal card, which allows you to get more than enough food. The food is also of pretty quality as well but the lack of choices can get old by the end of the summer. If you have any more specific questions, I'd be happy to answer them as well.\n\n[NEW11: On weekends the food quality can be pretty bad]\n[NEW12: See discussion of food above]\n\nThe facilities are pretty decent. Our dorm building last year was pretty old but the dorm rooms themselves were nice and had a bedroom with bunk beds, a study room, and a bathroom. There was some communal rooms in the dorm where a lot of people would hang out. Although I never went to the athletic center, I heard it was of excellent quality. The student center where most people ate is also very new. Sets can either be done alone or in groups of people of like 2-3 people although there are no hard rules regarding this. You certainly would be able to work with your roommate as long as both of you pulled your own weight but not nobody will force you to work with them or anyone else for that matter.\n[NEW11: We were in the same dorm last year and it\u0092s getting worse. There were some problems with the dorm that didn\u0092t really affect things. Hopefully we will be in a different dorm this summer.]\n[NEW12: We were in the same dorm but they made necessary repairs so there were no problems with the dorm]\n\n@kgppra053420 Ross is pretty strict about not letting you bring laptops. If you have a specific purpose that you'll need one for they may allow you to bring it for that purpose only. However, while it is not exactly true that there are computers in the dorm, you can go to the campus library to use computers. Although the counselors will be unhappy if you spend too much time using the computers, you will be able to use them for pretty much whatever you want to do.\n[NEW11: Counselors will be unhappy if you spend any time using computers at the library. Additionally, you can\u0092t really use them as they now require passwords which you won\u0092t have. If you have an actual need to use one you will be able too though.]\n[NEW12: Let me be absolutely clear: LAPTOPS ARE PROHIBITED (unless you have specific permission from Shapiro). Every year a couple people bring them and then the counselors confiscate them for the rest of the summer. You will survive without a laptop for the summer (and of course if you have an actual need for one you can borrow one from a counselor).]\n\nYou will probably initially be a bit behind but you should be able to catch up pretty quickly if you are well prepared. Some people came late last year and it certainly didn't affect them by the end of the summer. I am not positive that they will send you the work you miss but I've heard that other places and would think that it is probably true.\n[NEW12: The new policy is that Ross will not accommodate anyone who will have to arrive more than a couple of days late]\n\nI don't think Ross is terribly strict on its no leaving policy. If you have a good reason, they should be fine with it. If your reason is not so good, they'll probably grumble but let you go anyways.\n\nThe Ross program gives a list of course topics here: The Ross Mathematics Summer Program for high school students, held on The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio. I wouldn't worry about looking like an idiot due to lack of talent. Ross will only accept people who will be able to do decently well if they work. The people who do the worst at Ross are without exception those who are too lazy to work hard. I wouldn't recommend studying number theory before coming to Ross; you'll do more than enough number theory at Ross. However, if you want to prepare for Ross I would recommend working on proof writing. I think you'd be better off studying something like logic or set theory before coming to Ross.\n\nRoss will not allow you to bring a laptop for gaming. Although playing games on library computers is technically prohibited and will make the counselors like you less, plenty of people do it anyways and they won't actually stop you.\n[NEW11: No gaming anymore due to prohibition on using library computers discussed above.]\nPeople spend wildly varying amounts of time on the problem sets. Some people might only spend a couple of hours a day on math although those people don't do that well. Others will spend like 12 hours a day every day on problem sets. I think it takes the average Ross student 2-3 days to do a set although there is wide variation. You can work in groups or by yourself. Although it is kinda frowned upon if you come up with the solutions with other people it is not prohibited and it is certainly acceptable to bounce ideas off other people. People at Ross are on about every schedule imaginable. Some people work in the morning and afternoon and relax in the evening. Personally, my schedule was roughly like this\n9 AM wake up and go to classes\n10-11 AM after classes have lunch\n12 PM go back to the dorm and take a nap\n4 PM wake up and either work or go to the library to use computers\n6 PM dinner\n7 PM -4 AM work on problem sets\n4 AM go to bed. Every week there is a frisbee game and some weeks there is another scheduled activity. For the most part though, free time is yours to use as you wish. Some people like to go the gym or hang out. You can also take a break more or less whenever you want as long as you remain productive.\n[NEW12: My schedule is quite atypical though]\n\nStudents are not allowed off campus without a counselor. However, there is a CVS on the far side of campus and counselors routinely take people to the closer one as well. There is a also a university bookstore on campus but I think those are only two place you'll have easy access to. There is a movie theater near campus but I don't think students are normally allowed to go there. Essentially, there are 5 major rules at Ross:\n1. Get problem sets done at a reasonable rate\n2. Don't leave campus without a counselor\n3. Be in the dorms after dark\n4. Go to the 1-2 hours of classes a day.\n5. Don't possess prohibited items such as laptops.\nOther than those 5 rules, your behavior at Ross is more or less unrestricted.\n\nThere are no classes, so most people sleep in. You're expected to work on math for part of the time but the rest of the time is free. I guess at Ross the line between free time and math time is very blurred. Some camps might be like 4-6 work on math and then 6-8 free time but at Ross other than for classes all the time is free but you're expected to get stuff done. There were certainly weekends where I was on set [at Ross you're said to be on set if you've finished all the problem sets handed out so far. in the beginning there are typically a small group of people on set which shrinks until more or less everyone is no longer on set] and spent little to no time during math. Even if you are never on set, you could probably take a day or two off from math if you really wanted to.\n\nI'll be coming back as a junior counselor. I'm not sure if you're allowed to use all the athletic facilities but I know you're allowed to go the main gym center. I think some people played tennis but I'm not sure. I assume you'd be allowed to bring a racket but again I'm not really sure. To be honest, I never used the athletic facilities although I think almost everyone else did.\n\nSo my friend tells me you're allowed to use 'Everything but rock wall, basically'.\n[NEW11: I actually went to the athletic facilities once last summer. They\u0092re really nice and you\u0092re allowed to use them but you must resist the temptation to spend too much time there or you will invoke the wrath of the counselors.]\n[NEW12: The counselors are serious about people not spending too much time at the gym. If your main goal is to work out then go elsewhere]\n\nFrom the thread PROMYS, ROSS, or mathcamp on art of problem solving\n\n\nI think nikeballa96 describes Mathcamp and PROMYS pretty accurately but isn't as familiar with Ross. I went to Ross last summer and will return this summer as a junior counselor. Another important difference between the camps is how much time is spent learning techniques and theorems compared to how much time is spent proving theorems. My understanding is that Mathcamp is more like a regular math class in this regard and that classes due to their short length just go over the major results. At Ross however you'll spend most of your time coming up with proofs. I think PROMYS is somewhere in between in that every day you try to prove some theorems and then you get solutions at the end of the day. I would agree that if you're into competition math then go to Mathcamp. If you want to focus on number theory than either PROMYS or Ross. I would say go to PROMYS if you care about having fun but go to Ross if you want to truly learn math as the longer and more intensive experience allows you to come up with some really deep ideas.\n[NEW11: Some of the counselors last summer have previously been at PROMYS. You don\u0092t actually receive solutions at the end of every day but instead you move on anyways. Near the end of PROMYS I think people typically focus on 1 or 2 themes that build on each other but I\u0092m not really sure.]\n\nMaybe this is just my skewed perspective but I'm not sure PROMYS is just as intense as Ross. For one Ross is about 2 weeks longer than PROMYS which is something to consider. Maybe I am mistaken but I was under the impression that at PROMYS every day you get a problem set, work on it and then at the end of the day go over it with your counselor. Maybe this is wrong but at PROMYS is everyone working the same set? At Ross you spend as much time as it takes to solve all the problems on the set which can is some cases be more than a week. This leads to by the end of camp some people being on set 30 and others on set 10.\nI agree that both are overall at the same level and have similar levels of students. I think there are stylistic differences between the camps though as some people from PROMYS have talked about spending time exploring Boston. I'm sure that's what some people want to spend their summer doing but that's not what people at Ross do.\n[NEW11: See previous new comment. I maintain that Ross is slightly more intense than PROMYS but only mildly. The Ross counselors who had previously gone to PROMYS agreed with this sentiment too.]\n[NEW12: Other PROMYS attendees have mentioned exploring Boston as one advantage of PROMYS. Although that may be fun, it is one important way that PROMYS is less intense than ROSS is where the emphasis is always on math]\n\nFrom the thread PROMYS and Ross on art of problem solving\n\nFor a general overview of the two programs, you should look at each program's individual thread and the thread comparing Mathcamp, PROMYS, and Ross. Ross and PROMYS are actually pretty similar as PROMYS was created to be like Ross. Here are some differences though\n1. Ross is 8 weeks and PROMYS is 6 weeks. This allows you to do considerably more math at Ross but at the cost of more of your summer. I think the programs charge similar amounts of money so Ross is considerably cheaper per day.\n2. Ross is Columbus, Ohio and PROMYS is in Boston. Although Columbus, Ohio has to be one of the most boring places in the US, the lack of interesting surroundings helps you focus on math. I heard at PROMYS people explore Boston which may be exciting but probably does not encourage doing math.\n3. At Ross, first years are not allowed to bring laptops. I think PROMYS allows first years to bring laptops. I can imagine that laptops would significantly cut down on mathematical productivity although they would allow you to play more games. At Ross you can still use computers in the library but you have to be in the dorms after dark. At Ross you can also get yelled out for playing computer games. I do not know the policy for this at PROMYS.\n4. At Ross first years focus pretty much exclusively on the number theory problem sets. According to the PROMYS thread, some first years at PROMYS do some kind of research thing which does not seem directly related to the number theory problem sets.\n5. At Ross you work at your own pace so different people can be working on very different stuff at any given time. By the end of the camp, the number of sets people have done resembles a bell curve. The top students are usually on sets 25-30 (there are 31 sets and typically one student every 2-3 years finishes all the sets). the good students are on sets 20-25, the average students on sets 15-20, and the lazy students fail to finish 15. At Ross if you do something wrong on a set you end up redoing the problem.\nI'm not entirely sure how PROMYS works so if someone who went there can correct me if I'm wrong about this that's be great but I think at PROMYS you get a problem set every day similar to Ross but then you go over it with your counselor at the end of the day. I think this means that at PROMYS everyone is on roughly the same set and if you don't solve a problem you'll eventually get a solution for it.\n\nIn conclusion, I think at Ross you'll end up doing more math while at PROMYS you'll end up doing more other stuff.\n\nIf you have questions that aren't answered in any of these posts feel free to ask and I'll do my best to answer them.\n\n[NEW11: See previous new comments on PROMYS. Ross is no longer 8 weeks so that difference no long matters. Ross is now somewhat cheaper than PROMYS though. I heard first years are not allowed laptops at PROMYS but I\u0092m not sure how strictly that\u0092s enforced.]                "}, {"date": "2004-10-29T15:01:14+00:00", "url": "http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/college-admissions/4294-music-theory-research-physics.html", "messages": "\n                    Suprise! This is my common app essay. I didn't really write it with one of their prompts in mind, so there's not really a specific prompt to evaluate it against. Any feedback is appreciated!\n\nA flute and guitar duet affectionately entitled \u0093Blargh\u0094 marked my debut as a composer last June. While it may seem odd, I believe that composing will be one of the most valuable experiences I\u0092ve had as I pursue a research-based career in physics.\n\nTo begin composing, I determined the nature and scope of the piece I would write. Instrumentation was my first concern. I settled on guitar \u0096 an instrument I\u0092ve played since the fourth grade- and flute - an instrument whose timbre sonically compliments guitar. After selecting instrumentation, I determined form, tonality, and estimate length.\n\nTaking these first steps of composition is like deciding upon a research topic; each defines and constrains the task. My task was to create a two minute-long, ternary song, in D major, that would build and expand upon the style of a Baroque duet. When I conduct research as a physicist, my task may be to explore the behavior and creation of terahertz radiation, filling gap in the electromagnetic wave spectrum. But the over-arching goal remains the same: to use accepted theory to expand the current spectrum of knowledge. To a composer, that collection of knowledge is all the written music; to a scientist, it is scientific research to date. The best composers and best scientists are simultaneously the most knowledgeable and the most creative. They push past the boundaries of current knowledge by creatively using what is known to discover even more; the more creative they are, the farther they push.\n\nThe actual composition followed the initial planning. I turned rough harmonies and melodic sketches into polished music. This step in the song-writing process mirrors developing a procedure. Both outline the approach to a goal. If I follow the sheet music, I will play my song; if I follow the procedure, I will conduct my experiment.\nDuring the composing, I continually played and listened to what I was writing. As a scientist would often adjust procedure to improve results after completing a few trials, I constantly reworked my initial harmonies and melodies to elevate the musical quality of my composition. All these changes will result in the definitive trials from which data is used to support the claim, the performance that best realizes the score. I performed my duet for my music theory class, with a fellow student, as a demonstration that my score was possible to play and musically sound. As a scientist, I will conduct demonstrations for to show that my procedure is viable and produces accurate results. This certifiable repetition is essential in both science and music. Other musicians should be able to play my duet; other scientists should be able to conduct my experiment. Both should yield the same results.\n\nAfter performing, I discussed the crafting of my duet, and answered questions from my teacher and my class about my piece. This final stage of the project, again, directly correlates to the final stages of research. As a researcher, I will be required to defend the validity of all aspects of my research as I had to prepare to defend any harmony, any cadence, any melodic statement in my piece.\n\nIt comes as no surprise to me that what is perceived as one of the most creative careers, composition, can be drawn so closely parallel to what is perceived as one of the most technical careers, research. Each requires a balance of theory and creativity: theory is the foundation from which creativity builds. I will construct my career in physics on that philosophy.

My first essay received a 10, when I thought it would receive an even lower score. I took another practice test and my essay score was a 12, when I thought it would be a 10 at best. If anyone could read/grade/comment on my essay, I would greatly appreciate it.\n\nI didn't put very much detail in my examples, and I basically blabbed about them. I'm afraid this won't do on test day, so here goes:\n\nPrompt:\n\nPeople's lives are the result of the choices they make\u0097or fail to make. The path one takes in life is not arbitrary. Choices and their consequences determine the course of every person's life. All people, whatever their circumstances, make the choices on which their lives depend.\n\nAre people's lives the result of the choices they make? Plan and write an essay in which you develop your point of view on this issue. Support your position with reasoning and examples taken from your reading, studies, experience, or observations.\n\n\nEssay:\n\nThe choices that people make result in the lives they live. ALthough some may argue that one is born into a certain life or they can be pre-destined, ultimately only we can choose our destiny. This is evident throughout history, society, and even my own personal experiences.\nThe choices we make determine the course of history. An example that exemplifies this is evident in World War II. Hitler had full control of his army and the political platform, the Nazis. With the majority of Europe under his power, it was only a matter of time that he would ultimately control most of the Western world. Luckily, the United States had stepped in and interfered with the Nazi's plans. In hind sight, the United States government and people changed the course of hisotry, otherwise it is very well possible that our nation and world today would be under dictatorship. This event is like a maze. There are so many different possible outcomes of the situation. These choices have altered the lives of many by changing the course of history.\nIn our advancing society, we are growing away from social \"castes\" and growing towards social mobility, which allows even the poorest of the poor to grow up to be the richest of the rich through the choices we make. For example, the United States in particular supports democracy and capitalism. This allows many to choose which types of lives they want. Many can choose to go to college to further his or her education. Others want to take over a family business. These choices were not available many years ago, even today in some countries. However, we are able to choose our destiny, because changes in society have been assimilated it. It is evident that in many developed countries, the choices we make directly allows us to choose what type of life we want.\nThe things we do now are directly related to what we have done in the past, through recreations and hobbies. I am now an aspiring tennis player. When I was young, I had the privledge to choose between playing tennis and hockey. Though I loved both at the time, I ultimately chose to stick with playing tennis, because I had found more in iit. At first, I had only played on weekends and after school, but soon I was playing in tournaments. If I had no chosen to stick with tennis, I would not be surprised to find myself doing something else today. Even the small things we find pleasure in doing today have a great impact upon what we have in the future.\nThe choices we have made in the past are direct result of what we have today. This is evident but not limited to history, society, and even in personal instances.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks for your time!

Seeing music as the perfect medium for such an event, as the majority of us were musicians in bands outside of school, we decided to put together a concert in the backyard of one of our houses.  I, as well as several others, ended up being jointly responsible for the booking, organizing, promotion, as well as performance at the show, which became one of the \u0093hottest\u0094 events of the school year for several high schools.  The organization of the event went as far as to provide services such as food, security and valet parking for all patrons.  The show brought in over 500 students to see 4 bands (all of which played free of charge, and one of which I was the drummer of) in an incredible live setting (rented sound equipment, rented lights, beautiful backyard), and raised money in the mid-thousands, 100% of which was donated to the high school (all service expenses were paid for out of pocket) for the building of a memorial in the form of a score-board for the soccer field.\n\n-Concert for Charity at local Jewish Centerr (11) \u0096 Seeing the incredible results in the previous year\u0092s backyard concert, two of my good friends and I decided to put on another similar show, this time donating to charity rather than the community.  3 bands performed, 2 of which I was in.  After renting us their gym for the show, the center allowed us full and complete freedom in the organizing of the show.  This put the responsibility for running a smooth show on the three of us; we had to rent and borrow sound equipment, rent lighting equipment, promote the show, book the bands (all of which played for free, and 2 of which I was the drummer of), and actually control all aspects of the show, from the ticket selling to the soundboard and lighting rig, all while playing in several of the bands.  The show was an exhausting but overall a very fulfilling endeavor; while we met many setbacks (such as lighting equipment not being delivered properly and poor early ticket sales that nearly forced us to cancel), in the end, the event was a great success, and brought in a surprisingly large sum of money which was donated to The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society.\n\n-Intern for Local Presiding Officer of the Legislature (11, 12 - ~2.5 hrs/week all year long)\n\n-School Blood Drive (11) \u0096 Along with many of my peers, I helped run this fantastically successful event in which for an entire day, students [of legal age] and teachers had the opportunity to donate their blood.

Currently, however, the direction is making a turn for the worse. Though some may argue that modern technology has brought comfort and convenience to households worldwide, such an effect is actually deconstructive to the goodness of mankind. Technology takes away the people\u0092s independence, it creates the media\u0092s overlordship over people, which in turn causes a decline of morality in the world.\n\nTechnology is a necessary essence in the definition of modern and future. It brings about various conveniences for people. Cars help us travel, refrigerators help preserve food, microprocessors automizes many aspects of our lives and computers help us in terms of information and communication. These are only few of the many examples of the prevailing technology of our time. These technologies, however, take away people\u0092s needs to do tasks manually. For example, there are even tools that help the simple task of beating an egg! As the way technology progresses, eventually it will reach a point when people no longer need to do anything voluntarily \u0096 food is fed, knowledge is inserted into the brain via disks. Life will be an overly simple process. Surely, such a situation is not a good one.\n\nMedia is also a product of technology and is being projected to us through TV, internet, films, advertisements, radio, and other various forms of information technology. Media has a large influence on the way people think. In the movie E.T., Reese\u0092s candy pieces is subliminally advertised through its use as a prop. Afterwards their sales skyrocketed. This is only one of the numerous examples in which media controls our lives. As technology advances, media will gain influence and power. Eventually people will lose their sense of original thought and psychologists can source all thought processes to media. Such a possibility is unacceptable.\n\nAlso due to media is the people\u0092s decline in morals. Through movies and TV, we are bombarded by immorality. R-rated films and shows are being watched by all age groups. For example, I observed a woman holding a baby during a screening of \u0093War of the Worlds\u0094, an R-rated movie showing intense, shocking violence. Bombardment of immorality such as the violence stated above has influence on people\u0092s behavior. The effects can be seen in the growing numbers of girls wearing revealing clothing and the growing interest of violence in boys. Immorality will, most definitely, yield problematic results.\n\nThe dependence on technology, influence of media, and decline of morals all highlight the problematic direction society is progressing towards. If nothing is to be done, eventually the results will be disastrous.\n\n================\nI find my biggest problem is not being able to attend to details while writing at high speed. I attempted a couple of essays with the grammatix method and this one (somehow turned out to not follow the method as much) seemed to be the best I can do.

In fact, I think this one actually went over the time limit by 3 minutes, which is a problem.\n\nPlease grade it.\n\nAnd... are there any last-minute tips for writing the essay?

Here is what I have found out.\n\nI compare Cal to UVA, Stanford and Yale.  I could not find info on other elite schools, and I use UVA because it has similar placement to Cal in general but also includes general\n\nhttp://www.career.virginia.edu/stud.../LSAT-GPA04.pdf\nhttp://career.berkeley.edu/Law/lawStats.stm\nhttp://www.yale.edu/career/students/gradprof/lawschool/media/statistics2004.pdf\nhttp://www.stanford.edu/dept/undergrad/uac/preprof/05prelawstats.pdf\n\nThe average GPA for these schools are respectively using www.gradeinflation.com\n\nUVA - 2001 (academic year) 3.18\nCal - 1996 - 3.10\nStanford - 1992 - 3.44\nYale - unknown? - not really known for grade inflation though.\n\nMost schools use an academic index for admissions, with gpa and the LSAT, with the LSAT accounting for around 50-60% of the index score.  .1 gpa = 1 LSAT point.\n\n\nThis are all for the graduating class of 2004.  I'll compare how these 4 undergraduate institutions did in terms of their admissions to the top 3 law schools (HYS), the average LSAT and GPA of admits, and the average LSAT and GPA of the undergrad institutions themselves.\n\nHarvard Law School.\nSchool / Admitted / Matriculated / Avg LSAT / Avg GPA\nCal  / 12 / 9  / 171    / 3.93\nUVA / 7  / 3  / 173    / 3.87\nStan/ 59/ 35 / 171.5 /3.78\nYale /62 / 37 / 171.5 / 3.81\n\nYale Law School\nCal / 2 / 1 / 169 / 3.93 (one admit was URM)\nUVA / 5 / 5/ 171 / 3.79\nStan/ 22/14/171.1/3.83\nYale / 34 / 24/171.8/3.86\n\nStanford Law School\nCal  / 3 / 1 /170  /3.99\nUVA /5  / 2 /170  /3.91\nStan/37/16/169.7/3.82\nYale/36 /13/170.3/3.83\n\nColumbia Law\nCal / 7 / 5 / 172 / 3.79\nUVA/18/ 4 / 171/ 3.74\nStan/37/16/169.7/3.82\nYale/78/14/170.4/3.74\n\nNYU Law\nCal  /24 / 5/171/3.83\nUVA/26 / 8 /170 /3.68\nStan/81 /10 /170.7/3.72\nYale/92 /15 /171.2/3.74\n\nNow the career center numbers are only for GRADUATING seniors wheras all the other numbers refer to seniors and alumni.  Hence, the berkely nubmers are definitely skewed against admittance to Yale and Stanford since they are small schools and can afford to differentiate by soft factors.\n\nThe numbers are also skewed in general because of this; law schools often assign a lot of weight on soft factors, all else being held equal, so a graduating senior will be at a disadvantage to a graduate with the same statistics but a few years work experience.\n\nCal seems to do about as well as UVA across the board, even though the numbers are drawn from different population samples, the numbers are quite similar and I'll use UVA as analagous to Cal (since Cal doesn't post information on non-seniors).  In most cases Cal and UVA numbers seem similar as are the aggregate academic index average for the admits from each school.\n\nAt Harvard LS, Cal students needed 1 LSAT point higher on their academic index versus Yale and Stanford (easily explainable in relation .   YLS's stats are not comparable for Cal since one of the 2 admits was a URM.  Using UVA's number as a baseline, and taking Cal's numbers with a grain salt, public school students actually had slightly worst numbers than Stanford and Yale admits - yet this is probably a result of admitting 4 to 6 times the number of people from SY versus Cal for Yale.  Stanford Law School's statistics mirror those for Yale LS.\n\nGoing on to bigger Law schools like Columbia and NYU (400+ each), where numbers are going to be a more critical component for admissions, we see at Columbia and NYU you see many more admits than from Cal, but fewer matriculations (all the ones that are going to HYS Law School), so that in the end only about 2-3 times the number of students from Yale and Stanford go to Columbia and NYU versus UVA and Berkeley.  The numbers from Columbia showing students from UVA having to score 1 LSAT point higher in general.\n\nThe numbers from NYU seem to show Yale students having to score 1 point higher relative to UVA, and Cal and Yale showing similar numbers.\n\nAcross the board, it seems like Cal students are pretty evenly matched with their counterparts at Yale and Stanford--they seem to get in with mostly the same stats.\n\nThe slightly higher academic index of cal admits to top law schools could easily be explained by the fact that cal's numbers are only for graduating seniors, and not all of Cal.\n\nUVA's numbers match up better with Stanford and Yale's and can probably be said to be representative of similar results from Cal.\n\nSo if Cal students are getting in with similar grades, is this fair to them?\n\nStolen from another post I made:\n\n\"http://web.archive.org/web/20000829094953/http://www.pcmagic.net/abe/gradeadj.htm\n\n'Under the Boalt formula, each college is ranked according to how its students perform on the standardized law board exam, the LSAT, and how common a certain G.P.A. is at that school.'\n\nBerkeley evidently suffers from grade inflation too with an average gpa of 3.25 (versus 3.7 (not so sure on this number)).\n\nhttp://ls.berkeley.edu/undergrad/colloquia/04-11.html\n\nSince the average gpa at berkely is 3.25 (much higher for humanities according to the article) and Stanford's only about a 3.7, this would be about 3.5 LSAT points worth of difference. Stanford's average LSAT is 165 versus Berkeley's 161 (Yale's is 165 as well). This is a 4 point LSAT difference. Berkeley's index in that list is 78.5 versus stanford's 80.5, which seems to make sense considering the facts. \"  Yale's index number is 82.5 (probably because it has harder grading than Stanford).\n\nEven though Stanford has a higher average GPA, this GPA is from competing against a much higher quality student body than at Cal.  The same is true for Harvard and Yale.  The ivies just have a greater concentration of smart students so that even a grade inflated A at Harvard is worth more than an A at Cal where one would be competing against worst students. the index seems to mitigate these differences and makes a Cal GPA about an LSAT point worst than one at Stanford/Yale/Harvard, despite grade inflation.   Still, relative to most schools, Cal is still doing very well.\n\nSo in short, despite \"GPA deflation\" at Cal, colleges for the most part understand this and adjust it in their index, which in the end hurts Cal students a little bit.  The help that should come from grade deflation is offset (and then some) by the fact that the student body is so worst relative to Yale, Stanford, and other top schools.\n\nIs this fair?  I'm going to argue no.  Since Cal is so big and certain departments are equal in size to entire undergraduate popuations, using an academic index that uses the average GPA at Berkeley is more likely to be rife with problems since you are compacting so many people into one aggregate statistic.\n\nThe grade inflation of other schools relative to Cal can still hurt cal students as I will show below.\n\nFor example, all the \"--\" studies majors are easy knockoff majors that will give you a 4.0 without a doubt.  The article I posted above: http://ls.berkeley.edu/undergrad/colloquia/04-11.html\n\nShows that there is a dramatic difference between the GPA's of the humanities and sciences.  Lets say for example that the average gpa in a science is 2.5 and the average GPA in a humanities course is 3.7.  That will average out to be 3.1 (berkeley's average gpa) if equal numbers of people are in both departments.\n\nStanford has an average overall gpa of 3.5.  Lets say that the average humanities GPA is a 3.8 (not much room to go up, and I'm certain that even at stanford, not THAT many people get straight A's).  That means the average science gpa will be 3.2 if there are equal numbers of science and humanities students.\n\nSo, even with an index that accounts for grade inflation, depending on the spread of grades at a school, this may especially screw over students in certain majors.  I believe a fairer way of adjusting gpa's is to compare a person's major gpa to the average gpa in their major.\n\nThis inequality makes it easier for students in the humanities to \"free-ride\" off Berkeley's low average GPA by taking an \"\n\n\" studies major.  They get a ridiculously easy curve, but are helped by the fact that Berkeley''s average gpa is so crappy: it makes their grades actually look like it required much more than a slight amount of effort.  They ride on the backs of the science/engineering majors who are the ones getting screwed over.

But striding through campus on his way to class at the University of California, Berkeley, Mr. Hu hears Mandarin all the time, in plazas, cafeterias, classrooms, study halls, dorms and fast-food outlets. It is part of the soundtrack at this iconic university, along with Cantonese, English, Spanish and, of course, the perpetual jackhammers from the perpetual construction projects spurred by the perpetual fund drives.\n\n?Here, many people speak Chinese as their primary language,? says Mr. Hu, a sophomore. ?It?s nice. You really feel like you don?t stand out.?\n\nToday, he is iPod-free, a rare condition on campus, taking in the early winter sun at the dour concrete plaza of the Free Speech Movement Cafe, named for the protests led by Mario Savio in 1964, when the administration tried to muzzle political activity. ?Free speech marks us off from the stones and stars,? reads a Savio quote on the cafe wall, ?just below the angels.?\n\nThere are now mostly small protests, against the new chain stores invading Telegraph Avenue, just outside the campus entrance, and to save the old oak trees scheduled for removal so the football stadium can be renovated. The biggest buzz on Telegraph one week was the grand opening of a chain restaurant ? the new Chipotle?s, which drew a crowd of students eager to get in. The scent of patchouli oil and reefer is long gone; the street is posted as a drug-free zone.\n\nAnd at least on this morning, there is very little speech of any kind inside the Free Speech Cafe; almost without exception, students are face-planted in their laptops, silently downloading class notes, music, messages. It could be the library but for the line for lattes. On mornings like this, the public university beneath the towering campanile seems like a small, industrious city of ?ber-students in flops.\n\nI ask Mr. Hu what it?s like to be on a campus that is overwhelmingly Asian ? what it?s like to be of the demographic moment. This fall and last, the number of Asian freshmen at Berkeley has been at a record high, about 46 percent. The overall undergraduate population is 41 percent Asian. On this golden campus, where a creek runs through a redwood grove, there are residence halls with Asian themes; good dim sum is never more than a five-minute walk away; heaping, spicy bowls of pho are served up in the Bear?s Lair cafeteria; and numerous social clubs are linked by common ancestry to countries far across the Pacific.\n\nMr. Hu shrugs, saying there is a fair amount of ?selective self-racial segregation,? which is not unusual at a university this size: about 24,000 undergraduates. ?The different ethnic groups don?t really interact that much,? he says. ?There?s definitely a sense of sticking with your community.? But, he quickly adds, ?People of my generation don?t look at race as that big of a deal. People here, the freshmen and sophomores, they?re pretty much like your average American teenagers.?\n\nSpend a few days at Berkeley, on the classically manicured slope overlooking San Francisco Bay and the distant Pacific, and soon enough the sound of foreign languages becomes less distinct. This is a global campus in a global age. And more than any time in its history, it looks toward the setting sun for its identity.\n\nThe revolution at Berkeley is a quiet one, a slow turning of the forces of immigration and demographics. What is troubling to some is that the big public school on the hill certainly does not look like the ethnic face of California, which is 12 percent Asian, more than twice the national average. But it is the new face of the state?s vaunted public university system. Asians make up the largest single ethnic group, 37 percent, at its nine undergraduate campuses.\n\nThe oft-cited goal of a public university is to be a microcosm ? in this case, of the nation?s most populous, most demographically dynamic state ? and to enrich the educational experience with a variety of cultures, economic backgrounds and viewpoints.\n\nBut 10 years after California passed Proposition 209, voting to eliminate racial preferences in the public sector, university administrators find such balance harder to attain. At the same time, affirmative action is being challenged on a number of new fronts, in court and at state ballot boxes. And elite colleges have recently come under attack for practicing it ? specifically, for bypassing highly credentialed Asian applicants in favor of students of color with less stellar test scores and grades.\n\nIn California, the rise of the Asian campus, of the strict meritocracy, has come at the expense of historically underrepresented blacks and Hispanics. This year, in a class of 4809, there are only 100 black freshmen at the University of California at Los Angeles ? the lowest number in 33 years. At Berkeley, 3.6 percent of freshmen are black, barely half the statewide proportion. (In 1997, just before the full force of Proposition 209 went into effect, the proportion of black freshmen matched the state population, 7 percent.) The percentage of Hispanic freshmen at Berkeley (11 percent) is not even a third of the state proportion (35 percent). White freshmen (29 percent) are also below the state average (44 percent).\n\nThis is in part because getting into Berkeley ? U.S. News & World Report?s top-ranked public university ? has never been more daunting. There were 41,750 applicants for this year?s freshman class of 4,157. Nearly half had a weighted grade point average of 4.0 or better (weighted for advanced courses). There is even grumbling from ?the old Blues? ? older alumni named for the school color ? ?who complain because their kids can?t get in,? says Gregg Thomson, director of the Office of Student Research.\n\nMr. Hu applied to a lot of colleges, but Berkeley felt right for him from the start. ?It?s the intellectual atmosphere ? this place is intense.?\n\nMr. Hu says he was pressured by a professor to go into something like medicine or engineering. ?It?s a stereotype, but a lot of Asians who come here just study engineering and the sciences,? he says. ?I was never interested in that.?\n\nBut as the only son of professionals born in China, Mr. Hu fits the profile of Asians at Berkeley in at least one way: they are predominantly first-generation American. About 95 percent of Asian freshmen come from a family in which one or both parents were born outside the United States.\n\nHe dashes off to class, and I wander through the serene setting of Memorial Glade, in the center of campus, and then loop over to Sproul Plaza, the beating heart of the university, where dozens of tables are set up by clubs representing every conceivable ethnic group. Out of nowhere, an a cappella group, mostly Asian men, appears and starts singing a Beach Boys song. Yes, tradition still matters in California.\n\nACROSS the United States, at elite private and public universities, Asian enrollment is near an all-time high. Asian-Americans make up less than 5 percent of the population but typically make up 10 to 30 percent of students at the nation?s best colleges:in 2005, the last year with across-the-board numbers, Asians made up 24 percent of the undergraduate population at Carnegie Mellon and at Stanford, 27 percent at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 14 percent at Yale and 13 percent at Princeton.\n\nAnd according to advocates of race-neutral admissions policies, those numbers should be even higher.\n\nAsians have become the ?new Jews,? in the phrase of Daniel Golden, whose recent book, ?The Price of Admission: How America?s Ruling Class Buys Its Way Into Elite Colleges ? and Who Gets Left Outside the Gates,? is a polemic against university admissions policies. Mr. Golden, a reporter for The Wall Street Journal, is referring to evidence that, in the first half of the 20th century, Ivy League schools limited the number of Jewish students despite their outstanding academic records to maintain the primacy of upper-class Protestants. Today, he writes, ?Asian-Americans are the odd group out, lacking racial preferences enjoyed by other minorities and the advantages of wealth and lineage mostly accrued by upper-class whites. Asians are typecast in college admissions offices as quasi-robots programmed by their parents to ace math and science.?\n\nAs if to illustrate the point, a study released in October by the Center for Equal Opportunity, an advocacy group opposing race-conscious admissions, showed that in 2005 Asian-Americans were admitted to the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, at a much lower rate (54 percent) than black applicants (71 percent) and Hispanic applicants (79 percent) ? despite median SAT scores that were 140 points higher than Hispanics and 240 points higher than blacks.\n\nTo force the issue on a legal level, a freshman at Yale filed a complaint in the fall with the Department of Education?s Office of Civil Rights, contending he was denied admission to Princeton because he is Asian. The student, Jian Li, the son of Chinese immigrants in Livingston, N.J., had a perfect SAT score and near-perfect grades, including numerous Advanced Placement courses.\n\n?This is just a very, very egregious system,? Mr. Li told me. ?Asians are held to different standards simply because of their race.?\n\nTo back his claim, he cites a 2005 study by Thomas J. Espenshade and Chang Y. Chung, both of Princeton, which concludes that if elite universities were to disregard race, Asians would fill nearly four of five spots that now go to blacks or Hispanics. Affirmative action has a neutral effect on the number of whites admitted, Mr. Li is arguing, but it raises the bar for Asians. The way Princeton selects its entering class, Mr. Li wrote in his complaint, ?seems to be a calculated move by a historically white institution to protect its racial identity while at the same time maintaining a facade of progressivism.?\n\nPrivate institutions can commit to affirmative action, even with state bans, but federal money could be revoked if they are found to be discriminating. Mr. Li is seeking suspension of federal financial assistance to Princeton. ?I?m not seeking anything personally,? he says. ?I?m happy at Yale. But I grew up thinking that in America race should not matter.?\n\nAdmissions officials have long denied that they apply quotas. Nonetheless, race is important ?to ensure a diverse student body,? says Cass Cliatt, a Princeton spokeswoman. But, she adds, ?Looking at the merits of race is not the same as the opposite? ? discrimination.\n\nElite colleges like Princeton review the ?total package,? in her words, looking at special talents, extracurricular interests and socioeconomics ? factors like whether the applicant is the first in the family to go to college or was raised by a single mother. ?There?s no set formula or standard for how we evaluate students,? she says. High grades and test scores would seem to be merely a baseline. ?We turned away approximately half of applicants with maximum scores on the SAT, all three sections,? Ms. Cliatt says of the class Mr. Li would have joined.\n\nIn the last two months, the nation has seen a number of new challenges to racial engineering in schools. In November, the United States Supreme Court heard a case questioning the legality of using race in assigning students to public schools in Seattle and Louisville, Ky. Voters are also sending a message, having thrown out racial preferences in Michigan in November, following a lead taken by California, Texas, Florida and Washington. Last month, Ward Connerly, the architect of Proposition 209, announced his next potential targets for a ballot initiative, including Arizona, Colorado, Missouri and Nebraska.\n\nWhen I ask the chancellor at Berkeley, Robert J. Birgeneau, if there is a perfect demographic recipe on this campus that likes to think of itself as the world?s finest public university ? Harvard on the Hill ? he demurs.\n\n?We are a meritocracy,? he says. And ? by law, he adds ? the campus is supposed to be that way. If Asians made up, say, 70 percent of the campus, he insists, there would still be no attempt to reduce their numbers.\n\nAsian enrollment at his campus actually began to ramp up well before affirmative action was banned.\n\nHistorically, Asians have faced discrimination, with exclusion laws in the 1800s that kept them from voting, owning property or legally immigrating. Many were run out of West Coast towns by mobs. But by the 1970s and ?80s, with a change in immigration laws, a surge in Asian arrivals began to change the complexion of California, and it was soon reflected in an overrepresentation at its top universities.\n\nIn the late 1980s, administrators appeared to be limiting Asian-American admissions, prompting a federal investigation. The result was an apology by the chancellor at the time, and a vow that there would be no cap on Asian enrollment.\n\nUniversity administrators and teachers use anguished words to describe what has happened since.\n\n?I?ve heard from Latinos and blacks that Asians should not be considered a minority at all,? says Elaine Kim, a professor of Asian-American studies at Berkeley. ?What happened after they got rid of affirmative action has been a disaster ? for blacks and Latinos. And for Asians it?s been a disaster because some people think the campus has become all-Asian.?\n\nThe diminishing number of African-Americans on campus is a consistent topic of discussion among black students. Some say they feel isolated, without a sense of community. ?You really do feel like you stand out,? says Armilla Staley, a second-year law student. In her freshman year, she was one of only nine African-Americans in a class of 265. ?I?m almost always the only black person in my class,? says Ms. Staley, who favors a return to some form of affirmative action.\n\n?Quite frankly, when you walk around campus, it?s overwhelmingly Asian,? she says. ?I don?t feel any tension between Asians and blacks, but I don?t really identify with the Asian community as a minority either.?\n\nWalter Robinson, the director of undergraduate admissions, who is African-American, has the same impression. ?The problem is that because we?re so few, we get absorbed among the masses,? he says.\n\nChancellor Birgeneau says he finds the low proportion of blacks and Hispanics appalling, and two years into his tenure, he has not found a remedy. To broaden the pool, the U.C. system promises to admit the top 4 percent at each high school in the state and uses ?comprehensive review? ? considering an applicant?s less quantifiable attributes. But the net results for a campus like Berkeley are disappointing. His university, Dr. Birgeneau says, loses talented black applicants to private universities like Stanford, where African-American enrollment was 10 percent last year ? nearly three times that at Berkeley.\n\n?I just don?t believe that in a state with three million African-Americans there is not a single engineering student for the state?s premier public university,? says the chancellor, who has called for reinstating racial preferences.\n\nOne leading critic of bringing affirmative action back to Berkeley is David A. Hollinger, chairman of its history department and author of ?Post-Ethnic America: Beyond Multiculturalism.? He supported racial preferences before Proposition 209, but is no longer so sure. ?You could argue that the campus is more diverse now,? because Asians comprise so many different cultures, says Dr. Hollinger. A little more than half of Asian freshmen at Berkeley are Chinese, the largest group, followed by Koreans, East-Indian/Pakistani, Filipino and Japanese.\n\nHe believes that Latinos are underrepresented because many come from poor agrarian families with little access to the good schools that could prepare them for the rigors of Berkeley. He points out that, on the other hand, many of the Korean students on campus are sons and daughters of parents with college degrees. In any event, he says, it is not the university?s job to fix the problems that California?s public schools produce.\n\nDr. Birgeneau agrees on at least one point: ?I think we?re now at the point where the category of Asian is not very useful. Koreans are different from people from Sri Lanka and they?re different than Japanese. And many Chinese-Americans are a lot like Caucasians in some of their values and areas of interest.?\n\nIF Berkeley is now a pure meritocracy, what does that say about the future of great American universities in the post-affirmative action age? Are we headed toward a day when all elite colleges will look something like Berkeley: relatively wealthy whites (about 60 percent of white freshmen?s families make $100,000 or more) and a large Asian plurality and everyone else underrepresented? Is that the inevitable result of color-blind admissions?\n\nEric Liu, author of ?The Accidental Asian: Notes of a Native Speaker? and a domestic policy adviser to former President Bill Clinton, is troubled by the assertion that the high Asian makeup of elite campuses reflects a post-racial age where merit prevails.\n\n?I really challenge this idea of a pure meritocracy,? says Mr. Liu, who runs mentoring programs that grew out of his book ?Guiding Lights: How to Mentor and Find Life?s Purpose.? Until all students ? from rural outposts to impoverished urban settings ? are given equal access to the Advanced Placement classes that have proved to be a ticket to the best colleges, then the idea of pure meritocracy is bunk, he says. ?They?re measuring in a fair way the results of an unfair system.?\n\nHe also says Asian-Americans are tired of having to live up to ? or defend ? ?that tired old warhorse of the model minority.?\n\n?We shouldn?t be calling these studying habits that help so many kids get into good schools ?Asian values,? ? says Mr. Liu, himself a product of Yale College and Harvard Law School. ?These are values that used to be called Jewish values or Anglo-Saxon work-ethic values. The bottom line message from the family is the same: work hard, defer gratification, share sacrifice and focus on the big goal.?\n\nHazel R. Markus lectures on this very subject as a professor of psychology at Stanford and co-director of its Research Institute for Comparative Studies in Race and Ethnicity. Her studies have found that Asian students do approach academics differently. Whether educated in the United States or abroad, she says, they see professors as authority figures to be listened to, not challenged in the back-and-forth Socratic tradition. ?You hear some teachers say that the Asian kids get great grades but just sit there and don?t participate,? she says. ?Talking and thinking are not the same thing. Being a student to some Asians means that it?s not your place to question, and that flapping your gums all day is not the best thing.?\n\nOne study at the institute looked at Asian-American students in lab courses, and found they did better solving problems alone and without conversations with other students. ?This can make for some big problems,? she says, like misunderstandings between classmates. ?But people are afraid to talk about these differences. And one of the fantastic opportunities of going to a Stanford or Berkeley is to learn something about other cultures, so we should be talking about it.?\n\nAs for the rise in Asian enrollment, the reason ?isn?t a mystery,? Dr. Markus says. ?This needs to come out and we shouldn?t hide it,? she says. ?In Asian families, the No. 1 job of a child is to be a student. Being educated ? that?s the most honorable thing you can do.?\n\nBERKELEY is ?Asian heaven,? as one student puts it. ?When I went back East my Asian friends were like, ?Wow, you go to Berkeley ? that must be great,? ? says Tera Nakata, who just graduated and now works in the residence halls.\n\nYou need only go to colleges in, say, the Midwest to appreciate the Asian feel of this campus. But Berkeley is freighted with the baggage of stereotypes ? that it is boring socially, full of science nerds, a hard place to make friends.\n\n?About half the students at this school spend their entire career in the library,? one person wrote in a posting on vault.com, a popular job and college search Web site.\n\nAnother wrote: ?Everyone who is white joins the Greek system and everyone who isn?t joins a ?theme house? or is a member of a club related to race.?\n\nThere is some truth to the image, students acknowledge, but it does not do justice to the bigger experience at Berkeley. ?You have the ability to stay with people who are like you and not get out of your comfort zone,? says Ms. Nakata. ?But I learned a lot by mixing it up. I lived in a dorm with a lot of different races, and we would have these deep conversations all the time about race and our feelings of where we belong and where we came from.? But she also says that the ?celebrate diversity aspect? of Berkeley doesn?t go deep. ?We want to respect everyone?s differences, but we don?t mix socially.?\n\nNear the end of my stay at Berkeley I met a senior, Jonathan Lee, the son of a Taiwanese father and a mother from Hong Kong. He grew up well east of Los Angeles, in the New America sprawl of fast-growing Riverside County, where his father owned a restaurant. He went to a high school where he was a minority.\n\n?When I was in high school,? he says, ?there was this notion that you?re Chinese, you must be really good in math.? But now Mr. Lee is likely to become a schoolteacher, much to the chagrin of his parents, ?who don?t think it will be very lucrative.?\n\nThe story of Jon Lee?s journey at Berkeley is compelling. As president of the Asian-American Association, he has tried to dispel stereotypes of ?the Dragon Lady seductress or the idea that everybody plays the piano.? His closest friends are in the club. It may seem that he has become more insular, that he has found his tribe. But Mr. Lee says he has been trying to lead other Asian students out of the university bubble. Once a week, they go into a mostly black and Hispanic middle school in the Bay Area to mentor students.\n\nFor the last five semesters, Mr. Lee has worked with one student. ?I take him out for dim sum, or to Chinatown, or just talk about college and what it?s like at Cal,? he says. ?We talk about race and we talk about everything. And he?s taught me a lot.?\n\nThe mentoring program came about not because of prodding by well-meaning advisers, teachers or student groups. It came about because Mr. Lee looked around at the new America ? in California, the first state with no racial majority ? and found that it looked very different from Berkeley. And much as he loves Berkeley, he knew that if he wanted to learn enough to teach, he needed to get off campus.\n\nTimothy Egan reports for The Times from the West Coast.

I thought I did a pretty good job. However, my teacher decided to give me a 65% and i was like WTH?!?!?!?!? He said that I didn't have any strategies and I'm pretty sure I did.  Here's the essay....he said that I can turn it in tomorrow and make whatever changes I need to and he'll give me back some points..... I don't know what to do because I did all I could :/ Can someone please help?\n\nAlexis De Tocqueville, who lived during the French Revolution, witnessed the instability and the chaos of his country; he was confronted with the problem of how the state and religion should relate. But as he visited America, he experienced a whole new social infrastructure that differed from that of his native France. As he compared and contrasted the political, social, and the general situations in France and America, he found two distinct make-ups of the church and state relationship and was able to discover the result of those situations. Tocqueville's observations, therefore, led him to argue in Democracy in America that religion is one of the main factors that is necessary for the maintenance of a democratic society. Tocqueville, In Democracy in America, argues that religion corrects many flaws of democracy- materialism, misuse of liberty, individualism, and the lack of stability- and also that the separation of church and state helps religion to maintain and even increase its dominant role in society.\nWhen Tocqueville contrasts France and America, the one important factor that he sees as creating a more beneficial religious situation in America than in France is the separation of church and state. Tocqueville believes that the neglecting of religion was the factor behind the French Revolution's failure and for the great political and social turmoil which followed. The revolutionaries did not realize that Christian beliefs were actually in line with their principles and could have aided their cause. During Tocqueville's travels in America, he found that the main reason for the great influence of religion over the country was the complete separation of church and state. As he investigated this further, he was surprised to find that the priests \"held no public appointments,\" that \"most of the clergy seemed voluntarily to steer clear of power,\" and that \"they were careful to keep clear of all parties.\" This was a huge contrast because to an 18th century Frenchman who was accustomed to the political interference of the Church, the attitudes of the clergy in America must have, indeed, seemed strange. However, what was even more surprising to Tocqueville was that \"by lessening the apparent power of religion one increases its real strength.\" What he came to make of this was that religion is not something that should be forced upon a people by the power of the government, but rather it should be something that the pe\nple willingly want to pursue themselves.\nThis philosophy has proven to be a very logical one, true even in today's society and of people in general; we tend to do things which we are told not to do. For example, a three year old toddler, when scolded by an authoritative figure to not perform a vulgar act or to not go outside without a parent or guardian, will quite often disregard what was just told to him and continue doing whatever he feels like. However, when an authoritative figure instructs the toddler gently, the toddler will, more likely than not, ponder what he was just told and yield to the authoritative figure's demands. The exact same phenomenon can be applied to the pursuit of religion by the people at their own wills. In contrast to the ''by lessening the apparent power of religion once increases its real strength'', \"religion is only one particular form of hope, and it is as natural to the human heart as hope itself. It is by a sort of intellectual deviation, and in a way by doing violence to their own nature, that men detach themselves from religious beliefs; an invincible alienation draws them back.\" This presents that religion is in itself a panacea and it is something that men can employ and take great advantage of. As a result of this natural religious inclination in man, separating the church from the state does not mitigate religion's force but actually tends to increase its strength in society.\nTocqueville asserts that religion?s most important role in our society is that of teaching people to use their liberties well. One of the most important ways in which religion fulfills this essential role is through its great influence on women.

I thought I did a pretty good job. However, my teacher decided to give me a 65% and i was like WTH?!?!?!?!? He said that I didn't have any strategies and I'm pretty sure I did. Here's the essay....he said that I can turn it in tomorrow and make whatever changes I need to and he'll give me back some points..... I don't know what to do because I did all I could :/ Can someone please help?\n\nAlexis De Tocqueville, who lived during the French Revolution, witnessed the instability and the chaos of his country; he was confronted with the problem of how the state and religion should relate. But as he visited America, he experienced a whole new social infrastructure that differed from that of his native France. As he compared and contrasted the political, social, and the general situations in France and America, he found two distinct make-ups of the church and state relationship and was able to discover the result of those situations. Tocqueville's observations, therefore, led him to argue in Democracy in America that religion is one of the main factors that is necessary for the maintenance of a democratic society. Tocqueville, In Democracy in America, argues that religion corrects many flaws of democracy- materialism, misuse of liberty, individualism, and the lack of stability- and also that the separation of church and state helps religion to maintain and even increase its dominant role in society.\nWhen Tocqueville contrasts France and America, the one important factor that he sees as creating a more beneficial religious situation in America than in France is the separation of church and state. Tocqueville believes that the neglecting of religion was the factor behind the French Revolution's failure and for the great political and social turmoil which followed. The revolutionaries did not realize that Christian beliefs were actually in line with their principles and could have aided their cause. During Tocqueville's travels in America, he found that the main reason for the great influence of religion over the country was the complete separation of church and state. As he investigated this further, he was surprised to find that the priests \"held no public appointments,\" that \"most of the clergy seemed voluntarily to steer clear of power,\" and that \"they were careful to keep clear of all parties.\" This was a huge contrast because to an 18th century Frenchman who was accustomed to the political interference of the Church, the attitudes of the clergy in America must have, indeed, seemed strange. However, what was even more surprising to Tocqueville was that \"by lessening the apparent power of religion one increases its real strength.\" What he came to make of this was that religion is not something that should be forced upon a people by the power of the government, but rather it should be something that the pe\nple willingly want to pursue themselves.\nThis philosophy has proven to be a very logical one, true even in today's society and of people in general; we tend to do things which we are told not to do. For example, a three year old toddler, when scolded by an authoritative figure to not perform a vulgar act or to not go outside without a parent or guardian, will quite often disregard what was just told to him and continue doing whatever he feels like. However, when an authoritative figure instructs the toddler gently, the toddler will, more likely than not, ponder what he was just told and yield to the authoritative figure's demands. The exact same phenomenon can be applied to the pursuit of religion by the people at their own wills. In contrast to the ''by lessening the apparent power of religion once increases its real strength'', \"religion is only one particular form of hope, and it is as natural to the human heart as hope itself. It is by a sort of intellectual deviation, and in a way by doing violence to their own nature, that men detach themselves from religious beliefs; an invincible alienation draws them back.\" This presents that religion is in itself a panacea and it is something that men can employ and take great advantage of. As a result of this natural religious inclination in man, separating the church from the state does not mitigate religion's force but actually tends to increase its strength in society.\nTocqueville asserts that religion?s most important role in our society is that of teaching people to use their liberties well. One of the most important ways in which religion fulfills this essential role is through its great influence on women. Tocqueville claims that because men are marred by avarice and ambitions, religion is unable to restrain them; However, he says that ''religion reigns supreme in the souls of women, and it is women who shape mores.''\nTocqueville's analysis in the chapters dealing with religion demonstrates that religion is one of the critical forces that helps to preserve the democratic societies. Considering his comprehensive and lengthy treatment of religion and his constant approbation for its benefits, it is feasible to claim that in Tocqueville's opinion religion is the most important and necessary element in any democracy; It corrects democratic societies at their weakest points, and helps the society to run more smoothly in both private and political matters, and also helps the denizens of a society to lead happier and more fulfilling lives.

But the rapid pace of technological innovation and the split second processing capabilities of computers that can work virtually nonstop have made all of us feel rushed. We have adopted the relentless pace of the very machines that were supposed to simplify our lives, with the result that, whether at work or play, people do not feel like their lives have changed for the better.\n\nassignment: do changes that make our lives easier not necessarily make them better?\n\nMY ESSAY\nI have frequently found myself wishing that \"life were easier\", a sentiment that most people have some time in their life. However, I am not proud of this thought because I know that an easier time does not necessarily mean a better time. making changes to save effort often compromises the end result; the product will lose the personal toudh, as well as bring on a slew of other problems.\n\nPeople started to shirk work from a very early time, and they developed the concept of slaves and servants. The theory was that menial tasks could be delegated to lesser beings while the rich could enjoy a leisurely lifestyle and deal with issues of more importance. In the pre-civil war south, plantation owners could sit back and increase their bank accounts while slaves labored in the cotton fields and servants tended to the children. The result is the brutality we are all familiar with and a wobbly economy dependant solely on the slave's labor. many ladies also escaped the responsibility of raising their own children by hiring nannies; obviously while they were free to look beautiful and do nothing, they also could not cultivate their personal relationship with their children. This so-called easy life was impersonal, and we now recognize it as evil\n\nIn the modren age, people have also developed numerous technology that seeks to benefit efficiency and entertainment. people almost cannot survive without the ipod and laptop at hand. We spend massive amounts of money on new gadgets as well as a great party of the day making updates and doing maintenance. therefore, the idea that it actually saves time no longer stands. In fact, we devote much more time to these machines than to meaningful tasks.\n\nmany of the better things in life require hard work, one's own devotion acannot be replaced with another's unless one will settle for a worse result.\n\n\nThanks for reading! again, please be brutal in scoring; also specific comments would be greatly appreciated!

Her brother is already a college JR.\n\nHer biological father is paying child support now, roughly $600 a month for her.  That will end the day she graduates HS, as she'll turn 18 in April.  We live in PA, and in PA there is no requirement for child support to continue after HS and no requirement that he do anything for her the day after she is our of HS.  The exception is that he must keep them both on his health insurance until they cease to be full time students.\n\nHere's my question.  For her 1st year of college, the FAFSA considers child support as an income source for the custodial parents which will be for 2008.  It's not hard to see that during 2009 there will be a decrease of about $4000 in our family's income as a result of the end of child support.  The problem is that this doesn't happen until long after the financial aid is given.  Since often schools tend to award the same grants if things stay relatively similar in the household income, has anyone gotten a better package after the actual child support ceased?  In reality, by our household income will decrease by about $4000 next year and another $3000 in 2010, not accounting for any raises I might get.  That is a significant amount to us after taxes.  Our family of 7 is well under $75K combining all income right now.  Additionaly, my health insurance premium is going to go from $120 a month to about $260/mo for next year.  I know most all schools have special exception applications, but has anyone actually gone through with this and seen an increase in aid based on a newly calculated EFC as a result of child support?\n\nStep-D's real dad will not be contributing a penny for college.  I'm OK with that, because as far as I am concerned, she's my D.  The Profile schools raise a whole different level of problems, but I figured I'd start here with the basics first.  Real dad makes about $35K a year with overtime as a laborer in a scrap yard, so no big money being hidden anywhere.  Still, a Profile school expecting anything from him will sink her because we're already being gapped with step-S a significant amount.  We can't make up a gap from a profile school that figures he's good for another $7K.  She has no contact with him, and I doubt he'll even fill out the forms.

Here it is, finally:\n\nDear Primab:\n\nYour dilemma is not unusual. Bright, academically-inclined students are often torn between the BFA and the BA degree. The BFA offers pre-professional training and (perhaps) a quicker route into the profession, but at the cost of a broad liberal arts education and in-depth study of other fields. The BA offers the latter, but will likely not provide time for the essential work on the voice and the body. So how to decide on the best path?\n\nFirst, some clarification. A Bachelor of Fine Arts (BFA) degree is typically around 60-70% of the total curriculum, with the remaining 30-40% in general studies and electives. Here, for example, is the breakdown of our BFA in Acting (using the categories established by NAST, the National Association of Schools of Theatre):\n\nActing, Voice, Movement, and Performance: 33%\nSupportive Courses in Theatre: 29%\nGeneral Studies: 29%\nElectives: 8%\n\nAnd here is the breakdown of our BFA in Musical Theatre:\n\nMusical Theatre (Voice, Acting, Performance): 35%\nDance and Movement: 9%\nSupportive Courses in Music and Theatre: 27%\nGeneral Studies: 29%\n\nOur BFA degrees are fairly similar to those at Michigan, NYU, and Penn State, among others, where there are significant general education requirements. Pure conservatory programs (CCM, Boston Conservatory) have fewer requirements in general education.\n\nBy comparison, a Bachelor of Arts degree (BA) is typically around 30% of the curriculum, with the remaining 70% divided between general education and electives (Including other majors). Here is the breakdown of our BA in Theatre:\n\nTheatre Studies: 20%\nPerformance and Theatre Electives: 10%\nGeneral Education: 41% (more because of math and foreign language)\nElectives: 29%\n\nIt should be immediately obvious that the BA degree offers a much greater degree of flexibility in the program. It also has a lot more \"free\" time. I just looked at the schedules for our freshman BA majors, BFA Acting majors, and BFA Musical Theatre/Dance majors next year. All of them have 18 credit hours, the maximum allowed without paying an overload fee. (We're on the quarter system, three 10-week terms in an academic year. Schools on the semester system--two 15-week terms in an academic year--typically require 12 credit hours per term.) Eighteen hours sounds reasonable in a 40-hour week, because it leaves 22 hours of research and reading and thinking and preparation time for those 18 hours in class.\n\nAh, but contact hours don't necessarily match credit hours, and especially not for BFA programs. Our BA majors next year will spend 19 hours in class for those 18 credits. Sounds just about right. But our Acting majors will spend 31 hours in class, and our Musical Theatre/Dance majors will spend 39 hours in class for 18 credits. That means that songs and monologues get learned, scenes rehearsed and papers written in the evenings (if you're not in rehearsal) or in the late evenings (if you are in rehearsal). For some, that's a desirable lifestyle; for others, it would be hell not having time to think.\n\nSo which is right for you? Try answering the following questions by circling the appropriate number from 1 to 5, where 1 = strongly disagree and 5 = strongly agree. (Ignore for the moment whether it's a positive or negative number.)\n\nI can't imagine doing anything besides acting in the professional theatre. Really.\n1 2 3 4 5\n\nI am a singer and a dancer, and I would love to spend my life doing musicals.\n1 2 3 4 5\n\nI want to learn everything about everything.\n-1 -2 -3 -4 -5\n\nExcept for being onstage, my favorite place is the library or my room, curled up with a great book.\n-1 -2 -3 -4 -5\n\nExcept for being onstage, my favorite place is in dance class, or acting class, or choir.\n1 2 3 4 5\n\nI'm very physical, and I'm at my best when I'm active and busy all the time.\n1 2 3 4 5\n\nI'm very intellectual, and I'm at my best when I have time to think and write.\n-1 -2 -3 -4 -5\n\nOK, now add up your score, and now pay attention to whether it's a positive or negative number. If I've counted right, the scores can range from -11 to +17. This may be the most unscientific questionnaire ever created, but my suspicion is that if your score is in the high positive numbers, you're going to be happy in a BFA program and unhappy in a BA program; and vice versa, if your score is in the negative numbers, you're going to happier in a BA than in a BFA program. As I said, it's a guess. If there's someone out there who's a psychologist, and wants to help me do a study, give me a call.\n\nBut is a BA program going to lead to a career in acting? I decided to look at the backgrounds of the 2004 Tony winners for acting. Here are the results:\n\nLeading Actress\nPlay: Phylicia Rashad, BFA, Howard University\nMusical: Idina Menzel, BFA, New York University\n\nLeading Actor\nPlay: Jefferson Mays, BA, Yale University; MFA, U. California San Diego\nMusical: Hugh Jackman, BA (Journalism), University of Technology, Sydney, Australia; Certificate (equivalent of our MFA) Western Australian Academy of Performing Arts\n\nFeatured Actress\nPlay: Audra McDonald, BM (Voice), Juilliard\nMusical: Anika Noni Rose, (unknown undergraduate); MFA, American Conservatory Theatre\n\nFeatured Actor\nPlay: Brian F. O'Bryne, unknown\nMusical: Michael Cerveris, BA (unknown major), Yale\n\nI also looked at biographies of Meryl Streep and Robin Williams, two of the most gifted actors I know. Streep went to Vassar, where she did a BA in English, then did an MFA at Yale. Williams started out at Claremont Men's College (now Claremont McKenna) studying political science, got interested in improvisation, transferred briefly to College of Marin, then won a full scholarship to Juilliard. He spent two years there, but then, at John Houseman's suggestion, he left before finishing the degree and moved to LA to do stand-up comedy. (Excellent biographies of these two and others have been written by Dominic Wills and are available at ww.tiscali.co.uk/entertainment/film/biographies.)\n\nThere are a couple of different conclusions one might draw from this incredibly brief survey. One is that intensive professional training in music or theatre is essential. With the exception of Cerveris, all have either BFA or MFA degrees or their equivalent. And Cerveris' biography states that he studied classical voice at Yale.\n\nBut another observation might be that an undergraduate BA degree, or at least some years spent studying something besides acting, may also be very important. I find it fascinating that both Mays and Cerveris attended Yale, which doesn't have an undergraduate degree in Theatre; Streep majored in English at Vassar; Jackman majored in Journalism; and even Willliams spent some time studying political science. I don't think any of them would say that those years were wasted.\n\nThe conclusion might be, finally, that while intensive training is critical to success in our field, the real question is not whether, but WHEN. If you have no interest in academics, aren't going to be happy unless you're in class and rehearsal at least eight hours a day, then you should do a BFA in dance or theatre or a BM in music. But if you love academics, want to study everything, need quiet time to read and write and think, then you may well want to do a BA degree in any subject at a school where you can act as much as you want, and obtain a better sense of yourself and the world before you commit yourself to the intensive professional training which an MFA requires. The middle ground, which works for some, is a BFA program that requires or at least encourages a significant amount of work in fields besides voice, dance, movement and acting.\n\nI hope this gets you a little closer to knowing what you want to do. I'd urge you to look at several kinds of programs, a liberal arts college with a terrific theatre program that allows open participation from anyone in the college (or a major university with several theatre clubs open to everyone); a respected conservatory with intensive professional training; and a school with a mixture of professional training and liberal arts education. I think you'll discover fairly quickly from the students themselves which kind of program is the best fit for you.\n\nThere are many ways to succeed in our business, Primab, but finally you have to do it in the way which makes you the happiest. Too many people are successful in their fields, but miserable doing it. You don't have to end up that way. You can make a better choice.\n\nGood luck.\n\nBy Primab (Primab) on Monday, June 14, 2004 - 11:21 pm: Edit \n\nI don't even know where to begin. Thank you for that amazing post. That took a lot of your time and I am certain you will help not just me but many on this site with a similar dilemma. I am new to CC so I don't know which school you are speaking of when you talk about \"our\" BFA, etc. Can you tell us?\n\nWhile I know that theater will be my life-I am inclined to go for the BA-majoring in theater- and follow with a BFA in acting (I don't aspire to do musical theater). The reason being is I want to make sure I have something to fall back on since the career path for an actor is always risky. I still have time to decide.\n\nI am visitng schools this month with, hopefully, strong BA's in theater (Bard, Vassar, Brown, Amherst and Boston College). I have visited Northwestern and USC already. Any suggestions would be really welcome.\n\nMy heartfelt thanks to you for taking the time and energy to post that. I haven't taken the \"test\" yet but will now. Maybe you are right and the BFA is the way to go.\n\nI look forward to reading more from you.\n\nBy Primab (Primab) on Monday, June 14, 2004 - 11:26 pm: Edit \n\nDoctorjohn-I just clicked on your name and see that you are the Chair of Otterbein's theater dept. It's wonderful that you are here to help those of us at CC interested in theater. I am really awed! Thanks again for the great advise!\n\nBy Valerie (Valerie) on Tuesday, June 15, 2004 - 02:15 am: Edit \n\nI'm grateful too, Doctorjohn. What a great informative post! I love the survey questions too. What if someone's numbers come out almost even instead of a majority of +'s or -'s?\n\nBy Doctorjohn (Doctorjohn) on Tuesday, June 15, 2004 - 07:21 am: Edit \n\nPrimab: I'm glad you found the post helpful. My suspicion is that a BA followed by an MFA (that's what you meant to write) is the route to go for you. The schools that you've listed (Bard, Vassar, etc.) are certainly terrific places. When you visit, ask about performance opportunities, and not just through the Theatre Department, if there is one. Many of the old-line Eastern schools have drama clubs which produce theatre on a very high level. Some major universities do as well. Extra-curricular theatre at one of these schools can be just as valid a route as doing a BA.\n\nValerie: I don't know. Never done this before. And any social scientist would take me to task for the questionnaire, I'm sure. My guess is that if the numbers come out almost even, the student might be happiest in a BA program which offered at least some acting classes, as well as the possibility of studying voice; or in a BFA program which made room for significant study of other fields. I think I need to show the survey to some of my colleagues, tweak it and field test it. In the meantime, I'd love to hear results from people!\n\nBy Jrmom (Jrmom) on Tuesday, June 15, 2004 - 11:38 am: Edit \n\nOh dear, I got a +9 when I plugged in the numbers that I'm pretty sure my jr would have put in. What does that mean?\n\nUnfortunately, a kid can love to be alone and read widely for the sake of, and the joy of, reading - love quiet time for reading, thinking and writing, but still really DISLIKE being in a wide range of school classes and strongly prefer performance classes to liberal arts classes.\n\nMaybe the one question on this be two questions?\n\n1) Except for being onstage, my favorite place is the library or my room, curled up with a great book AND I enjoy studying all subjects in class\n\n2) Except for being onstage, my favorite place is the library or my room, curled up with a great book BUT I strongly prefer reading widely on my own to taking a broad range of classes in school\n\n\nI would suspect this student, despite scoring a 9, would be unhappy in a BA and thrive in a BFA, but not because of any dislike of being along to read, think and write.\n\nThis is an interesting process. Can't wait to hear what your colleagues say about the questionnaire!\n\nBy Alwaysamom (Alwaysamom) on Tuesday, June 15, 2004 - 11:56 am: Edit \n\nJrmom, I took the survey and answered how I believe my D would have and came up with a 1. Although it's kind of a fun concept, I hope that students don't rely on those questions to help them make a decision between a BFA or BA program. I know that my daughter is as passionate as anyone about her performing and love of drama but she is equally passionate about other things. She's actually a very well-rounded kid and from my experience with her friends that she went to an arts high school with and also her friends at Tisch, they are very similar. Many are also gifted writers, musicians, athletes, math contest winners. I hope no one is being discouraged from a BFA program because they want to be able to get a good academic education as well. Certainly at Tisch, you can, and are encouraged to, do both. Most of my D's friends will double major in the College of Arts and Science. I suspect that this is the reason that academics is equally weighted in the admissions process. There are many options for our kids who love drama and it's important that they research all of them in order to find one which is the best fit for them, and for all aspects of their lives.\n\nBy Jrmom (Jrmom) on Tuesday, June 15, 2004 - 01:00 pm: Edit \n\nI have a lot of questions today....\n\nDoes anyone know if a kid who has not had a lot of music background (main training in acting, dance and voice in that order; no theory, no sight-singing courses yet)should even bother to apply to a music based MT program like NYU Steinhart?\n\nBy Jrmom (Jrmom) on Tuesday, June 15, 2004 - 01:01 pm: Edit \n\nWhoops, I posted in the wrong area! It's hard when there are two such interesting conversations going...:-)\n\nBy Soozievt (Soozievt) on Tuesday, June 15, 2004 - 04:18 pm: Edit \n\nAlwaysamom, I agree with you. A kid can be extremely passionate about a life in the theater and love doing theater 24/7, but also happen to have other interests or talents. I have a daughter who sounds a bit like your Emily. She definitely wants to pursue musical theater and it has been a deep seated passion since nursery school. There has been no doubt in her mind about going for a BFA in musical theater for years. However, she happens to also be a very good student and has some other talents/skills. I think an attribute of Tisch is how you can have a conservatory experience, yet also study some liberal arts. I think my D is realizing that is likely what she would thrive on, even though at one time she thought a school that was almost all performing arts courses sounded ideal but being able to do a bit of other interests and get some education is now attractive to her as well, even though her prime love is musical theater.\n\nJrmom....I can just give you my opinion but don't go by what I say, ok? But my feeling is that even in any MT program, voice skills/training, as well as some music background, is going to be a very important. Afterall, singing is a major part of the audition. Then for a place like Steinhardt which is a music school, it is even more significant. In fact, I would imagine at Steinhardt that most students will have had voice training, including some classical singing. For instance, just to audition for All States for voice here, you have to sing classical and have to sight read, etc. I think most students involved in music in high school have this general background. Also since it is so competitive for MT college programs (not talking just Steinhardt now), that most kids who get in likely have some voice training. For example, a good friend of my girls' who is graduating high school this week loves musical theater and auditioned for MT college programs. She has done a LOT of theater, but mostly is cast in ensemble roles. I would say her best skill is dance, where she has had the most training. She only started taking voice lessons maybe 18 months ago (though is in choir things in HS and the musicals and such). She did not get into any of the BFA programs at all. She is a decent singer but not the best. She is going to Indiana University to pursue musical theater but that is a BA program and no audition, plus she had some connections there. Her mom was just telling me that she felt her daughter was at a disadvantage in the vocal area as other auditioners had vocal training. I happen to agree with her. If you think about it, if a program is only taking 5% of the kids who try out, and many are very very good, it is likely the kids who are the best singers and actors who get in and likely these are the kids who might have gotten leads in their hometowns...sort of like the top 5% of kids from each area so to speak. I can't say if music skills are required to go to these schools but it cannot hurt to have a music background. As you can see for Steinhardt, they even mention this. I think even at UMichigan, there is a music theory or piano portion. I believe that the study of music and instruments has been beneficial to my daughter's singing/theater work, even though she does not study music/instruments for that reason but has always played a few. But I can see how it likely has helped in this area too. She can sight read anything. I believe once this actually got her cast.\n\nIn any case, if your daughter has not begun some voice lessons, she may want to as it will be very helpful to her as she prepares for auditions. Like your D, mine does a ton of dance but I have this feeling that that is not the main component of the MT college auditions but could enhance her candidacy since not all singers/actors can dance. But I definitely believe that singing is a big part of the audition for MT. In fact, in many major auditions, such as for Broadway, the first cut is singing only. If you make it past that, then you do the reading and dance. That has been our experience. So, I think you should definitely be aware that vocal skills will be paramount and then at Steinhardt, music skills will be as well. These places are so selective that even IF you have all that stuff, it is still hard to get in. I think one would be at a disadvantage with no music or vocal training. That is just my view but I am not as experienced as many who post here so take it with just a grain of salt of one mom to another ;-).\n\nSusan\n\nBy Doctorjohn (Doctorjohn) on Tuesday, June 15, 2004 - 06:01 pm: Edit \n\nWell, it's clear that the survey needs tweaking. Any and all suggestions are welcome.\n\nI agree with Alwaysamom that I'd hate to see anyone dissuaded from looking at BFA programs because of a score on a questionnaire. But all BFA programs are not alike, and few permit the double-majors that Tisch seems to encourage. Students who want both professional training and a strong academic education need to search out the programs that support this approach philosophically and practically.\n\nJrmom, what I hear is that answering the survey led to a realization that your daughter wants to read on her own, and doesn't want to be in a wide range of classes. If that's the case, she almost certainly wants to do a BFA, and might well be happy with a more conservatory approach. But Alwaysamom, your score of 1 suggests to me that your daughter really needs to be in a program like Tisch's, where all of her intellectual and artistic needs can be satisfied.\n\nHope this helps.\n\nBy Valerie (Valerie) on Tuesday, June 15, 2004 - 06:42 pm: Edit \n\nDoctorjohn, I asked my S to answer your questionnaire. His score came to .5 so he round it off to a 0. I asked him to share his thoughts.\n\nHe said because he had a performing arts H.S. background and intense study of Theatre and MT, (with other experiences he has had since he was 6 in the theatre world) his selection of a BFA vs. BA would depend on the program and course of study with any one school. In other words, he has found in his search for colleges that there is a variance of instruction and programs offered per school whether they are BFA or BA concentrated. One school could have a better BA program vs. another school's BFA program etc.\n\nHis college route was not only intnese but laborous because of this attitude and search for the best fit. Although, in the end he is Absolutely delighted with his choice of the BA program at UCLA, It needs to be said, that it was without a doubt a difficult decision (other than parental financial ability) to make vs. accepting a highly rated BFA at Tisch. Because as he said, his preference in general is a BFA.\n\nI find it interesting though that his score of 0 reflects his overall attitude and many interests that he indeed will be persuing a BA route of education.\n\nWe just recently returned from a visit to UCLA and it's theatre program and I beleive it has confirmed his decision as being the best fit for him. UCLA will give him in the long run the best of all with a (1)concentrated track of Theatre study after freshman year if wanted and accepted into. (2)A BA cirriculum where he can pull and major from a number of courses from All schools and their disciplines of his various interests and strenghts (3)The flexibility to produce and direct his own work after first semester of freshman year (4) his ability to persure private acting and voice classes on the side if wanted when time available (5)the ability to audition and do his own gigs, and (6)to wrap many things and experiences into one by college graduation. He will no doubt continue his pursuit of many subjects, things and other opportunities through his summers whether here or abroad too.\n\nI asked him if he was thinking of continuing his education to the graduate level at this time and he said no. It is his belief that he would like to go out in the world and make something of himself or of his own after graduation before he returns to the classroom for a concentration in a graduate level degree, if ever needed. Of course, he said it all depends. That things could change completely in the next four years if not before.\n\nBut, I get the distinct impression that he is ready NOW (and that it is important to him) to be \"the captain of his own ship\".\n\nSo, I think your questionaire is more on than off or closer in defining what a student would be accessing and thinking subconsciously than not. Work out a few kinks with your associates and I think you are on to something of great value for the student and his family in accessing BFA/BA college tracks and their educational future.\n\nI know my H and I feel better that S is persuing the right track that has been chosen. Your questionnaire has supported that.\n\nBy Thesbohemian (Thesbohemian) on Tuesday, June 15, 2004 - 10:17 pm: Edit \n\nI'm a 6 when I include the MT question and a 5 of up to 12 without it. I can sing pretty and I'm trainable as a dancer, but MT aint my thang.\n\nBy Doctorjohn (Doctorjohn) on Wednesday, June 16, 2004 - 10:28 pm: Edit \n\nValerie: Based on several of your earlier posts, I'd thought for a long time that your son had made a good choice. I think NYU would have been fine, but I suspect UCLA will be terrific for him.\n\nThesbo: I think that score supports what you've written before, that even though you do exceptionally well in academic subjects, that's not what you want to spend your time working on in college. That's why you're taking all those AP tests, right? Clearly you want a professional training program.\n\nOK, enough of the silly questionnaire. But let me explain some of the reasoning behind it.\n\nSuccess in the musical theatre requires continuous training in voice at least, and for most, in dance as well. You can't put that training on hold. So I do think that for students who want to do musicals, a BFA is preferable.\n\nIt's different for students who want to do regional theatre, Shakespeare festivals, off-Broadway, and even film. Unless they are ingenues, and therefore employable at the age of 22, it may be awhile, even four or five years, before they start getting cast regularly. Those years may be usefully spent in an MFA program, and there are many excellent ones, including NYU, Yale, ACT, and UC San Diego. These schools accept students who've majored in History as well as those who've majored in Theatre. And by the time they've finished the degree at the age of 25, MFA students have mature bodies and voices capable of doing classical repertoire. (They also have a \"terminal\" degree which will allow them later in life to teach at the college level.)\n\nToo, it's difficult to get what's commonly called a \"liberal arts education\" outside of an undergraduate setting. Professional training in a good MFA program can be done at the age of 30 or even 40. But there are no graduate programs in general studies. it's very difficult to go back at that age and spend the time studying philosophy, history, the arts and science. So, for some, doing an academically rigorous BA degree in theatre and another field, followed by an MFA in Acting, may be the better route. At least some students should consider it, and not reject it out-of-hand because they fear they can't adequately prepare for a professional acting career in any other way than a BFA.\n\nBut the BFA is absolutely right for many, and especially for students who want a career in musical theatre, as well as for those who are kinesthetic learners.\n\nIt's all about finding the path where you can learn the things you want to learn in the way you can best learn them.

Now I'm faced with a major decision. The idiots in my school's administration have expanded their already oppressive residence life rules to the point that they now essentially constitute the entire student body being \"grounded\" for the entire academic year. Me and several of my friends, all student leaders, are seriously considering withdrawing in protest and returning to our regular high schools. I've found this summer that I can get similar training through adult studio classes and private voice and speech lessons. I've also been extended an offer to join the local Shakespeare company, so I don't think I'll suffer too badly in my growth as an actress. What concerns me more is how withdrawing from what is viewed as a semi-prestigious school might look on my college applications and how it might effect academic scholarship opportunities. I'm also wondering what the best way to approach this subject will be in audition and scholarship interviews. If doctorjohn, the admissions reps in hiding, or any of you moms can provide some insight or have any advice, I'd appreciate it. I have a week to make my decision.\n\nBy Doctorjohn (Doctorjohn) on Saturday, July 31, 2004 - 06:21 am: Edit \n\nThesbo:\n\nI can't speak for other schools, but I know that for us, it's all about the audition. Getting into arts programs--whether theatre, music or dance--may be among the most democratic processes in existence. In the performing arts, there are no privileged admissions based on who your family is, or how much money they have, or where your parents went to college, or where you went to high school. Admission isn't based on your great SAT scores, grades, extra-curriculars, and college essays (although those are helpful). It isn't even about what you've done in the past. It's all about what we see right now in the four minutes you have onstage.\n\nWhile you're auditioning, we will look at your resume, and probably attribute your good work in part to the training you received. In the interview, I might ask you why you left \"Prestigious Performing Arts High School\". But it's more a matter of curiosity than a decision-making question. If you told me the truth--without the dramatic embellishment--that after some years in a residential high school devoted to the performing arts, you were feeling more than slightly imprisoned, and you wanted the freedom and diversity that you could find in your public high school, I would probably think you were pretty smart.\n\nIt's not unlike searching for a new job, Thesbo. Employers interview all the time, and one of the questions they always ask is why the prospective employee wants to leave her current position. If the prospect says that she has learned as much as she can in her job, and she's looking for new challenges, the employer is likely to take a chance on that prospect. But if the prospect says that she hates her current boss, that he's just stupid, and so is the whole organization, the employer isn't going to take a chance. Why not? Because most of us have learned through painful experience that people bring their negativity with them. If the prospect thinks those things about her current boss, she's going to think them about me. Doesn't matter that I'm a nicer guy than her current boss, even if that's the truth. The prospect will find some way to recreate her current psychological environment, where she's the victim and I'm the persecutor, in my business. And I can't afford that. Been there.\n\nSo, yes, it does matter how you frame what you say about why you left. But in this case, not nearly as much as the audition. If you and the others are pretty sure that you can be as well-prepared for the auditions next January by working with local professionals as you would be if you stayed in school and worked with the faculty, then leaving is certainly an option. It doesn't matter how it looks. To paraphrase the 1994 Clinton campaign, \"It's the audition, stupid.\"\n\nBut if you're not so sure that you can be as well prepared for auditions, then I worry that you're shooting yourself in the foot. If the faculty at Prestigious are the best available, do you really want to throw away what they can do to help you get ready? I guess I'm encouraging you to be selfish in a different kind of way, Thesbo. What's more important to you, dating or acting? Of course you want both. We all want a life. And if you can get both by leaving, then do it. But if you can't, then you have to make a choice.\n\nBut before you make the leap, I need to ask if you think you've exhausted your political options. Yes, you can walk out. You could also sit in (although I wouldn't recommend it). But have the six of you thought of asking for a collective meeting with the administration to see if you can get them to bend? If you do that, you have to be prepared to leave school. But you're thinking about doing that anyway. Why just walk away in a huff, which is a fairly meaningless gesture, when you can use the fact that you're prepared to leave, and so are others, as a collective bargaining tool? Does one of you have a supportive parent who's an attorney, who would be willing to help you with this?\n\nMy suspicion is that the \"idiots in the administration\" made the decision they did in order to protect the school from being sued, and they probably were advised by legal counsel that they had to do it this way. So one good attorney deserves another. I happen to be one of the few people who think lawyers do some good in the world. Not necessarily when they fight to win at all costs, but when they fight to find the best solution to a problem, through negotiation. So find an attorney who can help you guys negotiate a middle ground, where you can get at least some of what you want, the administration can get at least some of what it wants, and everyone can go on with the work of making theatre.\n\nAnd if you want some help with this, call me.\n\nBy Thesbohemian (Thesbohemian) on Saturday, July 31, 2004 - 12:10 pm: Edit \n\nThanks, Doctorjohn!\nRight now, there are 28 seniors and a good number of their parents involved in this and the number is growing as word spreads. I didn\u0092t realize it, but the residence people have gone too far in the past and a mass outcry to the president of the school did cause them to back down. A couple of the involved parents are lawyers and they are trying to find out if there is any real legal reason for the new rules. More likely than not, it\u0092s just a couple of the RL people overreacting to a small number of rebellious students who caused some trouble at the end of last year. They\u0092ve been known to do that. They were literally employees at the state\u0092s youth correctional facility before they got their current jobs and they still act like prison guards. The result is that a student body made up of artistically and often academically gifted students, most of whom have absolutely no prior disciplinary records, have sometimes found themselves being treated like criminals as a matter of course. Actually, this treatment has caused a lot of rebellion that wouldn\u0092t have otherwise occurred. Another side effect has been that a lot of students who have been recruited for the school have turned it down because of the overly restrictive rules. This is a matter of \u0093In Loco Parentis\u0094 truly becoming \u0093Loco Parents\u0094 and a lot of the actual parents seem to agree. My mom's comment is that \"There was a war with the stupid people and the stupid people won.\" LOL There is a petition being circulated which will be signed by both students and their parents. Hopefully the administration will see the light when faced with a large portion of the senior class, many of whom are bound for prestigious colleges, withdrawing. At any rate, I\u0092d like to return, but I\u0092m not going to spend my senior year of high school in \u0093lockdown\u0094 for anything short of them bringing Stanislavski back to life and somehow getting him to teach there.\n\nIf they don\u0092t back down, I think I\u0092ll be okay. The person I\u0092ve been working with this summer is a Ph.D. candidate with an MFA from SMU. We have good chemistry and I think I can trust her to get me ready for auditions. Some of the question here becomes whether or not I\u0092d benefit more from performing with adult companies as the \u0093designated ing\u00e9nue\u0094 and getting most of my training in private and through adult workshops or receiving more true conservatory model training where I\u0092ll likely be more stretched. Right now, the roles on the table are Bianca in \u0093Taming of the Shrew\u0094 and Renee/Tracy in \u0093Vampire Lesbians of Sodom.\u0094 I actually haven\u0092t gotten around to reading that play yet, but I\u0092ve heard it\u0092s a riot. Some of the people from the scene study class I took are planning to put it on this fall and would like to cast me for it. Of course, another factor is that performing a lot at night outside of school will make keeping my grades up a challenge. Mom has always thought the administration at my school are idiots and has never understood why I wanted to subject myself to them to begin with. So, she's willing to let me do this as long as I keep my grades up. As far as the dating versus acting choice, I do have a new boyfriend, but the poor guy is probably going to feel neglected no matter which option I choose! He'll probably dump me by November. LOL\n\nHopefully your thoughtful responses to the personal problems I keep spewing on this board will give others some valuable insight into the admissions process. Thanks again!\n\nBy Alwaysamom (Alwaysamom) on Saturday, July 31, 2004 - 12:33 pm: Edit \n\nThesbohemian, while Doctorjohn gives excellent advice, I would simply add that some arts programs do, indeed, consider your academic stats just as important as your audition. So, I suppose it depends on which schools you're interested in applying to this fall. I'm not familiar with which ones you're looking at, but I imagine that you know how each makes its admissions decisions. If, as you say, you're also interested in a merit scholarship for academics, then this becomes an even more relevant discussion. I would think that as long as your switch to another high school would include your being able to continue a rigorous curriculum academically, and that you maintain your high grades, then I doubt it would pose a problem in the admissions process. Although my daughter attended an arts h/s, most of her classmates at Tisch did not, so it will not work against you for one year. If you feel that you have the wherewithal to prepare for your auditions adequately without the resources available at your school, then you should be fine. Good luck!\n\nBy Doctorjohn (Doctorjohn) on Saturday, July 31, 2004 - 02:25 pm: Edit \n\nAlwaysamom: Agreed. Completely.\n\nGood luck,Thesbo. For the sake of your fellow students, who likely don't have the same access you do to good help outside the school, I hope the administration does back down.\n\nBy Bookiemom (Bookiemom) on Sunday, August 01, 2004 - 11:41 pm: Edit \n\nMy daughter has to audition for her college theatre program for fall plays on the first day of classes in late August. She is a sophomore. She just got the letter about auditions and one of her monologues is supposed to be a one-minute \"serio-comic\" monologue. Does anyone have any suggestions for possible monologues that fit this? From what we can tell, this is a comedic monologue with serious overtones or theme, or the other way around. She wants to do something from a modern play. (I suggested Shakespeare but she said no.)\n\nBy Mtmommy (Mtmommy) on Monday, August 02, 2004 - 10:33 pm: Edit \n\nBookiemom--There has been lots of discussion on the musical theatre threads (there are 22) about choosing monologues. You can do a message search to find them. The overall opinion is reading lots of plays and finding monologues that work for the individual; it's impossible to tell someone else (esp. someone one doesn't know) what would make a good monologue for that person. It is impossible to read dozens and dozens of plays, though, without any direction at all. Hopefully, your daughter has enough guidance from her freshman year to know how to find the right type of plays to read. What my d found useful last year (freshman high school) when she had to have two \"perfect\" monologues, one comic and one serious, for the contemporary one was to search books of monologues FROM VERY RECENT PLAYS. When she found an exciting monologue, she then read the play to see if the character was a fit and because a knowledge of the play is mandatory. This is a backward approach, but it worked well for her because it allowed her to find a delicious monologue that captivated her right off and it allowed her to not have to read too many plays that were totally wrong for her (she did do some of that until she found a better approach). Just so nobody gets excited, I'm not talking about monologue books of monologues written just for auditions, but monologues from genuine plays.\n\nBy Bookiemom (Bookiemom) on Tuesday, August 03, 2004 - 12:44 pm: Edit \n\nThanks, MT Mommy. I also follow the MT thread, so I have already read all that info about choosing monologues. My D doesn't have any difficulty with that in general, it was specifically the serio-comic angle that was a little difficult to grasp. Your idea is a good one--thanks.\n\nBy Thesbohemian (Thesbohemian) on Wednesday, August 04, 2004 - 09:41 am: Edit \n\nYay! In the war with the stupid people, the smart people finally won a battle. Power to the people! Power to the oppressed! Power to the rational! URRAH!!! So, I\u0092m going back to pris ... school in a few days. I\u0092ll be descending into total AP Hell this fall, so I doubt I\u0092ll have much time for internet musings. I just wanted to thank everybody on this list for being SO much help in getting my college choices expanded. This time last year, I\u0092d never even heard of half the schools on my list! Anyway, here\u0092s my list as it stands right now:\n\nReaches (Unified auditions)\nThe Juilliard School\nNorth Carolina School of the Arts\n\nSupposed Matches (On-campus auditions)\nSouthern Methodist University\nFlorida State University\n\nSupposed Matches (Unified auditions)\nUniversity of Evansville\nUniversity of Miami\n\nSafeties (On-campus auditions for small theatre scholarships with big bucks for academics)\nCatawba College\nCollege of Charleston\n\nThis summer, various people have convinced me that if I get accepted at either of my reaches, I\u0092d be crazy not to go and my grandparents have said they\u0092ll pay for Juilliard if lightning so strikes. They\u0092re also working on getting my mom to open up my college trust for out-of-state schools if I fall in love with a place on a visit and only get a partial scholarship. We\u0092ll see how THAT goes ...\n\nInterestingly, I\u0092ve found this summer that I changed at school a lot more than I thought and I\u0092ve become more comfortable around semi-sane artsy people than my old \u0093normal\u0094 friends. I\u0092ve actually come to miss the madness. Maybe I'd like a pure conservatory. Ack! I\u0092m a cheerleader gone drama geek! Cap me, PLEASE!!!\n\nThanks again to everyone for all the help! There\u0092s a lot of good information on this thread and it should be kept going. Let me know if you want me to do links to new chapters. I'm no HTML guru like Shauna, but I can make 'em work. The next eight months are gonna be ... ummm ... interesting.\n\nBy Mtmommy (Mtmommy) on Wednesday, August 04, 2004 - 12:48 pm: Edit \n\nThesbohemian--Not to be a pain here, but my daughter and I are trying to figure out this issue for herself (she's a junior): how did you go about figuring out which schools were matches for you? It seems to me like it's so impossible to tell with an audition whether a school is a match or not. Thanks for any insight into this dilemma. . . .\n\nBy Catherdingmom (Catherdingmom) on Wednesday, August 04, 2004 - 02:39 pm: Edit \n\nThesbohemian, such good news! So glad that things worked out at your school AND that you have your list completed. That's a huge step--I'll be relieved when my son has his list finalized. You have at least two schools on your list that he will include on his. You're right--the next eight months will be \"interesting\". I'm hoping that they will be also be fun, exciting, and ... kind!\n\nBy Thesbohemian (Thesbohemian) on Wednesday, August 04, 2004 - 03:53 pm: Edit \n\nMtmommy,\nNo pain at all! I'm through with work and just hanging out this week doing as much of nothing as possible.\n\nIt really is kind of hard to tell about any of this for sure because it really depends on who else is out there auditioning for which schools on a given year. There's always the \"karma in the stars\" factor during auditions, too. I went about ranking them and my chances for admission based on where previous graduates of my school have been accepted along with what I've been told by my teachers and some other theatre professionals.\n\nMost years, the best two or three senior actors from my school have ended up going to places like Juilliard, CMU, NCSA, or SUNY Purchase. The next \"tier\" of between three and five have gone to places like SMU, FSU, Otterbein, DePaul, Rutgers, Boston University, Emerson, and Hart. We don't actually have anybody that I know of at Miami or Evansville but, from what I've been able to gather, they're roughly in the same \"league\" as the others admissions-wise. Then, there are always a couple of people who resort to \"safeties\" like CoC, Shorter or various BA programs along with some who decide to not major in theatre at all. We don't actually have anybody at Catawba, but it's on my list by recommendation of an alum who was the person who first dragged me by the hair to acting classes after seeing me portray Mary Magdalene in a church youth group skit. She's an MT grad who now has kids and teaches dance part-time, but some of her friends from college are regularly working actors in NY and LA.\n\nOf course this is all for straight theatre and I'm not sure how they stack up for MT. It's probably fairly similar, though. Hope this helps!\n\nBy Thesbohemian (Thesbohemian) on Wednesday, August 04, 2004 - 03:53 pm: Edit \n\nCatherdingmom,\nThanks! Which two? Let me know if I can be any help. BTW, I'm thinking about investing in an inflatable punching clown, myself ... There'll be no kindness in his world!\n\nBy Mtmommy (Mtmommy) on Wednesday, August 04, 2004 - 04:10 pm: Edit \n\nThesbohemian--Thanks for the info on your process. This is very helpful. My daughter is working on a list of schools and expects to have a couple of straight theatre schools in there, as well, but ones where she can also study voice and dance as well. I wish I could see a list somewhere of rankings of theatre departments because I really don't have too much of a clue. For example, I never would have guessed that SUNY Purchase would be considered more of a reach than Boston U. My daughter can't use your exact process, though, because we're in California--and California people think so differently about college than the rest of the country. Most people don't really notice there are schools outside of CA LOL. I think it's because our public universities are such a bargain. Most of the drama/MT kids ahead of her have gone to UCLA, USC (not that SC is a bargain!), Fullerton, and San Francisco.\n\nI hope things work out great for you this year. You sound like you really know where you're going (metaphorically speaking), and I believe that's a lot more than 50% of the getting there.\n\nBy Catherdingmom (Catherdingmom) on Thursday, August 05, 2004 - 12:38 pm: Edit \n\nThesbohemian, my son also is thinking about Catawba. We have not visited there yet but plan to visit in the fall. Like you, we don't really know a lot about it, but I spoke with someone in the theatre department who was very friendly and helpful. The location is also good for us.\n\nHe also plans to audition for NCSA. Of course, he realizes that the odds of getting in are slim, but if he doesn't apply, he has absolutely no chance of getting in.\n\nAs far as the rest of the schools he'll apply to, we'll just have to see what he comes up with!\n\nBy Thesbohemian (Thesbohemian) on Friday, August 06, 2004 - 11:01 am: Edit \n\nMtmommy,\nThanks! Yeah. If I were in CA, I\u0092d be looking there, too. As good a bargain as some of those schools are in-state, they\u0092re WAY expensive for those of us from the outside and I read Herr Terminator wants to raise them up even more. Also, Purchase is \u0093da shizzle\u0094 as far as their acting program goes. Fairly inexpensive, too. I scratched them off my reach list mainly because they\u0092re reputed for having an ugly, depressing-looking campus (pics seem to confirm this) where they often triple freshmen in dorms. The student body has a rep for being very politically active in a way, way, WAY left-of-center kind of way, too. Doesn\u0092t seem like a good fit for a semi-conservative redneck chick like me. No full rides, either. It\u0092ll probably be a great fit for the guy we have going this year, though. I love him, but he\u0092s a total freak of nature ... not that there\u0092s anything WRONG with that ...\n\nAs far as rankings go, the only book I\u0092ve seen is _The Performing Arts Major\u0092s College Guide, 3rd ed._ which is six years old and very suspect, IMHO. For instance, NCSA and CMU are listed as \u0093Other Noteworthy Undergraduate Programs\u0094 while Indiana University, Evansville, and Utah are on the \u0093Most Highly Recommended\u0094 list. They don\u0092t even have Otterbein or Hart on their radar. Go figure ... The only other rankings I\u0092ve seen are on The Princeton Review and those seem to be based on some kind of questionnaire as to how popular theatre groups are on campus.\n\nCatherdingmom,\nGood luck with the search! I found the people at Catawba very nice when I talked to them, too. I initially called the financial aid people to ask some specific questions about scholarship opportunities. They talked to me for a long time and insisted on transferring me to somebody in the theatre department. I ended up being on the phone for like an hour and really enjoyed it. Very warm and hospitable. Almost makes me feel guilty that they\u0092re on my safety list. The woman who turned me on to them says she turned down a couple of more \u0093prestigious\u0094 schools after her campus visit when she totally fell in love with the place. She says the faculty has mostly changed over since she was there, but the head of the BFA Performance track is the same and she\u0092s awesome.\n\nSheesh. I really oughtta be packing. Where to start ... LOL\n\nBy Alwaysamom (Alwaysamom) on Friday, August 06, 2004 - 11:50 am: Edit \n\nMtmommy, there are many unofficial ranked lists of drama schools but no official one that I'm aware of. The arts h/s that two of my daughters attended has compiled their own over the years, out of necessity and experience. We looked at it when my D knew that's what she wanted to continue in college, and then expanded it a bit and looked at several different programs. Here's the list they start with, for what it's worth. The top group are deemed the best for what most students at this particular school are looking for; the second group are also excellent.\n\nNYU\nUMichigan\nJuilliard\nCarnegie Mellon\nNorthwestern\nTufts\nBrandeis\nBoston U\nColumbia\n\n\nUCLA\nUSC\nFlorida State\nEmerson\nIthaca\nSyracuse\nPenn State\nUniversity of the Arts\nAdelphi\nBucknell\n\nBy Mtmommy (Mtmommy) on Friday, August 06, 2004 - 12:57 pm: Edit \n\nThanks, Thesbohemian and Alwaysamom! Alwaysamom, most of those schools my D has either put on her list or decided against (needs voice and dance opportunities, as well as available musicals either on or off campus), but there are a few I don't think she's researched, although Penn is on her list to investigate. Southern Methodist University's theatre looks good to her. It's not on any of the lists at your D's school?\n\nDoes anyone know anything abouat the theatre department (non-audition) at Arizona State University?\n\nBy Catherdingmom (Catherdingmom) on Friday, August 06, 2004 - 02:56 pm: Edit \n\nI notice that some colleges request headshots for prospective theatre students, and some just ask for a 2x2 photo. My son does not have a headshot, and no photographer in our area specializes in that kind of photography. Also since this would just be for use for college auditions, I don't want to spend big bucks for something that will be outdated by the time he graduates. He will have his senior photos made in a few weeks, and he will have options on how they are made. I've come across conflicting advice on headshots--black and white vs. color, close-up on just the head vs. more upper body. This is probably just a small detail that doesn't matter very much, but with the idea that a lot of small details can add up to impact favorably or negatively, I'd like it to be close to what is expected. Any suggestions?\n\nBy Alwaysamom (Alwaysamom) on Friday, August 06, 2004 - 03:59 pm: Edit \n\nCatherdingmom, the first thing I'd do is check with the specific colleges and confirm that they want an actual headshot. Many who say headshot are happy to just receive a photograph. If they confirm that it's a professional type headshot they want, I'm sure you could find a photographer to take them for you. Any photographer should be able to do that. Just explain what it is you need it for, sometimes they call them modelling shots. Most headshots I've seen are upper body and head shots. These seem to be the most common these days. Getting 'real' headshots done by a photographer who specializes in them can cost hundreds of dollars. When one of my daughters needed some done for auditions and for colleges, I chose a regular old photographer who had come recommended for something other than headshots. I explained what I wanted and he said he could do it with no problem. He took about 20 shots and we chose from the proofs which we wanted. They were black and white, which I believe is what is most common. Make sure you son is relaxed, dressed in something simple, and solid colors, usually black or white. Have a variety of poses done, open mouth smile, closed mouth smile, no smile, etc. Some with glasses if he wears them. Good luck!

I am not looking for a magical \"surge of energy\", just something that will keep my brain active as if I slept 7+ hours if I got <4.\n- Short-term use (for the days I get 2 hours of sleep), and not use it for the days I get 6+ hours of sleep.  I'll probably end up using these in cycles.  I.e. 10 days off, 4 days on.\n- Fast-acting.  Unlike antidepressants, you need to wait like 3 weeks for them to take effect.  I need a nootropic that works instantly, like coffee.\n- One that is not addicting.\n- Safe for long term use (4 years)... well actually, maybe a lifetime since working a 9-5 job requires a steady sleep schedule.\n\nWhy?\n\nI believe I may have DSPS (delayed sleep phase syndrome).  I've had it since high school.  Must have been due to the video game addiction from staring at a bright monitor during later hours coupled with my windows blocked out because I like sleeping in a dark room.  Furthermore I rarely had the will power to stay up until normal bed time after arriving home from school (since I slept <4 hours the night before).  And if I did manage to stay up until 11 p.m., for some odd reason I would only sleep for 2-3 hours and I would not be able to sleep until early morning, and I would feel tired all throughout the school day; I assume my brain's sleep signal is being released at the time of my first period class.  Because of this, I always took a 3-4 hour \"nap\" when I get home.  I eventually dropped out.  Terrible.\n\nSo for 2 years I did not do anything, not even a job (I hated mundane jobs), now couple that mindless sack of a **** lifestyle with my DSPS... you're gonna go insane.  I noticed my days were longer than 24 hours.  Awake for about 14-16 hours, and sleeping for up to 12-14 hours per day.  The cycle is pretty linear, in which I would actually have a normal sleep cycle within the range of \"normal\" for several days, until I slowly creep back up to being nocturnal again.  If I force myself to wake up at the same time every morning, I would eventually go through that time where I just would not be able to fall asleep at the right time, resulting in <4 hours of sleep again.  Usually, the first day this occurs I can stay up for another 15+ or so hours until it's normal bed time again.  However, in this case I would sleep at an even later time, resulting <3.9 hours of sleep.\n\n\nJust 4 months ago, I've fixed myself up now.  I've completed an academic upgrading program for gaining entrance for my community college.  However, the only reason why I think I've completed it was because it was an independent learning course.  You never really had to show up for \"class\" because there were no teachers teaching a lesson.  I had the luxury to sleep in for the days I had to.\n\nWhile I am already able to enter Fall terms, I've decided to detour and go back to a different agency to obtain pre-university courses.  The problem here is that the classes are traditionally taught (teacher + black board).  The reason why I'm detouring is because I want to see how I'd fair if I had to show up for class every day in a traditional classroom setting.  I would hate to drop out in college after paying $4000.

I am an immigrant from Russia and I was stuck in Mexico for half of my Freshman year, thus receiving a B in Spanish and a C in Algebra 2 while getting no marks for the rest of my classes that year. After I came back, my father was still stuck in Mexico so that put a major strain on my family and after he came back, the separation of my parents created an even bigger strain. I got a concussion at the end of freshman year so that caused me to get another C and all this family stuff cleared up only by the beginning of junior year. My sophomore year was littered with Bs as I had to struggle with a broken up family life. Junior year, after it had settled down a little bit, I received 4 As and a B in first semester (3 AP classes, Spanish 4th year, and Virtual Business) but slipped second semester and got 2 As, 3 Bs.\n\nThis Junior year me and a friend won first place at the New York International Trade Fair for our website (hundreds of schools from dozens of states and countries competed) and I now do freelance programming for small companies and organizations around the world.\n\nMost important however, is the stuff that I do off screen. I don't participate in many, if any, extra curricular activities and instead spend that time actually learning. I have so far taught myself calculus II and III, linear algebra, differential equations and the university level physics leading up to quantum mechanics, which I am currently learning along with partial differential equations. I am also currently learning electrical engineering and aerodynamics for the Team America Rocket Challenge and my computer science, both theoretical and practical, is well beyond the levels of most (equivalent to most Techers since I've done nothing but computers in the last 10 years including programming, security, graphics, etc.)\n\nEven with all the learning I had nothing to show for it so I am taking Ph135abc and Ae160ab at Caltech my senior year. It's not for credit or even auditing (Caltech is a closed campus) but I'll be taking all the homework and tests regular students will as well as sitting in/doing all of the projects (if any) and lectures. I have received permission from the professors to do so and at least one of them has promised me a letter of recommendation before college applications start going out. I am also looking at taking Cs156 and Ee051 which is computer science, which I have a lot more experience with then the Ae/Ph class.\n\nObviously I will go through at most half the second term in the classes but will that help? The two classes I'm taking for sure are graduate level courses, well beyond what my high school or the local community college has to offer. With the time I have available my senior year (even with multiple APs) I believe that I will pass the initial two classes since I'll be in a position to collaborate with the other students in the class.\n\nI am also entering TARC and ISEF this year but results won't be in until way after applications are due and I was thinking if it was worth waiting a year after high school before going anywhere and instead apply to Caltech/Stanford/etc. a second time? It would allow me to get an internship and take more Caltech classes which interest me more then anything I have ever had in high school.\n\nLast question would be, how would my relationship to Caltech in general help while writing the essay? My mother worked at Caltech as a post doc and I spent countless hours walking around Caltech and talking to people there. Even now I go there quite often to visit people who I've known, including a tech administrator who got me started with my first computer and science in general. Should I play up on that when I write the essay? I have been interested in the sciences and Caltech for a long time, I just need something to somehow overcome the uninspiring grades.\n\nEdit: sorry for the really really long post.

The author, Seth Godin, is an author of business marketing books:\n\nThe coming melt-down in higher education (as seen by a marketer)\nFor 400 years, higher education in the US has been on a roll. From Harvard asking Galileo to be a guest professor in the 1600s to millions tuning in to watch a team of unpaid athletes play another team of unpaid athletes in some college sporting event, the amount of time and money and prestige in the college world has been climbing.\n\nI'm afraid that's about to crash and burn. Here's how I'm looking at it.\n\n1. Most colleges are organized to give an average education to average students.\n\nPick up any college brochure or catalog. Delete the brand names and the map. Can you tell which school it is? While there are outliers (like St. Johns, Deep Springs or Full Sail) most schools aren't really outliers. They are mass marketers.\n\nStop for a second and consider the impact of that choice. By emphasizing mass and sameness and rankings, colleges have changed their mission.\n\nThis works great in an industrial economy where we can't churn out standardized students fast enough and where the demand is huge because the premium earned by a college grad dwarfs the cost. But...\n\n2. College has gotten expensive far faster than wages have gone up.\n\nAs a result, there are millions of people in very serious debt, debt so big it might take decades to repay. Word gets around. Won't get fooled again...\n\nThis leads to a crop of potential college students that can (and will) no longer just blindly go to the 'best' school they get in to.\n\n3. The definition of 'best' is under siege.\n\nWhy do colleges send millions (!) of undifferentiated pieces of junk mail to high school students now? We will waive the admission fee! We have a one page application! Apply! This is some of the most amateur and bland direct mail I've ever seen. Why do it?\n\nBiggest reason: So the schools can reject more applicants. The more applicants they reject, the higher they rank in US News and other rankings. And thus the rush to game the rankings continues, which is a sign that the marketers in question (the colleges) are getting desperate for more than their fair share. Why bother making your education more useful if you can more easily make it appear to be more useful?\n\n4. The correlation between a typical college degree and success is suspect.\n\nCollege wasn't originally designed to merely be a continuation of high school (but with more binge drinking). In many places, though, that's what it has become. The data I'm seeing shows that a degree (from one of those famous schools, with or without a football team) doesn't translate into better career opportunities, a better job or more happiness.\n\n5. Accreditation isn't the solution, it's the problem.\n\nA lot of these ills are the result of uniform accreditation programs that have pushed high-cost, low-reward policies on institutions and rewarded schools that churn out young wanna-be professors instead of experiences that turn out leaders and problem-solvers.\n\nJust as we're watching the disintegration of old-school marketers with mass market products, I think we're about to see significant cracks in old-school schools with mass market degrees.\n\nBack before the digital revolution, access to information was an issue. The size of the library mattered. One reason to go to college was to get access. Today, that access is worth a lot less. The valuable things people take away from college are interactions with great minds (usually professors who actually teach and actually care) and non-class activities that shape them as people. The question I'd ask: is the money that mass-marketing colleges are spending on marketing themselves and scaling themselves well spent? Are they organizing for changing lives or for ranking high? Does NYU have to get so much bigger? Why?\n\nThe solutions are obvious... there are tons of ways to get a cheap, liberal education, one that exposes you to the world, permits you to have significant interactions with people who matter and to learn to make a difference. Most of these ways, though, aren't heavily marketed nor do they involve going to a tradition-steeped two-hundred-year old institution with a wrestling team. Things like gap years, research internships and entrepreneurial or social ventures after high school are opening doors for students who are eager to discover the new.\n\nThe only people who haven't gotten the memo are anxious helicopter parents, mass marketing colleges and traditional employers. And all three are waking up and facing new circumstances.

Basically: think long and hard about attending Chicago.\n\nThis year's LS admissions cycle is just about over and I must say, I'm very disappointed with the results. In high school, I was one of those who valued learning above everything else and thus believed U of C was the perfect environment for me. I applied to Ivies, got into Brown and Cornell (+Duke) but chose Chicago over all of them for the intellectual environment. I loved my time here. I spent my years working really hard and not really caring about grades all that much as long as I gave my best in everything (I had top stats coming out of high school so I thought I would naturally do well). I spent a lot of time debating with friends and professors. I turned down invitations to social gatherings, thinking all the hard work would pay off someday and that those other people who went out so often would someday wish they'd studied as hard as I did.\n\nWell, I ended up with a ~3.3 cumulative (in classics) at the time of application (which is respectable, but not great) and a 174 LSAT (99th percentile, for those of you who don't know). I got rejected by HYS+Columbia+Chicago(that REALLY hurt, I have to say)+NYU. Also denied by Berkeley, Virginia (YP?), Northwestern (work experience requirement). Waitlisted at Penn, Duke, Georgetown. In the end, I had only two T14 acceptances: Michigan and Cornell. Don't get me wrong, I'm glad I got into Michigan and Cornell. However, it hurts to know that on the 2nd try, I wasn't able to achieve my lifelong ambition to attend a tippy top school like Harvard. Yeah, I genuinely love learning, but I thought my love for it would be so strong that it would naturally help me acquire the prerequisites for admission to super-elite schools at the same time.\n\nMy point is: I loved the education I got here. It really was wonderful, but I can't help feeling it also limited my law options for the rest of my life. I could have gotten a higher GPA elsewhere, gotten the same LSAT and gotten into not only Columbia but possibly the big H as well. I actually have a friend who applied with a 3.9 from Brown and a 173 LSAT who got into H + Columbia + Chicago+ most other elites. Seeing my and my friends' results, I'm also not so sure U of C actually gets the boost in LS admissions people claim it does. I've grown cynical about the process and really do believe deans just care about the numbers they report to USNWR. I think it's because they see LSAT as a leveler for those with varying GPAs, so a 3.9 at Brown isn't necessarily inflated their eyes when coupled with a top score.\n\nSo yeah, pursue a Chicago education at your own risk. I've committed to one of the schools that took me but will pursue my wait lists vigorously.\n\nA caveat that could've made a difference: I was involved in a decent number of clubs (3) but had no official leadership positions (though I highlighted my leadership-type work). I did develop good relations with 2 professors, each of whom wrote me a strong letter of recommendation.

Perhaps I'm on the wrong forum as everyone else considers bad having 9A's or Missing an A* but as I said I had a lot of personal issues in my final year which ultimately led to my downfall I didn't look for any excuses then and I'm not now. I'm just looking at possible ways to fix the situation I'm currently restricted to.\n\nI had a look at collegeboard and saw that most/all colleges want the following : Rigor of secondary school record from what year would this start as my average GPA for high school would have been much better  (except my final year which involved my GCSE exams) I'd be guessing a 2.4-2.6 on average obviously converted I know that isn't great yet again compared to the normal standards here but I was happy with it (was at Private school) and was middle of my class. Would this alleviate the necessity for my GCSE (GPA) or not ?\n\nI have a couple of other plans if this isn't the case I don't know if they'd be acceptable or not but I'll run them over with you. Would taking the GED exam allow me to use my High School GPA rather than my GCSE's for GPA or not ?\n\n\nMoving on to where I am now I took the SAT and ACT tests and got the following results\n\nSAT\n\nReading : 640\nMath : 590\nWriting : 610\n\nACT : 30\n\nwell if you can help me out with a personal dilemma I'd be grateful If I can't get into a 4 year University in the USA I'll be looking Internationally! I also know there's some poor grammar but I've done this all from a phone so please don't be too harsh on that aspect of my post thanks!

Several examples from history and literature clearly exemplify how first impressions are seldom correct or of any value.\n\nIn Huckleberry Finn by Mark Twain, the reader is presented with a boy, Huck, that seems to be a failure. Huck is infamous for skipping school and deviating from the morals of his southern society; as a result, he is an outcast in his society. But, as the novel progresses Huck meets an escaped slave named Jim, and as his relationship with Jim grows stronger so does his apprehension about his society. Eventually he is seen several times saying he would rather go to hell than follow the racist teachings of his society. As a result, through deep introspection Huck is unaffected by his society and is able to make his own decisions and form his own moral conscience. Toward the end of the novel, Twain places a strong contrast between Huck and Tom Sawyer, a boy that is largely a product of southern society. The reader goes on to find out that Sawyer is a lot more immature than Huck; this is because Tom Sawyer had subscribed to the teachings of his southern society. His immaturity is greatly exemplified in his dangerous escapades where he eventually gets shot. The story of Huck greatly shows that what some people might consider a failure at first glance may actually be more of a success than they had first expected.\n\nThe Cold War also clearly shows that first impressions are not only useless in fiction but also in real life political conflicts. The two main opponents of the Cold War, The U.S. and the USSR, competed to see who had better Inter Continental Ballistic Missiles (ICBM). By August 1957 the USSR had launched its first ICBM, and by July of the following year its first earth satellite, sputnik. The launch of sputnik inaugrated the space race, which astronaut Frank Boreman described as \"just a battle in the Cold War to see who has superior ICBM's.\" And although most people consider the Cold War as a major modern crisis that cost the U.S. over 8 trillion dollars and the lives of more than 100,000 americans, it sparked unprecedented increases in spending on education and research. To this day more than 1200 american schools retain their very own planeterium.\n\nAfter closely examining the Cold War and The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn one can safely conclude that, indeed, first impressions should not be taken at more than face value.

My son insisted he could handle being rejected at all of them and I said as long as he applied to schools that either met full need (preferably w/no loans or very low) or over 95% as I did not want to face the situation of him getting into a reach school that we had no way of paying for. Son applied to 7 reach schools, roughly 3 low, 2 middle and 2 high, non for EA or ED (this may have been a mistake but too late now) so these results are starting to trickle in. Son was accepted to all his safety and match schools, aid packages are trickling in, with some doable packages so son will be going somewhere next fall.\n\nWhether it\u0092s because he was accepted to all match and safety schools, so he began to think he wouldn\u0092t be rejected or because it\u0092s easy to say it won\u0092t bother you to be rejected, but harder to actually feel that way, I don\u0092t know but we have received the results so far from three of the reach schools, 2 at the low end and 1 in the middle. (I swore to son that I was not putting so much information in these posts that he could be identified, {although I would bet I\u0092m the only parent at his school who posts on CC},  son can\u0092t believe a site like CC draws so many parents, he finds it odd we spend time reading and posting, but so be if). Of the three we have gotten so far, we have 1 rejection (the mid-range), 1 acceptance and 1 wait-list (oddly in my opinion the school that waitlisted him is not quite as selective as the school that admitted him, but I\u0092m coming to see that if you\u0092re in range, there really is no way to predict the odds).\n\nThe school that rejected him (I hate that word), is probably the one he was most emotionally invested in attending, he knows some students there, feels he\u0092s at their level or in one case considerably above. He is well aware it was probably his GPA (rough 9th grade, better 10th and excellent 11th & 12th) that was the first thing he asked. I told him yes, it was probably his GPA and the fact that he is a resident of the state and the school is making an effort to expand the geographical diversity. To make matters worse, (in his mind, I thought it might be a good sign) the letter stated that if his performance freshman year in college continued the same trend his last 2 HS years showed, they would be interested in seeing a transfer application, (son said, well maybe I\u0092m not interested in showing them a transfer application).\n\nThe school that waitlisted him spoke highly of the strength of his application and said to be sure to watch the mail for details about wait-listing and mentioned that  the list was not ranked in order of preference on their part (exactly what this means I do not understand). Son asked, why if his application was so strong they didn\u0092t admit him. I see two possibilities; one which we may be able to improve on and one which will not change.\n\nThe first is demonstrated interest; the school posted that at the end, they had more candidates that admission staff wanted to admit than they could admit and now the hard-part was weeding though those and one of the things they looked for was demonstrated interest, they didn\u0092t want to offer a place to a student who would be unlikely to attend. Well we didn\u0092t visit, the school is quite far away, though we would plan a visit if admitted, there were no admission events that we knew about within 100 miles and he never actually spoke to anyone from the school. He did email, request information and do a considerable amount of research on the school so had a decent why this school essay, so he knows he is interested and it\u0092s very possible he would attend it admitted. This we might can fix, letter, phone call etc\u0085\n\nThe second possibility is that while the school meets 100% of need, I was unable to find out if they were need-blind for admissions. If they wait-listed him because of the amount of FA we will need, then that takes the school out of consideration, because that won\u0092t change and the only way he could attend if taken off the wait-list is if he is still given FA. I know schools vary on whether there is aid for wait-listed students or not, I\u0092m hoping the letter might have more information on that.\n\nI\u0092m pretty sure we can\u0092t find out why he was wait-listed, but I was wondering could son\u0092s GC possibly be able to find out? Son is private-schooled so GC is available. I have emailed GC but thought I\u0092d see if anyone had any thoughts on this. Interestingly son is forgetting about the reach that did admit him that we\u0092re waiting on a FA package from. I am not looking forward to this next week. And I\u0092ll be watching, the other lower reach, is also in the same state, we did not visit it either, however both he and I had personally spoken to his admissions counselor and communicated the fact that this is the type of school son wants to attend and the dean of admissions emailed him and said they wanted to increase the number of students from out state, so maybe that will help. Guess we should have done the same with the other school. The one reach that he was rejected from he had visited a couple of times, the other three he\u0092s not visited. He\u0092s been on campus a few summers ago at one for a Boy Scout event, been in the state several times, he had an alumni interview with one and the other, well he had reasons for applying, it wasn\u0092t just on a whim, but I don\u0092t know what the school will think. The top 2 are such high reaches, I would probably faint if he got in, but heck at this point, who knows.

Yale has been a dream school for me, and I can hardly believe this is true.\n\nHowever, now that it is coming true, I've realized that I have some reservations about actually attending. My main fears are about academic competition and keeping my GPA up.\n\nYou see, I'm a Chinese American at a large public school in Arkansas, and even though I'm an IB student, the rigor of my coursework probably can't compare with, say, that of a typical Harvard-Westlake, Deerfield, Andover, Lawrenceville, etc. student. I have decent standardized test scores (see results thread post: http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/yale-university/1114274-official-yale-class-2015-rd-results-thread-4.html#post12307867) which I think academically qualify me for Yale....but does \"academically qualified\" mean I could actually do well? Despite my small-town background, how possible would it be for me to compete well against people from elite prep schools around the world, magnet programs in NYC, etc.?\n\nDon't get me wrong--I really, really, really want to attend, and I'm more than willing to work hard. I just don't want to spend my next 4 years constantly scrambling to scrape a 3.0 together or something like that.\n\nHas anyone been in a similar situation?

I'm writing to ask something about studying in England next year, which I've got no idea actually. I hope someone can answer my questions. Thanks in advance.\n\nFirst of all, I should tell you that I'd like to study Law, English or History (sorted according to my preference) in university. Geography is also on my list.\n\nSecondly, I got 23 marks (out of 30) in the HKCEE. To be specific there's a 5* (grade5) in Chinese, 5 (grade 4) in English, two Bs for Chinese Literature and History and the rest are Cs, including Geography and Economics. (my Computer Literacy and Maths are also C, but they are extra)\n\nHonestly speaking this is not a decent result. Anyway I'm now preparing for the coming HK A-Level Exam (HKALE) next year, that's all my background and here comes my questions.\n\nQ1.

But someone told me that they would rather focus on the HKALE and just ignore the HKCEE)\n\nQ2. Again it's about the HKCEE. If it counts, does my result make me less competitive as the only 5* comes from Chinese and, furthermore, a B is from Chinese Literature?\n\nQ3. Then it's about the HKALE. In order to send myself to England, how many marks should I get at least in the coming exam?\n\nQ4. IELTS is the clearest target that I've got at this stage, as I know it's a key to open the door to England. Could you tell me, again, a preferred mark that I should get?\n\nQ5. Should I attend other exams or courses, apart from ILETS, such as GCE-A Level?\n\nQ6. Lastly, should I join any organisations, such as agent organisation?\n\nFinally, thank you very much for reading even till here.

I ran my own local IT company for two years (and a amassed a rather significant sum of wealth as a result of this), have a couple of patents in my name, and acquired several levels of Microsoft and Sun certification before I turned 16.  I'm currently a junior and I'm looking to double major in composition (which has sucked up much of my time, love it as I may) and Economics.  I received a 2390 on the SAT, and I have self studied for and then taken 10 AP exams thus far, after this year that number will be 23 (I received scores of '5' on all but two of the exams, both of which I received a '4' on).\n\nSo I'm in decent standing as far as all of that goes, but the issue is that my GPA is absolutely horrible. Unfortunately I go to a school where actual learning and intellectualism is far removed from actual coursework, and along with a number of repugnant aspectsof the socio-cultural environment, I had been rendered in a state of what Durkheim might call anomie. As such, I didn't attend school much and ended up being stuck in situations where I'd walk into tests and get A's and B's, but fail classwork/homework due to having unexcused absences.  I have realized that being angsty about such things simply doesn't cut it, so I have buckled down as of late and received my two quarterly 4.0s, but this has only pulled me from a 2.0 to around a  2.87 cumulatively.  Clearly that's not nearly good enough for a school like Wesleyan, Amherst, or Swarthmore, but my hope is that being smaller schools, this could be overlooked given my extra-curricular achievement, SAT score, and independent study for APs.\n\nSo with a ~2.9 GPA,  2390 on the SAT, 23 + AP exams with 5s, and more high-level/adult work experience than 99.9% of applicants, will the admissions offices of any of the aforementioned schools show any mercy (or perhaps even an iota of adherence to their doctrines of 'holistic evaluation..' )?\n\nI'm not sure what to think, especially since my situation runs counter to everything that the admissions process normally revolves around, despite the fact that I still - at least to some extent - necessarily meet the expressed criteria for most schools (the qualitative side of the criteria, anyway.)\n\nCertainly in respect to Wesleyan's criteria...\n\n\"Genuine intellectual curiosity. \"  I love nothing more than pure academia, and I've got national competition results in things like quizbowl and history bowl to show for it.\n\n\"Ability to succeed in a rigorous and broad-based academic program\"  APs are pretty rigorous and broad - and far, far harder than any normal high school course...\n\n\"Demonstrated social involvement and leadership qualities\"  I'm the leader of my school's FIRST Robotics team, a student officer for the Maryland state department of education, and had roughly 15 employees at a time, all at least 3 years older than me.\n\nBut I suppose it's common knowledge that the whole 'holistic evaluation' schpiel is mostly just not representative of how things work out.\n\nIn any case, I'm in desperate need of some input, so any perspective at all would be greatly appreciated.

So here goes:\n\nIn April, I took the ACT feeling extremely confident. I walked in confident, took the test confident, and left the test center feeling confident. I was expecting to get at least a 32, I got a 29 (31 English 29 Math 29 Reading 27 Science, 11 essay). I had taken a practice test from the official ACT prep guide but definitely had not studied intensively.\n\nIn May, I took the SAT. I had studied by practicing a fair amount of Math sections, and by learning all I could about Writing. I hadn't really worked on Critical Reading though. I felt like I bombed the test; I was distraught after finishing. I was also so mad that I recognized so many words from Direct Hits, but didn't remember the definitions. I merely recognized they were in Direct Hits. After the test, I was praying for just an 1800 so it wouldn't be a trainwreck if top school saw it. Result: 2010 (600 CR, 670 Math, 740 Writing, 10 essay)\n\nSo, with confidence, I studied for the June SAT. I memorized the words in both Direct Hits books cold, practiced reading passages, reviewing the answers with explanations from CB and by trying to figure them out myself. I reviewed Writing and practiced more math. I took the 3rd test in the Blue Book two days before my SAT in one sitting. 700 CR, 720 Math, 780 Writing, with 10 essay). I then felt great taking my SAT that Saturday, hoping I had broke 2200, but almost positive I had broke 2100, so I knew I would be satisfied. I could relax and know I had the summer to study for subject tests. Result: 2040 (620 CR, 710 Math, 710 Writing, 10 essay). I was so sure I was above 650 on CR and was actually expecting an 800 on Writing because I thought it was so easy. Ugh.\n\nIn June, I also retook the ACT without studying at all. Of course, this was after my SAT, which I had felt confident about, so I stupidly didn't care much for this test. It was in a run-down, hot, high school, and the proctors had no idea what they were doing. I had my eyes set on summer. Well, I at least tried, worked through English no problem. Math was easy like most said, but the problems took forever to solve, so I believe I guessed on at least 5. Then reading came. I felt like I had an extreme case of ADD, as I just couldn't focus at all and didn't care. Wasting so much time, I just skimmed the passages with remaining time and guessed on most questions. Science was worse, I was thinking, \"how is it even possible to do this in the allotted time? I don't care at all!\" I must've guessed, not educated guessed, just completely guessed on 15 questions. I was going to cancel my score because I was sure it would ruin my chances at top schools if they saw it. Result: 30, (34 English 34 Math 25 Reading 27 Science, 9 Essay). How i managed a 34 in math, and the same science score as last time, I have no idea. I would love to know how.\n\n\nTo sum this up, it appears that whenever I study, prepare myself, and feel confident about a test, I get a mediocre result. When I feel lost, and afraid that I'm failing, I surprise myself.\nGiven my less ACT prep time, do you believe I am more of an ACT taker? Btw, I only had a 163 on my PSAT, so I have vast improvement, but perhaps not much more on the SAT? I feel like my Math and Writing won't improve unless I get lucky, and that it'll require a lot of work to improve CR.\nWill it be possible to bring my 29 Reading and 27 Science up to get around a 33 composite? I like the idea of using the ACT in lieu of the SAT and subject tests, but do any of you think I'd be better off studying for the SAT more, or have I about reached my score limit?

This is one of those programs.  If you are thinking of studying music composition at BGSU, please, PLEASE do yourself a favor and read the entirety of my review!\n\nAvant-garde reigns supreme at BGSU.  Anything else is not only discouraged but DISCRIMINATED against.  If avant-garde is your aesthetic, then you just might love it here.  They have cultivated an atmosphere that is nurturing and beneficial SOLELY to students whose aesthetic fit the faculty's aesthetic and ideology; anyone and everyone with a mind of their own who would fall out of the lock-step will have an exceedingly difficult and aggravating experience here.  The narrow scope of the faculty's view of what New Music should be will become all too evident within a month of studying here.  God help you if you want to do something besides avant-garde/experimentalism.\n\nBGSU has a fantastic, top-of-the-line music technology lab... but even I was never allowed inside!  A grad student in composition, I wasn't allowed access to the more advanced tech studios because I wasn't committed to avant-garde electronic music.  Only the students who are devoted to using the high-end software for electronic avant-garde as preferred by the professors are given access.  Most of us weren't even allowed into the room!  Only a handful of the professors' chosen few could experience BGSU's music technology to its boasted potential.  That, to be plain, is FALSE ADVERTISING; the boasted caliber of BGSU's music technology is irrelevant to the vast majority of music students.\n\nBGSU is an extremely dogmatic environment.  Master classes focus ONLY on the avant-garde, to the point of redundancy.  Example: Twice in one semester, entire master classes were devoted to John Cage, attempting to drill the importance of his aesthetic into us.  That time could have been spent looking at a composer with a different aesthetic, thereby making the master class more well-rounded over the course of the semester, but because John Cage is a god to the faculty of BGSU, they wanted to double up on presenting on him.\n\nFrom the point of view of the faculty, their purpose and mission is to groom you for further \"success\" in academic music.  They strive to produce graduates who reflect well upon the music program at BGSU and the aesthetic ideology thereof.  From their point of view, either you are going to go on to pursue doctoral-level studies or you are going to be some sort of independent member of the New Music community at large, but they can't imagine allowing you through the program without making CERTAIN that you are committed to perpetuating their aesthetics with your future career.\n\nAnd so they must convert you.  If you have a different aesthetic, you are a dissenter and, as such, will be broken down until you see things their way.  You will be silenced, neglected, ignored, and even insulted... unless and until you adapt to avant-garde.\n\nSometimes the faculty are subtly insulting or condescending, sometimes passive-aggressive, and one particular professor has a way of silencing dissenting viewpoints by exasperatedly dismissing them outright.  Example: In one master class, everyone in the composition department gathered to spend an hour discussing a published essay in the vein of their exact brand of aesthetic.  About forty people were sitting in a large circle of chairs, supposedly expected to have an open and equal discussion on the topic.  A fellow grad student of mine brought up an interesting question about the latent hypocrisy in the essay, and this professor tersely retorted, \"Well then you need to read the essay again.\"  So much for an open discussion, huh?  He was a grad student who happened to compose music largely in the Baroque style, which is all but abhorred by the faculty, and because he had a logically sound argument against the writer's point, the professor verbally slapped him down with an irritated and dismissive, \"Well then you need to read the essay again.\"  (Although he had already read the essay more times than anyone in the room.)  Stunned, he said nothing for the rest of the \"discussion,\" and the only dialogue for the remainder of the meeting was from the more obsequious students, those who wouldn't employ critical thinking to dare oppose the accepted ideology.  You see, the composition department at BGSU is all about their-way-or-the-highway.  \u0093Silence all dissenters\u0094 seems to be their motto.\n\nI can think of countless instances in which I was treated like a second-class citizen because I didn't want to just be another avant-garde clone.  I wanted to GET something out of my two years as a grad student, but I was denied much of the equal treatment and attention many of the other students received.\n\nEven early on in my time there, October of my first semester, things were bad.  It was the annual New Music and Arts Festival, a days-long gala of numerous concerts, seminars, and events.  The composition majors were all conscripted to do various tasks to assist in getting the festival underway.  Every concert/recital was considered a big deal, and it was even mandatory for us to attend them all, yet my professors somehow scheduled me to miss one of them while I was assigned to wait at the loading dock for a truck, to unload amps and other equipment for an upcoming concert.  From what I'd heard, it was actually the most enjoyable and diverse (read: palatable) concert of the whole festival, but my professors forced me to miss it.  And I was barely even given access to conversations with the guest composers, other than the airport runs I was required to make.  When the composition students were treated to dinner at a Lebanese restaurant with the guest composers as a reward for our hard work during the festival, I didn't get to talk to any of them.  Overall, both annual New Music and Arts Festivals were just horrendous experiences for me.\n\nEven the student-run organization to promote New Music is mired in the dogmatic agenda of the faculty.  This organization is called Praecepta, which is a pretentious composite of two Latin words that no one in the organization could even remember what they meant.  So the pseudo-Latin \"Praecepta\" group was all about putting on concerts of students' compositions that would otherwise not be performed.  But they programmed experimentalism almost exclusively.  When I would try to program a piece, they always agreed that it was \"the wrong time,\" or it was \"not right for the theme of the concert,\" because it didn't fit with the homogeneous aesthetic agenda of the group.  Eventually, I just stopped going to the meetings, when it became obvious that I wasn't going to get anything out of it.\n\nAnother organization, the New Music Ensemble, is likewise seemingly devoted to the destruction of tonal music.  The professor in charge of the NME declared his intentions to punish the ears of the audience with one particular concert titled \"Rhythm and Death,\" his objective being to anger the audience by subjecting them to a straight hour of excessively abrasive \"music.\"  His goal was to deliver a concert so unpleasant to the ear as to actually make people angry.  (Incidentally, he succeeded.)\n\nImportant caveat to the would-be composition major: IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN LEARNING ORCHESTRATION, don't bother even applying to BGSU.  I was surprised to learn that it isn't taught there.  It isn't even addressed.  It is actually discouraged.  They assume that you have a passing familiarity with the composer Maurice Ravel, a master orchestrator, but they NEVER address any music like that during the master classes.  (Atonal composer Pierre Boulez, on the other hand, is considered a genius orchestrator worth studying.  Convenient.)  One of the composition professors would always say, about older composers' traditional styles, \"It's already been done,\" instead looking only for new ways of experimenting, caring more about helping you to find edgy new ways to NOTATE your music than to actually compose it.  But one of the professors (of the four available for composition lessons at the time) was known for her orchestration, and I naturally wanted to take lessons from her, but she flat-out refused to give me lessons.  She didn't think I was worth her time to teach one-on-one, so she didn't even give me a chance.  The main reason I was pursuing a Master's in the first place was so I could better learn to handle an orchestra, but orchestration is not taught at BGSU at all.\n\nFurthermore, the faculty at BGSU are abysmally bad at communication.  Consistently throughout my time there, my classmates would express the same frustration about the faculty's inability to give us any semblance of instructions or expectations.  For any project, paper, or presentation, the composition faculty would never really give us parameters on ANYTHING, proceed to assure us \"it will be fine,\" then fault us for not doing it right.  Not only would they not give us ENOUGH guidelines, they repeatedly MISinformed us about details regarding the thesis defense, then got angry at us when we didn't magically prepare every detail and jump through every hoop in the exact way THEY envisioned us to do it.  We would press for details, get not enough to go on, continue to press for information, and end up doing the best we could with what we knew they wanted, and, incredible as it may sound, the faculty ended up being irritated because we followed their poor instructions to the letter.  Every time.\n\nThe two biggest examples of this would be the thesis defense (your grand finale to the program) and the big analysis paper-and-presentation project that all second-year grad students are required to do.  I have much to say on the subject of the analysis project, but I will come back to that later.\n\nAs my time went on at BGSU, it got progressively worse for me.  At first, I thought I was just imagining things.  Eventually, however, it became more obvious to me, until finally one of the professors more or less admitted that the faculty were against me (I will come back to that later, as well).  My second year, I started working on my master's thesis early.  I started in the fall, months before some of my classmates, and I still ended up finishing AFTER them, because I was stymied at every turn.  My thesis adviser would tell me to do one thing one week, then at the next week's meeting tell me to do the opposite, which just wasted time.  Because I started my thesis composition so early, she seemed to think that that meant she could drag out the process until the very last second before the March deadline to apply for May graduation, but my intention was to have it DONE early so I wouldn't have to worry about it, so I could actually have breathing room and get something out of my last few months at BGSU.  But both she and the other professor on my thesis defense committee procrastinated and postponed, so I ended up working on my thesis tirelessly, week after week, for nearly my ENTIRE second year, because I was constantly being juggled by my professors.  Then, in March, when it was clear that my thesis defense schedule would push me back to an August graduation rather than May, I was immediately moved to the BOTTOM of their list of priorities so they could instead fast-track other grad students' theses in order to let THEM graduate on time, even though they didn't start theirs until after Christmas and I had been working on mine since early OCTOBER.  Unbelievable!  I should have been FINISHED, or at the very least, at the TOP of the pecking order, since I took the initiative MONTHS before anyone else and had been revising it nonstop!  But no, because THEY failed to hold up THEIR end of the bargain in a timely fashion, and because my adviser refused to let me be FINISHED with the piece until it was too late, I was bumped to an August graduation and FURTHER ignored in favor of every other student after me.  Outrageous.  (I ended up not even walking for graduation, because my lease expired in July, so I had to pick up and leave Ohio to go back home, so I didn't even know until two years later that my thesis adviser dropped the ball on following through with my application for graduation.  So I didn't even technically graduate until I applied retroactively, two years later.  Yet another way that professor failed me.)\n\nI have another example of how the professors treated me like a second-class citizen because I wasn't one of their pet avant-garde students.  When any comp student or professor has a premiere, it is expected (mandatory) that everyone be present.  I had a large choral work premiered at an off-campus venue, so it did not mandate everyone's attendance.  While several of my classmates attended, NOT ONE of the faculty was in attendance at my concert!  NOT ONE.  That was during my last semester at BGSU, and by that point the professors had become much more transparent in their antipathy of me.  This is yet another example of how some students are treated like second-class citizens: the faculty will break their own rules, just to snub or neglect you.  If you don\u0092t want to learn to compose music exactly like theirs, they will not help you.\n\nBut it gets worse than that.\n\nLet me tell you about the analysis presentations that all second-year grad students are required to perform.  Each student must choose a contemporary composition and focus on a fairly narrow aspect for their analysis paper and presentation to the entire master class.  The student must prove a graduate-level ability to analyze THOROUGHLY, demonstrating a complete theoretical understanding.  But I can't explain it any better than that, because this was yet another example of how poorly the faculty would instruct us to do anything.  Even they couldn't give us decent guidelines.  I was in the first wave of presenters, so I didn't even have anyone else's project to compare mine to.  Until that point, every year the project, while daunting, had been a mere formality, a mere hurdle to jump.  It wasn't even pass-fail; it was pass-PASS.  Everybody always passed, until the year of my class.  Then the faculty arbitrarily decided to suddenly make it pass-fail, and because I was the first, they failed ME.  But they didn't fail my presentation for lack of quality: they failed me because my analysis was \"too deep.\"  I ran it by my adviser beforehand, and she insisted that I was good to go, so I made SURE that I was doing EXACTLY what the faculty wanted me to do, and they still reneged and decided to fail me just to make an example of me so the other grad students wouldn't simply fudge their way through the project, as it had previously always been merely a rite of passage, not a potential graduation-blocker.\n\nIn fact, one of the professors even told me that when I spoke to him about writing an appeal letter.  He ACTUALLY told me, \"Your presentation was a lot better than those that shouldn't have passed but did. But you have to start cracking down somewhere, and where do you start?\"  Well, I would think you would start with one of the worse presentations!  He proceeded to condescend to me by telling me that I had a second chance and needed to be \"proactive about it,\" that they were doing me a FAVOR by \"letting\" me write an appeal letter to start the whole thing over from scratch, and that I shouldn't waste that opportunity.\n\nI met with one of the other composition faculty, my adviser for my thesis and for this project, and after pressing her for information, she revealed to me that the reason they failed me was because at least one of the other professors thought I plagiarized because my writing was too eloquent (much more eloquent than this review, I assure you).  I'll repeat that: they failed me because they had such a low opinion of me that they believed my writing was simply too GOOD to be my own.  What an insult!  My language in academic writing is much better than it is elsewhere, which I would think is a given with everyone, but in my case it caused them to disbelieve both my intelligence AND my integrity.  I was shocked.\n\nMy professor was unfortunately out of the state during my presentation, so she wasn't able to defend me when they decided to fail me, and she certainly made no effort to vouch for me AFTER the fact.  When I told her that I felt that the other professors had a very low opinion of my intelligence, INSTEAD of denying it, she looked me straight in the eye and conceded, \"Then you'll just have to prove them wrong.\"\n\nThis was late April, two months before I finished my entire degree, and I was actually seriously considering just dropping out of the graduate program, so close to the end, because I was convinced at this point that the faculty would just continue to find excuses to delay my degree completion until I finally conformed to what they wanted me to be as a composer.\n\nI wrote my appeal letter, and they scheduled my make-up presentation during finals week, also the same week as my thesis defense.  I think they were purposefully trying to overwhelm me by scheduling ALL of my tasks back-to-back (no one else had to do that).  But I did it.  I dumbed down my analysis project for them so they wouldn't think that I plagiarized.  I also dumbed it down because my adviser thought my original analysis \"had too much meat,\" though she once again neglected to help me meet her arcane expectations in the many meetings leading up to the presentation.  Everything she would tell me to do, she would contradict when she would later elaborate on it.  (Again, the terrible instruction and communication on behalf of the entire faculty at every turn.)\n\nWhat all of this means is that I did TOO good of a job and the faculty didn't expect it coming from me; because I didn\u0092t fall in line with the faculty\u0092s dogmatic view of what a proper academic composer should think, they looked down on my intelligence.  Fact.\n\nSeveral other students were outraged on my behalf, but nothing came of it.\n\nThe music faculty have proven time and again to be SELF-SERVING, NARROW-MINDED, DOGMATIC, CONCEITED, and DISCRIMINATING... but they are also CORRUPT.  Next, I will tell you about their bullying and corruption...\n\nPraecepta, the aforementioned student organization to promote \"New Music,\" had a few thousand dollars in funds by the time I arrived for my first semester at BGSU.  A couple of my predecessors had put together a competent budget proposal to the student organization board, procuring funds specifically for the purchase of sound equipment to support off-campus performances.  However, with those two grad students no longer around, one of the professors saw an opportunity to requisition those funds to promote his own work on a national tour.  This professor had plenty of his own money (or grant money) to use, but he decided he had a right to take all of our organization's funds.  The piece was a stage production, incorporating acoustic as well as electronically manipulated instruments, narration, video, and interpretive dance.  His wife, the dancer, gave a presentation (sales pitch) at a Praecepta meeting, formally requesting the funds to promote a national tour of the piece.\n\nPersonally, I didn't feel any particular claim to the funds because it was my first semester there and I didn't want to stir the pot (and I wasn't even sure I wanted to BE in the group since they were only interested in promoting experimental music), so I abstained from voting, but the others voted to give the professor HALF of what he requested, saving the rest for equipment purchase as was originally intended.  Many of the second-year grads had an agenda: to spend it all on a new sound system and new equipment for the digital studio (remember, the one that not even all the composers are allowed into).  Essentially, they wanted to blow all the money on things that only a select few individuals could even benefit from.  Needless to say, they didn't want to surrender ALL the money to our professor, whose self-serving proposal was staggeringly bold.  So they voted to give him HALF.\n\nAs a result, one of the other composition professors sent an email to the group LAMBASTING us for not giving the other professor every penny he asked for.  She said she was disappointed in us, and she went on and on about how we should be ashamed for not \"giving back\" to the professor who had \"done so much for\" us.  She demanded that we hold another meeting to RE-vote on giving him the funds.  Let's not mince words here: a professor BULLIED her students into disregarding the official rules to hold a SECOND vote to give the funds from a STUDENT organization to a PROFESSOR to promote his own music.  I call that corruption.\n\nOf course, when we reconvened to vote again, we unanimously voted to give 100% of the requested funds to our professor.  It was a kangaroo court, and we all knew why we were there: to vote unanimously in favor of the proposal.  After that, the professor who had condemned our first vote emailed the group again, this time to thank and praise us for our wise and generous decision (which sounded disingenuous, as you can imagine).\n\nThat's pretty much how things are done at BGSU.  Fear and intimidation are tools of the faculty, and the composition department has a bad habit of using Praecepta as a backdoor funding source.  The ostensible purpose of any of Praecepta's fundraisers is just a front for promoting the professors' personal careers.\n\nThe faculty care only about perpetuating their dogmatic agenda, about supporting the egos in their circle, not about nurturing the students or really getting any of them to grow into their own, to find their unique voices.  The faculty live inside a well-insulated bubble, a bottleneck culture, and the tiny sphere they have created for themselves is one that endlessly strokes and coddles their own egos like a feedback loop.  Meanwhile, at least 50% of the student body reflects the self-serving agenda of promoting only avant-garde aesthetics, and students with other interests are repressed.  One half of the student body is blissfully oblivious to the frustrations of the other half who just want equal treatment.  One half of the student body thrives, because they allow the egomaniacal faculty to mold them into their image, while the other half has an uphill battle.\n\nThis is a TERRIBLE music program.\n\nThat being said, if you are interested in limiting yourself exclusively to avant-garde thought and do not want to even be exposed to anything else, then this is the perfect school for you as a composer.  If you want a haven for experimentalism, if you love avant-garde but have been met with resistance or cynicism elsewhere and now you want to find a place of a sort of reverse-discrimination where you can flourish, then look no further, because BGSU is the place for you.  If you compose primarily experimental or avant-garde music, electroacoustic or otherwise, then you will have an easy experience here but won't learn much else, and you CERTAINLY won't end up well-rounded in your musical knowledge.\n\nIf you don\u0092t conform to their aesthetics and ideology, they will treat you like a second-class citizen.  If you aren\u0092t a sycophant, if you don't feed the egos of the self-interested faculty, you will have an exceedingly difficult time at this program.  If you have an interest in film music, concert band music, anything pre-20th Century, or even tonal music in general, you will wish you had studied someplace else.\n\nUltimately, the music program at BGSU is entirely narcissistic.  They have established a reputation as a leading voice of New Music, though only of the avant-garde persuasion.  They will absolutely NOT allow anyone to besmirch that reputation by pursuing or promoting an aesthetic or style outside the narrow scope of the avant-garde.  It is a fiercely dogmatic environment, and they work hard to keep it that way.  You would do well to apply to another university.\n\nI didn't even get to fill out a single evaluation to express any of these grievances, because they knowingly scheduled my thesis defense for AFTER the evaluations were due.  I was intimidated into silence, for fear of reprisal from the very professors who held my fate in their hands.  By that point, I just wanted to SURVIVE the program, and escape with my hard-earned Master's Degree.\n\nThus I have given my remonstrance of the music program at BGSU with explicit examples of each grievance.\n\nIn summary, you should take away from this the following ten points:\n\n1) Fiercely dogmatic ideology of what New Music should be.\n2) Narrow scope of what skills and techniques are taught or encouraged (inadequate program for a well-rounded music education).\n3) Favoritism and discrimination; students who don't feed the faculty's self-interest are treated like second-class citizens.\n4) Exclusivity; only a select few avant-garde composers ever get access to all of the university's music technology.\n5) Student body largely reflects the professors' ideology, promoting a hostile environment to the minority of tonal composers.\n6) Repression; \"silence all dissenters.\"\n7) Faculty are terrible at communicating expectations or instructions.\n8) Faculty embezzle funds from student organizations.\n9) Excellent program only for those who wish to focus exclusively on elecroacoustic/avant-garde/experimentalist music.\n10) If you insist on being an original composer, you might never graduate.

Compared to the 2012 rankings, Massachusetts Institute of Technology is now ranked in the Top 5 colleges and University of Chicago, Brown University, and Amherst College are now ranked among the Top 10 colleges.\n\nThe Top 10 institutions in the 2013 Student Choice College Rankings are:\n1. Harvard University\n2. Stanford University\n3. Yale University\n4. Massachusetts Institute of Technology\n5. Princeton University\n6. University of Chicago\n7. Brown University\n8. Caltech\n9. Amherst College\n10. U.S. Air Force Academy\n\nFor the complete 2013 Student Choice College Rankings list, visit: Parchment College Rankings 2013 | Parchment - College admissions predictions.\n\nThe 2013 Parchment Student Choice Rankings were based on a sampling of more than 200,000 college acceptances from 2009 to 2012 with data from all 50 states, an increase of 67 percent in the data set since the 2012 rankings. Unlike rankings based on subjective judgments like reputation, or factors subject to \"gaming,\" such as how many applicants a college rejects, Parchment ranks colleges and universities based solely on the decisions of hundreds of thousands of students who were admitted to multiple colleges and ultimately chose one to attend.\n\nWhen a student is admitted to several colleges, he or she must decide which school to attend. This decision reveals a preference for the chosen school compared to the other schools the student could have attended. After observing enough of these decisions, Parchment ranks the colleges based on the students' revealed preferences. This method for ranking colleges is derived from physicist Arpad Elo\u2019s rating system for chess players, which was later studied by Harvard University professors Caroline Hoxby and Mark Glickman. This results in the colleges ranked not from \u201cbest\u201d to \u201cworst,\u201d but instead from \u201cmost likely to be chosen\u201d to \u201cleast likely to be chosen.\u201d Schools can only move up in the rankings by making their programs more appealing to prospective students. The rankings system aligns the interests of colleges and students to support better match-ups.\n\nA unique result of this methodology is that all colleges can be ranked in a single list unlike the multiple lists often published by other ranking systems separating colleges arbitrarily into \u201cNational,\u201d \u201cLiberal Arts\u201d or \u201cRegional.\u201d To compare the Student Choice Rankings of any two schools, try the College Matchup app at Parchment.com.\n\n\u201cColleges can game other rankings systems \u2013 boosting their position by taking certain steps to appear more selective or have higher student test scores,\u201d said Parchment.com General Manager Brent Pirruccello. \u201cParchment\u2019s rankings provide the only list that is student-centric and equitable in that student decisions are the sole criteria used in comparing a broad-base of higher education institutions, putting them all on a level playing field.\u201d\n\nThe rankings are based on student enrollment decision data from Parchment.com, a free service students use to research colleges and discover their chances of admission, see how they compare with peers, get college recommendations, and send official transcripts when they are ready to apply.

My friend and I sat next to each other while taking the exam. Then on Thursday, we got our exams back. I got a 64 while my friend got a 62.\n\nWe had VERY similar answers. I'm not denying that. We were only 3 questions different. ((mind you this was MULTIPLE CHOICE exam)) But I DID NOT CHEAT on my exam. Who would cheat for a 64 & 62?? If my friend and I would cheat, it would at least be a 75 and up. We wouldn't risk everything for a 64.\n\nWell the teacher is big into statistics. And according to his data, it was a 1 in 10,000 chance of getting this result. So, in his mind we are already labled cheaters. But he said that he is going to allow us to retake the test seperately and if we get similar results again, it's going to clear our name. But if the results shift, we both get zeros on our exam.\n\nAm I the only one who thinks this is a horrible way of proving ourselves? There are so many factors to this that can alter the results. 1) time spent from learning the material, while learning new material. 2) nerves. A lot of pressure rides on both of us. If I don't match my friend's answers (again), which is already a 1 in 10,000 chance, we both get zeros! And he threatened us and said, \"If you withdraw from this class, I'm going to report this to Academic Misconduct\" ((Seriously, exact words)) How is he going to prove we cheated on a mutliple choice test? Because we sat next to each other? Because statistics show its highly unlikely? It's not impossible. He has no actual proof.\n\nIt just ****es me off, and I feel like no matter what, we're going to get zeros. I already don't remember my answers on the test. And I already get nervous enough my first time around. I'm going to do horrible on my second time around, in a different enviroment, with 10x more pressure on me.\n\nI was going to ask him if we could instead prove ourselves by never sitting next to each other again during an exam throughout the whole semester. Let us prove it that way. But his way just seems so unpleasent and uncomfortable. I don't see how I could ever prove I didn't cheat. :-(\n\nWhat should I do? Is it worth talking to him? Or will that just make it worse? :( "}, {"date": "2012-10-27T23:41:51+00:00", "url": "http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/sat-preparation/1408769-some-questions-about-the-score-choice-policy.html", "messages": "\n                    I actually signed up to ask this question.

It allows us to and occurs as a result of the effort to adapt to unforeseen situations in life that prove that our methodologies ought to not be set in stone.\nThroughout the time humans have existed, new paradigms in the fields of science, politics, and the social sciences have emerged. Not too long ago, the will of the people was regarded in Europe as a volatile and perhaps a pernicious base for power, as it is subject to a mind that might not know what is best for itself. Yet, it has proven its ability to check excessive power and to moderate its own revolutionary and far-right aspects on its own. Such revolutionary changes in our philosophies in politics and especially science have allowed us to remain competitive in a modern society where increasingly rapid change is required to outperform competing nations, corporations, and individuals. While changes in various fields seem to be attempts to improve performance, the individual is ironically more complex.\nWhen an individual changes his/her life for his/her own good, the same concept still applies: s/he is attempting to evolve intelligently so as to improve his/her own success. What has happened when an individual intentionally changes in a way that does not improve his fitness as a successful being in society? From a distant eye, such changes defy rational explanation unless the person\u0092s own feelings are considered. In \u0093operant conditioning\u0094, the lack of a reward that is emotionally significant results in a decreased drive for the pursuit of success on the specific path. As a result, individuals suffering from depression, ADHD, and other unfavorable situations may resort to immediate, albeit miniscule, pleasures rather than staying on the path towards long-term happiness. 21 minutes, 25 seconds\n\nDo changes that make our lives easier not necessarily make them better?\nAs our world becomes increasingly advanced technologically, computers and software is developed performing more and more complex tasks, making tasks for humans easier. Some believe that such changes in our lifestyle do not always make our lives \u0093better\u0094, but this statement\u0092s validity depends entirely upon how one defines \u0093better\u0094.\nIn the past, Romanticists have oftentimes reminded us of the nostalgic memories of the 1800s and even 1900s when there was a greater amount of leisure time. The decline of leisure has coincided with increasingly advanced technology that improved productivity of individuals, to the point where per capital productivity in the United States has increased by 90% in just the past few decades. This technology has only made the world more competitive, fast-paced, and ironically more depended upon the human mind for innovation. With modern technology, menial tasks once reserved for \u0093unfit\u0094 individuals are automated, speeding the processes required for innovation. With these tools our sea of applicable knowledge is able to grow at a faster pace than ever before. With this knowledge, we are able to strive for \u0093greatness\u0094 in our standard living and Towers of Babel. We feel \u0093rushed\u0094 in this world because our minds must be constantly stimulated to keep up with competing corporations and nations in the war for technological and political dominance. While our edifices are pierce the heavens, we do not feel happiness. The entire time we have been building upon our knowledge of the world and its surroundings, we do not feel that our life is \u0093better\u0094, not because change is a detriment to humanity, but because our standards have risen far beyond the medieval heavens. Cures for deadly diseases and new means for efficient food production have emerged because of changes in our society that have quickened the pace of our daily lives. For some, the improvement of one\u0092s life is entirely dependent upon one\u0092s perception of improvement. What we have created but have not perceived is what we have not yet created. To believe this statement however, is to refuse to connect with reality and thus to be a madman. The improvement of our standards of living over time is undeniable\u0097and so is the fact that our lives are better as a result of change that has facilitated human productivity. 25 minutes (maximum) taken                "}, {"date": "2013-04-11T10:15:29+00:00", "url": "http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/sat-preparation/1490445-can-someone-grade-my-essay.html", "messages": "\n                    It was my first attempt at writing SAT essay so I would be very grateful if somebody could grade it. Thank you in advance!\n\nPrompt:\n\nWe often hear that we can learn much about someone or something just by casual observation.\nWe are not required to look beneath the surface or to question how something seems. In fact, we are urged to trust our impressions, often our first impressions, of how a person or a situation seems to be. Yet appearances can be misleading. What \u0093seems\u0094 isn\u0092t always what is.\n\nAssignment: Is the way something seems to be not always the same as it actually is? Plan and write an essay in which you develop your point of view on this issue. Support your position with reasoning and examples taken from your reading, studies, experience, or observations.\n\nMY ESSAY:\n\nMany people tend to look at things superficially without getting a deeper insight into them. However, a famous proverb says, \u0093Don\u0092t judge a book by its cover.\u0094 In other words, the way something seems to be is not always the same as it actually is. This concept is illustrated throughout literature, technology and personal experience.\n\n\nOne compelling example of how casual observation may lead us into false perception of reality is the life of Helen Keller. A famous American writer and activist lost her sight and hearing at a very young age. Consequently, the impossibility to fully communicate made people think of her as a person with limited intellectual ability. However, it was not true for Anne Sullivan, who discovered that Helen reasoning was exactly the same as in the case of a person without any disorders. Sullivan taught Keller to speak and read, which eventually resulted in her becoming the first deaf blind person to earn a Bachelor degree. Their example may serve as a remainder so as not to form our beliefs relying on first impressions.\n\nAnother credible example of the idea that we should not be urged to trust our first impressions was the American entrepreneur and inventor Steve Jobs. His youth was riddled with frustration over formal schooling. It came to the point when his teachers needed to bribe him to study. Therefore, no one expected Jobs to become a world-renowned CEO of Apple Inc. However, he proved to be an extremely talented technologist whose devotion to computers enabled millions of people around the world to interact using his sophisticated products. Jobs is a prime example of the fact that we should look beneath the surface to learn the truth about someone or something.\n\nA final illustration of the fact that appearances can be misleading is shown in my personal experience. In my second year of high school a new student called Susan joined our class. Despite our tremendous efforts to make her feel comfortable in the new environment, she eschewed every single attempt we made to help her. Consequently, my class started to perceive her as a selfish person, unwilling to cooperate in a group. It was not until the end of the first term that we finally found out the reason for her unusual behavior. Sadly, the girl had experienced hardship in her previous school where she was awfully treated by her fellow classmates. As a result, she was afraid of creating closer relationships with anyone in our class. Only after a long talk with Susan she became more open and soon turned out to be an extremely fascinating human being. Her example taught us not to judge people too quickly.\n\nAs we have seen in these literary, technological and personal experience examples, we may often misjudge a person by relying on the first impression. It is worth remembering that things are usually different from what they seem to be. As Anne Wilson once said: \u0091\u0092Don\u0092t let your perfunctory look cover the truth about a person.\u0094                "}, {"date": "2013-04-29T19:37:20+00:00", "url": "http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/university-california-berkeley/1499254-transfer-to-berkeley-or-come-in-as-a-freshman.html", "messages": "\n                    Hi everyone! So I recently got accepted to Berkeley for Spring 2014 as a pre-Haas/pre-business major. Since I got accepted for the spring, and FPF is filled up, I would attend a community college for the first semester/quarter of my freshman year.\n\nMy main issue right now, actually, is: Should I continue at a community college for my first two years (and then transfer to Berkeley), or should I go to Berkeley starting spring semester of my freshman year?\n\nI know that to many of you reading this right now, I may sound insane. Why would I WANT to go to a community college if I've already been accepted to Berkeley? For many people at community colleges, Berkeley is the end result of community college; if I already have that end result offered to me, why would I reject and risk not getting into Berkeley in the future? Let me explain my reasoning.\n1) I know the first two years consist mainly of GE's and pre-reqs, which can easily be taken at community colleges. At CC's, I would have to do half the work, AND I'd get much better grades as well as more individualized attention from professors. Personally, I don't understand the \"downside\" or \"cons\" of bypassing GE's by taking them at a CC instead of Cal.\n\n2) I want to be a Business Administration major, and I really do not have a backup. This is because I want to go into accounting/investment banking, and the typical backup major, Econ, wouldn't provide me with the skills I need to go on in those fields. At Cal Day, I actually talked to a Cal advisor, and she told me NOT TO GO TO BERKELEY if I wanted to go into accounting because it wasn't guaranteed that I would get into Haas/get the classes I need (for certification exams and such). By applying as a third-year transfer student, I would be able to apply directly to Haas and see if I get admitted or not (as opposed to getting rejected and being left hanging).\n\n--> Add on to that: I don't consider myself the super brainy or really intellectual type, which I know most of the pre-Haas kids are. Being pre-Haas, in my mind, is like being in high school all over again (it's like a \"rat race\" to reach a desired goal): you have to keep your grades really high, get involved in tons of EC's, do leadership positions, internships...etc... but unlike high school, you're competing with just Cal kids, aka some of the smartest kids in the country. To me, that's a lot of pressure and stress, and I don't know if I'd be able to do that.\n\n3) When I was applying to schools, I thought I wanted to be a science major, so I applied to mainly science-strong schools (i.e. Davis, San Diego...etc). If given a second chance at applying, I would be able to apply to more business-strong schools (obviously Cal, USC, NYU...etc).\n\n4) Going to community college for two years would be a \"transition\" period so to say. At this point in my life, I'm not ready to go to a really good business school if it is all the way across the country, like NYU, or Columbia (even if I do get accepted). Two years later, I believe that I would be ready to do that, if that's what was best for my career.\n\nBut I also realize the cons of this potential decision. I may not get into Berkeley at all, thereby losing out on one of the best opportunities I've ever been presented with. And also, I'll miss out on the traditional \"college experience.\" I also know I'll have to deal with lots of people's judgments & criticisms but eh.\n\nPlease let me know if you know anyone whose done this (gotten in as a freshman but chosen to transfer)! I'd appreciate any opinions!

For once in my life I understood what was going on in class and scored the 2nd highest score on the final. I outscored all my peers who mocked me into misery and once told me I could never get an A.\n\nThe result of months of hard work, last fall I was proud to say I scored a well above average SAT score (2330).

So please help me set it to rest and I will be forever grateful to you.\n\nHere is my current situation:\n\nI will be a fourth year this fall at a good state school. It is no Ivy League, but it is in the top 10 public schools. I like it.\n\nThanks to a nifty scholarship I will graduate debt free.\n\nI am a double major in Applied Mathematics and Chinese. I have learned that saying your a chinese major means nothing. I have a few fellow chinese majors that would be hard pressed to hold a basic conversation. I was lucky enough to discover that actually learning a language requires much more than learning it for a class. I would say my reading, writing, and speaking skills are all around the advanced - low level (low modifying advanced).\n\nMy GPA is a 3.89\n\nDecent grades, decent school, decent skill set, what's the problem? The problem is that I have irrevocably screwed up. Now don't judge what I am about to say until you have read the whole post.

Physicist.\n\nThis is no result of physics pop culture, its a result of restoration of self. For as long as I can remember I LOVED science.  If you asked me what I wanted to be when I grew, up the answer was scientist.  I have the kindergarten work sheets to prove it. By my first year of high-school I realized that I wanted to be a physicist. My parents were concerned, they didn't think that was a \"real\" job. I didn't care. I had absolutely no doubts that I would go to college, grad school, and then become a professor ( high-school me wasn't aware of the postdoc step). But then my first semester of college happened.\n\nIt wasn't sex, drugs, or parties that got me off track. It was realizing that I could be out in the real world , making a difference, in four years instead of seven. At the root of all my goals was the desire to contribute something to this world before I died. I changed my major to Applied Maths which I thought would give me a more general tool base for problem solving, picked up a language, and never looked back...until now.\n\nI am currently spending the summer in Taiwan studying and I live by myself. It gives me a lot of time for introspection, and to really find out what I want. Unfortunately I realized that I am pretty far off the mark. Some of you might be thinking \" Come on charmp just change your major back, take a few extra years to graduate - no problem!\". Right , of course, except there are a few HUGE problems. Let me explain:\n\nThroughout all of this I have been , at heart, a physics nerd. I have filled my free electives with physics classes. I have taken your standard Physics I, Physics II, Modern Physics, and Classical Mechanics. I did well enough, receiving all A's and one B. However, I didn't learn the material like I should have if I wanted to be a physicist. I didn't take the time to play with the ideas and equations. I didn't become nearly as comfortable with the basics as I wanted.  These were free electives, I didn't prioritize them, and in the end I did the equivalent to what a lof of my friends did when learning chinese. I learned physics for the class, not for me. I Cannot retake the classes at my college, and I refuse to take more advanced classes until I have this base down packed.\n\n\"OH your Just being stubborn Charmp!\"\n\nYes, Yes I am. I know how my brain works, and I am telling you for a fact that If I do not start from scratch and work my way back up - I will NEVER make the contribution that I want to give the scientific community. Furthermore, I am not too impressed with my schools physics department. If I am going to do this, I want to do it completely correctly. So here is my question to you :\n\nWhat is my best course of action to get admitted to a college with a top-notch undergraduate physics program. Is this even possible? Should I take a few years off to make money to pay for my re-education, and obtain some real world achievements? I am absolutely dedicated to this idea, but I have no clue how to do it. Am I completely screwed ?  Sorry for the long post.\n\nTL;DR Plans after graduation - go back to school. Help.

Students choosing colleges often look at reported score ranges for the students at various colleges to decide what colleges to apply to. The National Association for College Admission Counseling (NACAC),\n\nhttp://www.nacacnet.org/MemberPortal/\n\nthe federal Department of Education Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS),\n\nhttp://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/\n\nand the Common Data Set Initiative (CDS)\n\nhttp://www.commondataset.org/\n\nhave collaborated to set common standards for colleges gathering data about admission characteristics of their applicants and reporting data about their enrolled classes each year.\n\nI see from time to time that reports about college score ranges don't always follow NACAC-IPEDS-CDS principles and practices. I wrote about this a while ago to a couple private email lists that include readers of these College Confidential forums. As I wrote then, by the National Association for College Admission Counseling (NACAC) Statement of Principles of Good Practice,\n\nhttp://www.nacacnet.org/NR/rdonlyres/9A4F9961-8991-455D-89B4-AE3B9AF2EFE8/0/SPGP.pdf\n\nand by the actual practice of the Common Data Set, colleges report only interquartile ranges for each section of the SAT, and interquartile ranges for ACT composite scores. The NACAC principle reads like this:\n\n\nThe Common Data Set instructions read:\n\n\nHowever, as I have mentioned to parents before, the very interesting Education Trust college profiles\n\nhttp://www.collegeresults.org/default.htm\n\nsuffer from a methodological error: \"The median composite ACT score is estimated by averaging the 25th percentile and 75th percentile composite ACT scores. The median combined SAT score is estimated by adding the average of the 25th and 75th percentile verbal score to the average of the 25th and 75th percentile math score, and dividing by two.\"\n\nhttp://www.collegeresults.org/aboutthedata.aspx\n\nSuch a calculated \"median\" composite score should NOT be assumed to be exactly the same as the actual median of all scores of students in that college's entering class. What the actual median is has to be determined from the data themselves, and colleges are not to report the actual medians, by NACAC principles. I have also seen attempts online to estimate 75th percentile levels for SAT composite scores, simply by summing the scores for the 75th percentile on each SAT section. I hope it is so apparent that it goes without saying why that figure may not be the same as the actual 75th percentile level of composite scores in that group of students: if various students score higher on one section than another, matching the math scores of the 75th percentile math scorers with the critical reading scores of the 75th percentile critical reading scorers may overstate the composite scores of the top quartile of students.\n\nIt's sufficient, of course, to look at the interquartile ranges to see if students with certain levels of scores have a great or meager chance of getting admitted. And once a student wraps his or her mind around how to read interquartile ranges reported for each test section, it is really much more helpful for the student's planning to know those ranges than only to know a (possibly incorrect) median composite score for a college to which the student may apply.\n\nNow let's look at some examples. The College Board College QuickFinder\n\nhttp://collegesearch.collegeboard.com/search/quicksearch.jsp\n\nprovides a way to look up college score ranges. Colleges report this information directly to the College Board according to the standardized data definitions and methodology developed under the Common Data Set Initiative. The same data go to the federal government through the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) and to U.S. News and to Petersons. You can look up any college you like on the College Board College QuickFinder, and the page about test scores will always have the most accurate interquartile ranges for the test scores considered by that college in admitting its most recent freshman class.\n\nHere are some examples, chosen on no particular basis:\n\nhttp://collegesearch.collegeboard.com/search/CollegeDetail.jsp?collegeId=1251&profileId=6\n\nhttp://collegesearch.collegeboard.com/search/CollegeDetail.jsp?collegeId=4221&profileId=6\n\nhttp://collegesearch.collegeboard.com/search/CollegeDetail.jsp?collegeId=3387&profileId=6\n\nhttp://collegesearch.collegeboard.com/search/CollegeDetail.jsp?collegeId=4075&profileId=6\n\nhttp://collegesearch.collegeboard.com/search/CollegeDetail.jsp?collegeId=3746&profileId=6\n\nhttp://collegesearch.collegeboard.com/search/CollegeDetail.jsp?collegeId=3300&profileId=6\n\nhttp://collegesearch.collegeboard.com/search/CollegeDetail.jsp?collegeId=4099&profileId=6\n\nhttp://collegesearch.collegeboard.com/search/CollegeDetail.jsp?collegeId=1713&profileId=6\n\nhttp://collegesearch.collegeboard.com/search/CollegeDetail.jsp?collegeId=2354&profileId=6\n\nhttp://collegesearch.collegeboard.com/search/CollegeDetail.jsp?collegeId=4118&profileId=6\n\nhttp://collegesearch.collegeboard.com/search/CollegeDetail.jsp?collegeId=122&profileId=6\n\nThere are hundreds more where these came from.\n\nMany colleges, right after they admit a new class, will publish a press release along the lines of \"Podunk College Admission Rate Drops to New Low: Admitted Class Is Most Outstanding Ever.\" The way this becomes how to lie with statistics is that most colleges lose the top end of their ADMITTED class to other colleges that are more desired by those admitted applicants. Many colleges have yields of enrolled students of less than 50 percent from their admittees, and all but the top colleges lose yield more from top students going to a more famous college than from bottom students playing it safe. So it is a good idea, when comparing colleges, to do as the Common Data Set does and compare figures about actually enrolled students in the most recent reporting year's freshman class for each college. That gives you your most accurate picture of what your classmates will be like if you accept an offer of admission from that college.\n\nBest wishes in your college search.

My major will be political economy and I'm looking to try and see if I can tack on some East-Asian/Japanese studies for a third major. I was accepted to Berkeley with a 3.03GPA and I thought that telling my story might be of some hope/insite to those of you out there who feel like you might have messed up.\n\nMy journey into college started the newest UC campus, UCMerced. It was the only UC I was accepted to, so I went there really as my only option. I didn't have any clear idea of what I wanted to do or even what I myself liked, but I figured I liked going on the internet a lot, so I must like computer, therefor I should do computer science...and that was before I knew there was math envolved (I failed pre-calc in high school). Needless to say, I did very poorly my first year. I ended up with Fs, Ds and a slew of Cs and only about 2 As, which was in my writing class. At that same time, I started studying Japanese randomly for no real particular reason on my free time (I will go into that later). By the end of my tenure at UCMerced, I had a 2.2GPA and was teetering on academic probation, so I withdrew from the campus while I was in good-standing.\n\nAs I said, I started studying Japanese in my free time. As luck or fate or whatever you want to call it, the community college near UCMerced has one of the largest outreach programs for Japanese students studying abroad. I was able to make a lot of friends and instead of going home, I remained in Merced and attended the community college. With the large number of Japanese students, I was able to be constantly surrounded by not just Japanese students, but also businessmen and educators from Japan. I made sure to talk with these people on a daily basis and get to know them.\n\nBy the time I had one semester at the college under my belt, I had actually gotten to the point where I was reading Japanese newspapers and watching the news and pretty much enjoying Japanese the same way I would enjoy anything in English (while looking up words in the dictionary of course). So I figured I should plan a trip to Japan. And while I was at it, I thought I may as well apply to some Japanese universities. I figured I had a horrible chance of getting into any respectable American school, so it might actually be a good idea to try some over there. So in the summer of 2010, I went to Tokyo and took university tests. I paid for the trip by being stingy and finding odd jobs to do with the Japanese businessmen (thus reinforcing my Japanese). Those jobs were basically translation work and work as a tour guide for prospective international students.\n\nSo after I came back from Japan, I started my 3rd semester in my college back at Merced. The tests I took in Japan in the summer were only a first set of tests and I actually needed to go back to Japan, right before finals week, to take more tests and sit for interviews. I made sure from the start of the semester to work hard and get to know my professors, that way they would be fine with letting me go to Japan for 2 weeks right before finals.\n\nWhile all of that was going on, I was of course in the process of writing my UC applications. My testing in Japan went from Nov 20-Dec 3. So if my memory serves me right, I actually turned my UC essays in while I was in Tokyo (weird). But this also meant that I would be applying to the UC schools with no real knowledge of if I was accepted to the universities in Japan or not, so that information was never able to make it to my essays. All I could hope for was that they saw improvement in my grades and that I took an interesting summer trip.\n\nSo, I got back to Merced from my winter Japan trip and took my finals then waited for the results from the Japanese schools. I ended up being accepted (for anyone interested, the schools were Keio and Waseda). Perhaps the most important thing that I did though while in Japan was go and talk with Japanese professors and get to know them as well (I will explain why later).\n\nAs it would turn out, Japanese schools don't take transfer units, so going there would have meant starting back from square one and of course it would mean going into a large debt. These are all things I knew before squandering thousands of dollars just to take tests and they were things I thought I wouldn't mind. But when faced with the very real decision of less secure schools and more debt and more time, I opted to stay in America.\n\nNow to fast forward to the recent future. My spring break was filled with 2 events, none of which made me happy. One was my acceptance to UCDavis. Not a bad school, my sister went there, but they happened to have some of the lowest transfer GPA requirements (2.9+), so I felt as though it was more of a consolation than something that I had worked for. Then came the news from UCLA. I was rejected. This is actually something I was expecting in all honesty. I didn't expect them to really sift through the some 50,000+ essays and find mine in the middle of all of that and take it in. So with UCLA saying \"no,\" I was certain UCBerkeley would be out of the question. The day I got rejected by UCLA, I wrote up my appeal letters for UCLA and Berkeley, emailed the professors in Japan to write appeal letters for me and was completely ready to barge through the admission offices and demand that they take a better look at my application.\n\nBut the other day, I found out that I don't have to do that. I got accepted to UCBerkeley. I have since been rejected by UCSB, UCI, UCSD, and UCSC. This showed me that a lot of the UCs have very different ways of looking at applications and in my case, UCBerkeley was the best fit.\n\nIf there is really anything that I learned from this and anything that I'd like other people to get out of are really two things: do what you enjoy and make connections. When I say do something you enjoy, I really mean do something that you absolutely love, something you can't stop doing, something that you truly could not see yourself without. It really shows in a person when they have chosen a path that is not suited to them, which is what happened to me. But that all changed the moment that I committed myself to something I really believed in passionately. Next is the part about connections. Connections can get you jobs, they can get you letters of recommendation, and they can be the start of some really meaningful relationships. I would say a good rule of thumb is to commit a few hours each week to make sure you chat with those people around you who are higher up; professors, university presidents, businessmen, etc.\n\nOn a side note and somewhat related to the connections, I have also applied to Stanford. This time I will have essays detailing everything that I did and letters of recommendation from the professors I made sure to talk with daily while in Japan. And I'll let you all know how that turns out.\n\nSo yeah, basically, to anyone who has hit any bumps in the road, just keep on working towards those things you can get excited about and I am sure something good will come your way\n\nGood luck!\n\n\nPS: For anyone interested in my course load and grades, here is a simple list of those:\n[Freshman] - UCMerced - Computer Science/Engineering\nFirst Semester (16 units): A, B, C, D\nSecond Semester (15 units): A, C, C, F and a W\nGPA: 2.25\n[2nd Year] - JC - Political Science/Econ/International stuff\nFirst Semester (12 units): A, A, A, A\nSecond Semester (13 units): A, A, A, B\n[3rd Year] - JC\nFirst Semester (15 units): A, A, A, B\nSecond Semester (7 units): A, A, A\nJC GPA: 3.85\nCumulative GPA: 3.03\n\nIn terms of clubs, I just did two:\nPTK (honors society): VP and treasurer. This is highly recommended for all transfer students. In fact, I recommend it so much that I would have to go as far as saying that you would be stupid not to join it....seriously. It's a great way to surround yourself with likeminded, hardworking students and looks amazing on your application if you can get a leadership position.\nInternational Club: VP. This is the one I was actually passionate about.\n\nNotes: I had to take a really light course load at my current college because I was close to having over 80 units. If you go over 80 units before transferring, it tends to automatically disqualify you for going to UCs. But I also had to spread classes out of two years to make sure I could do all of my Japanese school stuff at the same time.

I\u0092ve decide to repost this with updates because some things have changed and the application is coming out soon so there will probably be increased interest in this in the near future. This is cross-posted from AoPS as well.\n\nGeneral Updates: The biggest change is that the program will be six weeks instead of eight this summer. The change is occurring because Ohio State is changing its academic calendar so Ross needs to be out of the dorms by the beginning of August. I\u0092m not sure how this will affect the program other than less material will be covered and the program will be somewhat cheaper. The other important changes would be the change in hours of the student union food options and the prohibition on using library computers. Two years ago, the food options in the student union, which is generally considered to have the best food, were open all seven days. Last year it was closed on weekends and you had to eat at the inferior north commons during the weekends. Additionally, two years ago we were allowed to use the computers in the Science & Engineering Library. Last year we were not. I do not know what will happen next year but my guess would be is that it will be like last year. I have corrected some typos throughout the document. I added some additional comments throughout the document and marked them with [NEW: _____]. I would also welcome comparative experiences from anyone who went to PROMYS particularly if they\u0092ve been to Ross as well. I\u0092m also happy to answer any questions you may have.\n\n\n\n\nOver the past year I've posted a lot about my experience at Ross last summer both on the site and at CC as UMTYMP student. Given that the responses are in like 8 threads on two sites I've decided to try and collect all my responses in one thread. This will also be posted on college confidential.\n\nFrom the 2010 Ross thread on college confidential\n\nshushugah, I don't think it makes sense to compare the camps from best to worst. The camps cater towards different interests. For example, if you want to spend 8 weeks doing math almost constantly Ross is probably the best choice. But if you want to do things that aren't math related Ross isn't as good of a choice. From what I've heard HCiSSM places a large emphasis on its inside jokes and having fun. Awesome Math seems very geared towards competitions. Mathcamp seems to focus on various interesting subjects of math. Ross and PRMOYS are both entirely number theory. Another consideration is whether you prefer to work alone or in groups. At Ross working in groups is generally looked down upon. Often times at Ross you might spend hours or even days working alone on one particular problem. My understanding is that the doesn't really happen at other camps. While spending 8 days on one problem like I did at Ross last year might simulate actual research it wouldn't be very helpful in terms of math competitions.\n\nIn terms of instructors, I'm only familiar with Ross. The instructors are good but most of the learning you do by yourself anyways so they're not that important.\n\n\nGlad to have helped. At Ross, there is an hour of lecture each day and 3 days a week there is a 1 hour seminar. The lectures generally either explain new concepts, explore interesting tangents, or will go over old problem sets. The seminars are run by different people and some of them explore more tangential stuff like set theory while others focus on discussions of problems from the problem sets. Another important thing to note is that you work at your own pace. Oftentimes, a lecture will go over a proof from an old problem set so if you're going at a fast pace you'll have proved it by yourself but if you're going slower they'll give you the proof sometimes.\n\nFrom the 2011 Ross thread on college confidential\n\n\nThe instructors are professors either at OSU or nearby colleges.\n\n\n@kgppra053420 Essentially, the Ross program is doing number theory problem sets. The only required activities are 1-2 hours of class per day Monday-Friday. The rest of your time you can spend as you like though you will be expected to spend a lot of it working on the problem sets. The problem sets are composed of a mixture of numericals, where you will look at patterns and formulate conjectures and theorems to prove. Some of the problems are trivial, while others are extraordinarily difficult. After you finish a problem set, you'll turn it in to your counselor. Then after a day or two usually you will meet with your counselor and discuss the set. Although different counselors have very different methods for doing this, you will usually be expected to redo any problems you didn't solve correctly the first time. The rest of your time can be spent exercising, with friends, or doing other stuff although generally you won't have too much time for this. The quality of life is also pretty good. You'll get a 2-room dorm and will have 1 roommate. You'll also get a meal card, which allows you to get more than enough food. The food is also of pretty quality as well but the lack of choices can get old by the end of the summer. If you have any more specific questions, I'd be happy to answer them as well.\n\n[NEW: On weekends the food quality can be pretty bad]\n\n\nThe facilities are pretty decent. Our dorm building last year was pretty old but the dorm rooms themselves were nice and had a bedroom with bunk beds, a study room, and a bathroom. There was some communal rooms in the dorm where a lot of people would hang out. Although I never went to the athletic center, I heard it was of excellent quality. The student center where most people ate is also very new. Sets can either be done alone or in groups of people of like 2-3 people although there are no hard rules regarding this. You certainly would be able to work with your roommate as long as both of you pulled your own weight but not nobody will force you to work with them or anyone else for that matter.\n[NEW: We were in the same dorm last year and it\u0092s getting worse. There were some problems with the dorm that didn\u0092t really affect things. Hopefully we will be in a different dorm this summer.]\n\n\n@kgppra053420 Ross is pretty strict about not letting you bring laptops. If you have a specific purpose that you'll need one for they may allow you to bring it for that purpose only. However, while it is not exactly true that there are computers in the dorm, you can go to the campus library to use computers. Although the counselors will be unhappy if you spend too much time using the computers, you will be able to use them for pretty much whatever you want to do.\n[NEW: Counselors will be unhappy if you spend any time using computers at the library. Additionally, you can\u0092t really use them as they now require passwords which you won\u0092t have. If you have an actual need to use one you will be able too though.]\n\n\nYou will probably initially be a bit behind but you should be able to catch up pretty quickly if you are well prepared. Some people came late last year and it certainly didn't affect them by the end of the summer. I am not positive that they will send you the work you miss but I've heard that other places and would think that it is probably true.\n\n\nI don't think Ross is terribly strict on its no leaving policy. If you have a good reason, they should be fine with it. If your reason is not so good, they'll probably grumble but let you go anyways.\n\n\nThe Ross program gives a list of course topics here: The Ross Mathematics Summer Program for high school students, held on The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio. I wouldn't worry about looking like an idiot due to lack of talent. Ross will only accept people who will be able to do decently well if they work. The people who do the worst at Ross are without exception those who are too lazy to work hard. I wouldn't recommend studying number theory before coming to Ross; you'll do more than enough number theory at Ross. However, if you want to prepare for Ross I would recommend working on proof writing. I think you'd be better off studying something like logic or set theory before coming to Ross.\n\nRoss will not allow you to bring a laptop for gaming. Although playing games on library computers is technically prohibited and will make the counselors like you less, plenty of people do it anyways and they won't actually stop you.\n[NEW: No gaming anymore due to prohibition on using library computers discussed above.]\nPeople spend wildly varying amounts of time on the problem sets. Some people might only spend a couple of hours a day on math although those people don't do that well. Others will spend like 12 hours a day every day on problem sets. I think it takes the average Ross student 2-3 days to do a set although there is wide variation. You can work in groups or by yourself. Although it is kinda frowned upon if you come up with the solutions with other people it is not prohibited and it is certainly acceptable to bounce ideas off other people. People at Ross are on about every schedule imaginable. Some people work in the morning and afternoon and relax in the evening. Personally, my schedule was roughly like this\n9 AM wake up and go to classes\n10-11 AM after classes have lunch\n12 PM go back to the dorm and take a nap\n4 PM wake up and either work or go to the library to use computers\n6 PM dinner\n7 PM -4 AM work on problem sets\n4 AM go to bed. Every week there is a frisbee game and some weeks there is another scheduled activity. For the most part though, free time is yours to use as you wish. Some people like to go the gym or hang out. You can also take a break more or less whenever you want as long as you remain productive.\n\n\nStudents are not allowed off campus without a counselor. However, there is a CVS on the far side of campus and counselors routinely take people to the closer one as well. There is a also a university bookstore on campus but I think those are only two place you'll have easy access to. There is a movie theater near campus but I don't think students are normally allowed to go there. Essentially, there are 5 major rules at Ross:\n1. Get problem sets done at a reasonable rate\n2. Don't leave campus without a counselor\n3. Be in the dorms after dark\n4. Go to the 1-2 hours of classes a day.\n5. Don't possess prohibited items such as laptops.\nOther than those 5 rules, your behavior at Ross is more or less unrestricted.\n\n\nThere are no classes, so most people sleep in. You're expected to work on math for part of the time but the rest of the time is free. I guess at Ross the line between free time and math time is very blurred. Some camps might be like 4-6 work on math and then 6-8 free time but at Ross other than for classes all the time is free but you're expected to get stuff done. There were certainly weekends where I was on set [at Ross you're said to be on set if you've finished all the problem sets handed out so far. in the beginning there are typically a small group of people on set which shrinks until more or less everyone is no longer on set] and spent little to no time during math. Even if you are never on set, you could probably take a day or two off from math if you really wanted to.\n\n\nI'll be coming back as a junior counselor. I'm not sure if you're allowed to use all the athletic facilities but I know you're allowed to go the main gym center. I think some people played tennis but I'm not sure. I assume you'd be allowed to bring a racket but again I'm not really sure. To be honest, I never used the athletic facilities although I think almost everyone else did.\n\nSo my friend tells me you're allowed to use 'Everything but rock wall, basically'.\n[NEW: I actually went to the athletic facilities once last summer. They\u0092re really nice and you\u0092re allowed to use them but you must resist the temptation to spend too much time there or you will invoke the wrath of the counselors.]\nFrom the thread PROMYS, ROSS, or mathcamp on art of problem solving\n\n\n\nthink nikeballa96 describes Mathcamp and PROMYS pretty accurately but isn't as familiar with Ross. I went to Ross last summer and will return this summer as a junior counselor. Another important difference between the camps is how much time is spent learning techniques and theorems compared to how much time is spent proving theorems. My understanding is that Mathcamp is more like a regular math class in this regard and that classes due to their short length just go over the major results. At Ross however you'll spend most of your time coming up with proofs. I think PROMYS is somewhere in between in that every day you try to prove some theorems and then you get solutions at the end of the day. I would agree that if you're into competition math then go to Mathcamp. If you want to focus on number theory than either PROMYS or Ross. I would say go to PROMYS if you care about having fun but go to Ross if you want to truly learn math as the longer and more intensive experience allows you to come up with some really deep ideas.\n[NEW: Some of the counselors last summer have previously been at PROMYS. You don\u0092t actually receive solutions at the end of every day but instead you move on anyways. Near the end of PROMYS I think people typically focus on 1 or 2 themes that build on each other but I\u0092m not really sure.]\n\n\nMaybe this is just my skewed perspective but I'm not sure PROMYS is just as intense as Ross. For one Ross is about 2 weeks longer than PROMYS which is something to consider. Maybe I am mistaken but I was under the impression that at PROMYS every day you get a problem set, work on it and then at the end of the day go over it with your counselor. Maybe this is wrong but at PROMYS is everyone working the same set? At Ross you spend as much time as it takes to solve all the problems on the set which can is some cases be more than a week. This leads to by the end of camp some people being on set 30 and others on set 10.\nI agree that both are overall at the same level and have similar levels of students. I think there are stylistic differences between the camps though as some people from PROMYS have talked about spending time exploring Boston. I'm sure that's what some people want to spend their summer doing but that's not what people at Ross do.\n[NEW: See previous new comment. I maintain that Ross is slightly more intense than PROMYS but only mildly. The Ross counselors who had previously gone to PROMYS agreed with this sentiment too.]\nFrom the thread PROMYS and Ross on art of problem solving\n\n\nFor a general overview of the two programs, you should look at each program's individual thread and the thread comparing Mathcamp, PROMYS, and Ross. Ross and PROMYS are actually pretty similar as PROMYS was created to be like Ross. Here are some differences though\n1. Ross is 8 weeks and PROMYS is 6 weeks. This allows you to do considerably more math at Ross but at the cost of more of your summer. I think the programs charge similar amounts of money so Ross is considerably cheaper per day.\n2. Ross is Columbus, Ohio and PROMYS is in Boston. Although Columbus, Ohio has to be one of the most boring places in the US, the lack of interesting surroundings helps you focus on math. I heard at PROMYS people explore Boston which may be exciting but probably does not encourage doing math.\n3. At Ross, first years are not allowed to bring laptops. I think PROMYS allows first years to bring laptops. I can imagine that laptops would significantly cut down on mathematical productivity although they would allow you to play more games. At Ross you can still use computers in the library but you have to be in the dorms after dark. At Ross you can also get yelled out for playing computer games. I do not know the policy for this at PROMYS.\n4. At Ross first years focus pretty much exclusively on the number theory problem sets. According to the PROMYS thread, some first years at PROMYS do some kind of research thing which does not seem directly related to the number theory problem sets.\n5. At Ross you work at your own pace so different people can be working on very different stuff at any given time. By the end of the camp, the number of sets people have done resembles a bell curve. The top students are usually on sets 25-30 (there are 31 sets and typically one student every 2-3 years finishes all the sets). the good students are on sets 20-25, the average students on sets 15-20, and the lazy students fail to finish 15. At Ross if you do something wrong on a set you end up redoing the problem.\nI'm not entirely sure how PROMYS works so if someone who went there can correct me if I'm wrong about this that's be great but I think at PROMYS you get a problem set every day similar to Ross but then you go over it with your counselor at the end of the day. I think this means that at PROMYS everyone is on roughly the same set and if you don't solve a problem you'll eventually get a solution for it.\n\nIn conclusion, I think at Ross you'll end up doing more math while at PROMYS you'll end up doing more other stuff.\n\nIf you have questions that aren't answered in any of these posts feel free to ask and I'll do my best to answer them.\n\n[NEW: See previous new comments on PROMYS. Ross is no longer 8 weeks so that difference no long matters. Ross is now somewhat cheaper than PROMYS though. I heard first years are not allowed laptops at PROMYS but I\u0092m not sure how strictly that\u0092s enforced.]                "}, {"date": "2006-10-07T14:31:32+00:00", "url": "http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/college-confidential-cafe/246290-why-vote-at-all-mathematically-it-makes-little-difference.html", "messages": "\n                    Voting for philosophical or moral reasons aside, there are actually very few reasons to vote this or in any upcoming election from a purely mathematical standpoint.\n\n10 people vote for a leader, every vote effectively holds 10% of the power right?

We are not required to look beneath the surface or to question how something seems. In fact, we are urged to trust our impressions, often our first impressions, of how a person or a situation seems to be. Yet appearances can be misleading. What ?seems? isn?t always what is.\n\nIs the way something seems to be not always the same as it actually is? Plan and write an essay in which you develop your point of view on this issue. Support your position with reasoning and examples taken from your reading, studies, experience, or observations.\n\n\nMy essay:\nPeople always trust their first impressions, and they simply use these impressions to judge a person or analysis a situation. Though these actions will save much time, the results may not be satisfying because people are always misled by their first impressions. Things are not always seem to be the same as they actually is. In order to get a holistic view of a person or a situation, we should not only believe our first impressions, but also look into the matter deeply.\nI once read a story about a reporter who wanted to find the laziest person in the city and then write a paper to criticize the person on the newspaper. He went to the outskirt of the city; there he happened to find a man was slowly watering a very small square of vegetable field in the warm afternoon sun. How indolent the man was, the journalist thought after observing him for a few minutes. The man only did very little work so tardily and cost almost a whole afternoon doing this. The reporter was quite excited because he thought he had found the very person he wanted to repudiate on the newspaper.\nBut as he was leaving for home, he glimpsed at the man again, from another aspect, he was surprised to find that the man was a disabled man, and the poor man only had one hand and one leg. He was lying on a stick and moving stiffly?he was using all his effort to do a matter that might seem very easy for a normal person. The reporter was deeply moved. As he wrote on his paper, thanks to the second look, he found a man who is industrious, persevering and sublime. From then on, the journalist never wrote any paper just based on simply first impression, in stead, he always made an insightful investigation into the matter before reporting it. From this story, we can easily conclude that things are not always the same as they actually are.\nFurther more, in my own experience, the similar situation happened. Last semester, a girl called Violet transferred into our class. I found her ugly in some degree just at the first time I saw her. Her head was twice as big as mine; her face was pale, dotted with two small eyes hardly recognizable she also had a pointed nose that resembled a man?s, and a curved mouth which was the only part that looked fine.\nBut later, Violet and I became good friends after several months of contact. And as time passed by, I began to realize Violet?s unique beauty. Her eyes were small as usual, but were bright and warm; her lips became thin when she spoke and wore very cute; and the shin on her face was white, clean and juicy. I am convinced now Violet is beautiful. Besides, she is very kind. Her warm personality adds more to her special beauty. Violet is truly an angel.\nMy own experience tells me that man can not only be judged by first impression, and something seems to be not always the same as it actually is.\nThough people always judge things by first impression, these actions are wrong in some cases. From literature story and my own experience, I am convinced that something seems to be not always the same as it actually is. We should make further investigations before we make final conclusions.

I felt my foot twist inward terribly and remember a kind of crunch. I had the sense as it was happening to quickly try to move my weight to the other leg, but I did hurt the foot pretty bad. I actually cried for a half an hour from the pain. After icing for awhile, I took a hot bath and relaxed. I actually felt better in the tub, but when I got out and stood up, I actually cried again from the pain of what felt like the blood going to my foot.\n\nIf I were to describe what it feels like happened, it feels like someone twisted off my foot and then stuck it back on, and the nerves are still protesting.\n\nAfterwards, when I flexed my toes (could do it, but hard), I felt a pulling all along the underside of my foot, up the back of my heel, to my lower calf. I had some swelling near my outer ankle the following day, but nothing else visible to speak of, other than pain and limping. I opted not to go to a doctor because it seemed obvious that I could still move my foot and walk.\n\nAnyhow, it's been almost 3 weeks now. I am getting around ok with just a slight limp. I only have a real problem with going down the stairs and bearing weight directly on that leg to do so. Trying to put my foot into my sneaker and the resultant pushing of foot to calve is very painful to the entire area encircling my foot, but otherwise, the chronic pain seems to focus on the area of my achilles tendon. What is most distressing is that this is my dominant leg/driving foot.\n\nAnyhow, until this happened, I was engaging in regular aerobic exercise and yoga. This is absolutely essential to my mental and physical health. While I know that I could do strength training purely for exercise, this total cessation of aerobics has undoubtedly caused an endorphin crash and I am feeling depressed and insomnia is kicking in, something that I had completely gotten rid of with exercise and a natural diet. 2 years ago, I was huffing and puffing walking to the corner, could not last on a treadmill for 2 minutes without my heart rate soaring dangerously. Before this injury, I had reached a point where I could last an hour at at a brisk aerobic level and was almost running. I simply cannot mentally take returning to my former situation. I tried gentle yoga earlier in the week and was in pain. Research revealed that you actually cannot stretch out these kinds of problems and that it can aggravate the situation. So I do not have that either, and I am miserable.\n\nI realize that I do not want an Achilles tendon rupture nor a chronic problem, so I've avoided all but walking. If this does not get significantly better in another week, I will go see an orthopedist, but from what I've read, there is little to be done but painkillers and rest. If I had actually ruptured it, I wouldn't be walking at all.\n\nCan anyone make some suggestions on ways to bring my heart rate to an aerobic level without harming this foot? I'd swim, but I'm not a strong swimmer, and the chlorine at the pool bothers my asthma. I also think that flapping my foot to swim would also hurt because the top of my foot where it connects to my calve hurts too when it is engaged.

She and I really don't get along.\n\nI don't like her teaching style nor her personality.  She has an \"elite\" group of favorites in her classes, usually the popular and talkative kids, and she only pays attention to them.  She doesn't really know the rest of us exist and it makes me and other students in my class feel really bad when a teacher doesn't take even an effort to get to know her quieter students (and usually harder-working) as well.  I've had her for 7 weeks now and she still doesn't know my name.  This really frustrates me, when a teacher goes so far to ignore a mass majority of her kids.\n\nEven the way she looks annoys me.  She has something to her face that implies that she thinks she is better than me, and she is just so condescending and rude to me when I am really sweet to her.  One day I approached her after class and said \"Hello\" just to see if she knew I existed.  In return, she gave me the rudest look ever that just gave away so much about her opinion of me (oh, and she never said \"Hi\").  Basically her look said, \"You're crap.  You don't deserve to talk to me or be in my presence.  Why are you even human, why do you have to exist in our world?  You don't deserve to be alive.\"   That was the impression I got, from me just giving her a friendly \"Hello\".  How awful is that?\n\nThis is math, by the way.  I don't know about your high schools, but at my high school, honors or AP math classes are pretty much always viewed as the hardest, most rigorous classes.  The classes move so fast that getting regular extra help from a teacher is inevitable at some point for every student.  After today, having to be around my teachers horrible attitude, I have decided for good that I am never going to ask for help from again--never.\n\nI couldn't get her fired, a lot of people actually like her and think she's good at teaching.  Sure I've had quips about teachers in the past, but I've never actually had a teacher who goes THIS far.  She's horrendous in that she just doesn't care.  It actually baffles me how rude she is to ME, especially, as if she has something to hold against me.  She doesn't even treat the other quiet students this badly.  I am really a genuinely nice person and I treat her a lot of with respect, yet she just can't seem to get herself to get along with me.  She has actually called on me in class (or rather, rashly pointed her pencil at me because why would she know my name?) and tormented me for not knowing the answer to a problem.  What she said right after that was basically equivalent to calling me dumb and a failure at life in front of the entire class.  As a result, I feel really uncomfortable just being in her classroom.\n\nMy math teacher last semester was so sweet and helpful, and I kind of want to go into her class for help, but I'm afraid my current teacher will come in and visit (teachers of the same subject generally hang around each others' classrooms at my school) and see me, and everything will be awkward.  Should I risk this?\n\nAnyway, just in general, I wanted to rant because I have a C and now almost a D in math, 2 weeks left of the marking period, and I've only ever gotten 1 B in high school.  She piles on homework every single night and math in that class is like Greek to me, so it's like deciphering a bunch of Greek novels at 1am after a long, arduous day of tutoring and Community Service Club or whatever activities I have that day.  Get this--she likes to give out really hard homework \"for fun\".  I once spent literally 5 hours trying to figure out a page of problems, and the next day she laughs and says \"Oh, I just gave that out for fun!\"  One time I also asked for help on a quiz when we had 1 minute left in the class, and she told me to be quiet because I was being a distraction while she helped this popular kid.\n\nI really despise this teacher, and I am probably going to have this math teacher next year as well.  I actually happen to despise my guidance counselor as well because she never does anything for me and would never allow me to switch teachers, so scratch that option off the list.\n\nIf anyone has gone through anything similar with a teacher, please share your story.   Thanks so much if anyone takes the time to read this entire post and offers some advice, I really appreciate it.

I made this account specifically for this post, as some of the things I will say may be controversial and I don\u2019t want to be forever associated with it.\n\nNow, I\u2019ve seen lots of reflections and advice threads for elite college admissions, and having just been through the process myself, I thought I\u2019d add a bit of my own.\n\nAlong with the many hours I\u2019ve spent browsing CC, I\u2019ve worked extensively with a well-respected college admissions consultant and was accepted to multiple HYPS schools, so I imagine my advice will differ somewhat from what\u2019s commonly accepted on CC.\n\nEverything I say will apply to the UNHOOKED applicant applying to elite colleges.\n\nWithout further ado:\n\nMINDSET\nYes, it\u2019s important to have back up schools, but that much is obvious. But what\u2019s more often overlooked is the fact that you shouldn\u2019t be applying to these schools unless you feel like you have a fair shot at admissions. Admittedly, an overwhelming majority of people with fair shots get rejected, but the matter of importance is your mindset. Don\u2019t consign yourself to rejection before April 1st (or whenever the school will announce its decisions).\n\nSecondly, it\u2019s important to also realize that THE SMALL THINGS MATTER. So many times have I come across CC where someone asks about whether to send this SAT score or that SAT score, whether to devote more time to this EC or that, and, most of the time, CC\u2019ers respond by telling posters that it doesn\u2019t matter, that the difference is so marginal that adcoms won\u2019t care. That\u2019s the wrong mindset. If applicants approached college admissions with this mindset, a lot of small things could be overlooked and build up to make a large difference. On the other side, if you work at perfecting even the small things, they build up and can make a large difference. Of course, focus on the most important parts of your application (test scores, essays, etc.) but the smaller things such as presentation or the order in which you present your EC\u2019s (serial positioning effect) or which subject tests look better should also receive attention. For example, yes, the difference between 760 Math II SAT and the 750 Physics SAT may appear marginal to the national average, but, given the huge curve of the Math II SAT and given the sheer number of test takers for the Math II test, a 760 in Math II looks much worse than a 750 in Physics, which is generally a more difficult test with a smaller curve. Small things like that DO matter. What\u2019s more, most applicants are on the fence \u2013 it\u2019s not like they\u2019re all definite rejections or definite acceptances, so if a small aspect of your application like that could provide the tip factor, then it\u2019s definitely worth considering.\n\nThirdly, it\u2019s all about standing out, which for many unhooked applicants, means being as UN-Asian as possible. Forgive my lack of political correctness, but there are simply too many Asians applying to elite schools in comparison to the percentage of Asians in the general US population. As such, it\u2019s about moving away from the stereotypically Asian activities. How many times do you think adcoms have seen a tennis-playing, 12-year piano loving, math/science studying Asian/Indian applicant? How many times do you think adcoms have seen even prestigious awards such as Intel semi-finalists or high AIME scores? A quick story, an Asian friend of mine was a semi-finalist in both the Intel and Siemens competition and did pretty well on the AIME, along with taking 22 AP exams and being valedictorian \u2013 he was rejected from HYPSM (yes, all 5). Quite frankly, all that\u2019s been done before and done better. I, on the other hand, was not valedictorian, did not even participate in Intel/Siemens or anything of the sort, but was accepted to multiple HYPS schools because I devoted my time to more unique activities.\n\nTHE TANGIBLES\nCollege admissions seems to focus much less on the tangibles now than they have done in the past. High test scores and good ranks and a slew of AP classes are a prerequisite for elite colleges, not the deciding factors.\n\nThat said, many here on CC (I used to be one of them) believe that above 2300, scores are treated roughly equally and that getting a slightly higher score isn\u2019t worth it. However, after talking to my consultant, it turns out that colleges DO factor in minute differences in SAT scores (after all, various college rankings factor in average SAT scores of admitted students). Simply put, the higher your scores, the higher your chances, even if only marginally (remember, small things add up). Of course, there comes the opportunity cost of preparing to take another test versus devoting time to writing your essays or sponsoring that charity event, and the costs and benefits of taking another test should be analyzed on a case by case basis. Generally speaking, if you believe you can increase your score by even 40 points, it\u2019s definitely worth it to retake the test.\n\nAlso, not all subject tests are perceived equally. Getting an 800 on Math II means a lot less than getting an 800 on Chinese as a non-native speaker. The differences in scores and difficulties on certain tests should also be considered on a case by case basis, but generally speaking, you want the highest scores on the hardest tests.\n\nAs for course rigor and class rank, it\u2019s ideal to have the highest class rank in the most rigorous classes, but sometimes that\u2019s not possible \u2013 as when schools fail to rank on weighted GPA\u2019s. In a situation like that, course rigor is more important than class rank, though your rank should be as high as possible. You can have your counselor explain the ranking system and the adcoms are likely to understand why it\u2019s a lot tougher being valedictorian with 7 AP classes in your schedule as opposed to someone who stuffs his schedule full of basket weaving courses.\n\nIf you\u2019ve taken an AP class but did poorly on the exam, it\u2019s still better to report it. You don\u2019t want colleges thinking you\u2019re concealing a 1. The weight colleges give to AP exam scores are debatable, but, as always, you want to do as well as you can. A string of 5\u2019s can only look impressive.\n\nEXTRACURRICULARS\nThe most basic tenet of EC\u2019s is that passion is more important than well-roundedness. In fact, my consultant has even mentioned that being president of 5 clubs can sometimes work AGAINST you \u2013 as they can indicate a lack of dedication and mere resume padding on your part. But what receives less attention is the fact that your EC\u2019s should be UNIQUE as well.\n\nMoreover, most people will tell you not to worry about college admissions in your freshman/sophomore year of high school, but, actually, one of the best ways to demonstrate passion is consistency of participation. If you've done something for all 4 years, it definitely shows resolve and dedication. It's never too early to start thinking about the process.\n\nI think there are three specific things adcoms look for when it comes to EC\u2019s: talent, potential, and uniqueness. It definitely helps to be a USIMO gold medalists or an Olympic-qualifying figure skater, but talent isn\u2019t the end-all. If you can convey a genuine passion and demonstrate the potential to excel in a given field, that can sometimes compensate for the lack of national awards. That said, it\u2019s always better to have the prestigious awards to prove your ability.\n\nRegarding uniqueness, remember, it\u2019s all about standing out. This is where I\u2019ll start to diverge from traditional CC wisdom. Yes, it\u2019s great to do what you love, but it\u2019s also important to stand out to adcoms. I know many here are diametrically opposed to what they view as \u2018gaming\u2019 the college admissions system, but, really, how can you expect applicants not to consider how to stand out? It\u2019s not \u2018gaming\u2019 the system, it\u2019s being different. Let\u2019s be real here, how much more difficult is it for an excellent Asian math whiz to stand out than a mediocre Hawaiian flame-eater? No, I\u2019m not saying DON\u2019T pursue math and science if you love it, but, unless you\u2019re nationally recognized or something, you should also pursue activities that are more unique, or, at the very least, you should make use of your common EC\u2019s in a different way. Yes, my college admissions consultant agreed with the statement and even recommended to me certain EC\u2019s that will stand out. It\u2019s not always about simply doing what you love for college admissions, though, that being said, doing what you love will generally yield the best results in terms of awards and accolades. In the event that it doesn\u2019t, do something else.\n\nGenerally speaking, jobs aren\u2019t terribly unique, especially when you\u2019re tutoring kids or working at a mall, and especially when you\u2019re working just for some extra spending money. On the flip side, if you\u2019re actually working to support your family or working to pay for your tuition, that can be a plus, as it demonstrates resolve and maturity.\n\nAt most internships, no matter how good you might think they look, colleges will know that high school seniors won\u2019t be doing much but observing. Even if you intern at a law firm, it won\u2019t help too much. That said, for all of your EC\u2019s, it\u2019s about what you take away from them, so if you manage to get a lot out of your internship and can write a good essay about it, it\u2019s not time wasted.\n\nMoreover, joining school clubs isn\u2019t all that important unless you actively contribute and make unique differences. The same applies for any community service activities. For example, NHS, generally speaking, is completely worthless and hardly worth a spot on the EC section (in fact, many of the students admitted to top colleges in my school decided to quit after a year). The same goes for filing x-rays in a hospital or shadowing a physician \u2013 they\u2019re overdone and simply not impressive. Working at soup kitchens, tutoring kids in math, and organizing fundraisers for cancer awareness, though very worthy causes, are also overdone.\n\nThat said, it\u2019s also about HOW you do these things. Instead of sitting behind a counter filing paperwork at your hospital, why not use your musical talent and play your violin in the recovery ward? (That\u2019s what I mean by taking a common EC and using it in a different way.) Instead of tutoring your neighbor\u2019s kid or another student in your school, why not get involved in programs that allow you to teach inner-city kids (I take this example from an actual case)? Instead of selling coupons or sending envelopes to neighbors or organizing marathons, why not make use of your artistic talent and sell your artwork in order to raise money for a cause?\n\nIt\u2019s all about being unique.\n\nESSAYS\nIt\u2019s debatable what the most important part of the application is, but for applicants who lack very prestigious awards or unusual talents, essays are THE deciding factor \u2013 this is where you demonstrate your uniqueness, your personality, your leadership, your potential.\n\nAgain, I\u2019ll diverge from traditional CC wisdom when I say, no, it\u2019s not all about being yourself. The initial draft of my Common App essay, I felt, was genuinely me \u2013 it was real and raw and reflected how I viewed myself and how I viewed my world. But upon having the draft returned to me, I was forced to scrap it entirely \u2013 as it was too bitter and too biting and would portray me in a negative light to the admissions committee. It is EXTREMELY important to consider how the admissions committees will view you upon reading your essay. Generally, you want to come off as someone with potential, with character, and with a love for mankind. NEVER write about issues like depression or suicidal thoughts. This isn\u2019t the place for your negative emotions and this definitely isn\u2019t the place to just be you. Political correctness, as much as I despise it, DOES matter in these essays. If you can make the adcoms laugh, you\u2019re already one huge step ahead of everyone else. If you make the adcoms think \u201cHmm, I\u2019ve never thought of it that way\u201d or \u201cOh, what a cool idea,\u201d then you\u2019re definitely in a good spot. Also remember, it\u2019s about standing out. I\u2019ve seen a very successful essay written in the form of a play \u2013 in one fell swoop, the applicant showed the applicant his personality while also demonstrating his skill and passion as a playwright.\n\nNow, no one can say for sure what the best topics are, but as a general rule of thumb, your essay should correspond with your EC section \u2013 it\u2019s best to write about a unique passion that shows the adcoms something about you in the process. Admittedly, that\u2019s not always the case, as there have been successful essays talking about thinking in the shower and whatnot. Moreover, if you\u2019ve overcome significant adversity, it\u2019s definitely worthwhile to write about it (that said, you shouldn\u2019t purposely pit yourself against certain obstacles just so you can write about how you overcame them).\n\nDo NOT write about the person who influenced you the most. 1) It\u2019s very easy to get off track and talk more about the person than about how said person influenced you. 2) The essay is supposed to show the adcoms something about YOU, and it can be difficult doing that when talking about someone else.\n\nDo NOT write about mental illnesses (too much liability on the part of the college).\n\nFor Asian/Indian applicants, do NOT write about your heritage/your culture. Sorry, but it\u2019s overdone and it\u2019ll be very difficult to stand out with an essay like that. On the flip side, if you happen to be a URM, then this could be a very potent essay.\n\nDo NOT write about your love for piano or the beauty you find in the intricacies of mathematics/physics or why you want to be a doctor. Again, overdone.\n\nDo NOT write about how you plan to cure cancer or end world hunger. Both difficult to believe and overdone.\n\nWhy X essays should be as specific as possible. CC generally believes that there\u2019s no point in naming specific professors, but it\u2019s actually beneficial to be able to talk about specific projects certain professors have worked on. The more you know about the school, the easier it is for the adcoms to believe you actually want to attend.\n\nThe 150 word activity essay should briefly highlight your major contributions AND what you\u2019ve learned and how you\u2019ve developed through said activity.\n\nThere are so many more pieces advice I can think of for the essay section, but I\u2019ll simply cap this off by saying, take your essays with a grain of salt. Have others read over them. Ask them what they\u2019d think of you if they never met you and had only the paper to judge your personality. Do NOT covet your essay in secrecy, as that can be the biggest folly of all. Also, do NOT think your essay is the greatest piece of work ever created. I\u2019ve seen SO many posts on CC where applicants readily describe their essay as \u201cgreat\u201d or \u201camazing\u201d or \u201cteacher said it was the best thing he\u2019s read in his entire career.\u201d Sorry, but it\u2019s simply not true. VERY few essays are of that caliber, and your entire essay depends on how the adcoms perceive you through your words. Thus, as beautifully written as it is, if it doesn\u2019t convey the right image, it\u2019s no good.\n\nOTHER FACTORS\nAdditional information/supplementary material: I\u2019d refrain from providing too much additional information. No, I don\u2019t think the old age adage \u201cthe thicker the file, the thicker the applicant\u201d is true, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s worth it to tell the adcoms useless information just to have them spend more time looking over your file. If you want to explain certain test scores, it\u2019s best to have your counselors do it. Otherwise, you just look like you\u2019re making excuses. That said, if some schools don\u2019t have a Why Us? essay, it\u2019s not a terrible idea to briefly describe why you would like to attend the university (remember, be specific). As for arts/music supplements, the general consensus is that unless you\u2019re amazing, don\u2019t bother. But that\u2019s not the entire story. Sending one in can show that you\u2019ve confidence in yourself and, what\u2019s more, it couldn\u2019t hurt. At worst, the music department will just put your tape aside without mentioning it. Of course, avoid it if you don\u2019t seriously believe you\u2019ve the talent and don\u2019t send it for the sake of sending one. Also, don\u2019t bother sending the adcoms gift. It\u2019ll come off as trying too hard.\n\nTeacher/counselor LORs: Pick teachers who know you best and pick teachers who can write well. I was going to choose my Calculus teacher, but his writing abilities are\u2026subpar (to put things gently). Really, you\u2019ve very little control over this part of your application, but you can pick teachers who can give telling anecdotes. Also, try to be diverse. No, it\u2019s not absolutely required that you have a math/science rec and a social studies/English rec, but don\u2019t pick teachers who\u2019ll say the same thing about you. As for counselors, if they counselor knows you well, that\u2019s a bonus for you, but they\u2019re really not that important for showing adcoms your personality/your performance in the classroom. Also, as with essays, do NOT be so quick to say your LOR\u2019s are \u201camazing\u201d or \u201cgreat\u201d or \u201cthe best my teacher\u2019s written in his career.\u201d Again, simply not true. Neither you nor your teachers know exactly what the adcoms want. In fact, you shouldn\u2019t even be reading what they say.\n\nDEFERALL/WAITLISTS\nWhile some schools will explicitly say they don\u2019t want any further information, the general consensus is that it\u2019s not a bad idea to send in an additional letter of intent letting the college know that you would still love to attend and that it\u2019s still your top choice. Also, update them on any major new achievements, and, if possible, second interviews aren\u2019t a terrible idea either. Point being, you don\u2019t want them to put you at the bottom of the pile on the wait-list. That said, there\u2019s no point sending in additional letters of recommendations or additional essays, as that might become a bit overwhelming.\n\nThat caps off my overview of college admissions. I\u2019ve tried to word things so as to cause the least amount of controversy, but I know some of you will find some parts of the EC/essays sections objectionable. That said, this is simply what my admissions consultant said and what I\u2019ve learned, so, in the end, I hope it helps some of you out.

The problem really lay with other\u0092s perception of his attitude.  They thought he simply didn\u0092t care about what he was doing, when in reality, he chose to focus his efforts on the actual work, and not in acting enthusiastic during the meeting to discuss what needed to be done.  After discussing this with K***, he realized that other\u0092s perception of his attitude is often almost as important as the actual end product.

Tell me what you guys think and what I can do if I am punished of false accusations.\n\"To the Dean of the School of Natural Sciences,\nMy name is\n\nand this is my official appeal Dr.\n\n's decision to give me an F on the course on the basis of academic dishonesty. On May 15th, 2013, I submitted a scantron for regrade for a midterm that was taken on May 3rd, and handed back on May 10th during a lab. On the day of the exam, I borrowed a calculator from my friend\n\n. I was unaware that the calculator was predisposed to fraction mode so everything that I computed with the calculator came out as a fraction. I started to panic on the test because I did not know what to press to convert the fraction back to decimal form for the chemistry test and I ended up rushing through the entire test with 12-15 minutes to spare. The content of the test consisted of many conceptual questions and a number of mathematical problems that were fairly easy to answer with an appropriate calculator. With the time that I had left, I pressed every function key on the calculator and I finally found the button that converts fractions to decimal form. The button was labeled \"S->D\" which I am still unsure as to what the letters stand for. When I managed to operate the calculator, I looked at the clock and I still had 10 minute to spare so I went over a large portion of my exam. I went through many of the conceptual questions and I was able to correct many of them using the answers that I found on the other problems. An example would be a problem about spontaneous reactions which I initially confused the equation as deltaG = - deltaH + TdeltaS. The actual formula for the equation was deltaG = deltaH - TdeltaS. I was able to clarify this by looking at an equation sheet provided with the exam. Since I knew that a negative delta G accounts for a spontaneous reaction, I knew that the values on one of my mathematical questions were incorrect; given that the reaction for spontaneous, delta H must have been a negative value while delta S was a positive value since the temperature was not high enough to negate the delta H. In doing so, I was able to correct this mathematical question along with a few conceptual questions about spontaneous reactions. In addition, I was able to fix many questions pertaining to pH the calculator gave me actual values so I did not have to guess what the answer would be. Note that the pH questions had logarithmic applications that I would not have been able to estimate in my head without using a calculator. In total, I changed over 12 questions on the exam, granted some of the questions did not require a calculator to answer. When I was down to my last question, I had one minute left on the exam and I guessed the answer that seemed most reasonable and I turned in the exam hastily. Although I did have a lot of trouble with the calculator, I felt really good about the exam because I knew that studying paid off. I discussed my answers with some of my friends that came out of the exam and we all seemed to have consent over many of the problems. A couple days after the exam, the scores were posted and I was really astonished by the fact that I received a 9/25. I began to think that maybe I simply did not understand the material. On the day of lab, I was taking a quiz and my TA placed our exams on the lab tables with the front facing the table so that the scores were hidden. When I finished my exam, packed everything up into my backpack and walked over to my friends' lab station where she was leaving. My friends\n\nand\n\nasked my what happened on my exam and I just told them that there were a lot of pink marks on my scantron and I told them that I though I did well, but I was wrong. They asked me to take out the exam and show them so I handed them my exam to look at. They glanced over the exam and noticed that there was something wrong with my scantron because I answered 26 questions on a 25 question test. I was unaware of this fact until they brought it up and they asked my to take it to Dr.---- so that I can discuss the test because they told me that my score should be around a 17-18/25. Although I wasn't going to ask Dr.\n\nabout it because I though that Dr.\n\nwouldn't give me the points because it was such an avoidable error. However, I decided to send him an email just to ask him about the scantron and he responded 2 days later saying that he would be happy to discuss my \"transcription error\". I took note of the quotations that he placed around the phrase and I wondered if he was skeptical about the error or was it simply procedural to indicate the issue with clarity. 2 days later on May 15th, I brought the exam to him during on of this office hours and he simply made me sign a regrade submission form. I did not get the opportunity to discuss the actual content of the exam with him as he mentioned in his email and the only thing I was able to express to him was the calculator concern. I also pointed out that the error most likely occurred on number 7 or 8 of the exam because it was around the area where I began going over my test after I learned how to use the calculator. I think that the actual error was made when I was fixing my answer for number 7 and I did not erase the initial answer and instead, filled in the actual answer onto number 8. This is the only area where he might think that I altered my scantron after it was passed back because of the answer mismatch. However, I told him in a brief conversation that lasted for 30 seconds that I had to fix a large portion of my scantron. I felt that I was not given the opportunity to fully explain the the situation because he did not have my original test on May 15th for a discussion to take place. I was only offered a form to fill out and that was the entire meeting. Both of my friends in my lab can testify to the fact that there was indeed a transcription error to begin with as they saw my exam almost immediately after it was handed back. In addition, they can voucher the fact that my original score would have been approximately 17 or 18 depending on whether the initial answer for number 7 was counted or the revised answer after I was able to use the calculator. I can honestly say that I did not tamper with the scantron in anyway. As a result of this, Dr.\n\nhas given me an F in the course before I had the chance to reply to the alleged violation and I did not receive any response emails in the past 24 hours. I feel that I should be granted the knowledge of exactly what I did wrong and what indicated any signs of dishonesty. Hopefully he has a photocopy of the scantron that can justify what I am saying because it would be a really helpful document for for my case. Furthermore, there would not have been any significant value of getting the points since I was right in the middle of a B and this class is scaled to the extent in which the B- to B+ range is approximately from 71%-85.99% which means that even if I received a 17 or 18 on this exam, it would raise by grade by a mere 2.5% which would not bring me close to a B+ since I had a 77-78% in the class. I only went in to try to get the points that I deserve and not to cheat to get a better grade. I can honestly say that I would never cheat in school to achieve want. I would hope that you would be able to go over all the material and this statement and consider another outcome. I believe there is an honest mistake and I am open to discuss this in a meeting or via email. I also think that Dr.\n\nshould give me reexamination so that I can prove to him that I studied for the exam and I knew the material well. I was really upset when I saw that he had already changed my grade before telling me the details of my alleged actions. The only thing that I might have done was that I darkened my name on my scantron as the graphite began to smear off in my backpack. Lastly, I would like to say that I am a student with academic integrity and a good academic record. There was a circumstance in Chem 1 in which my lab TA awared more points than I deserved on a quiz and I notified him about the error that he made. Hopefully I can get a better explanation as to what happened with my scantron and if there is anything that requires proof of information such as the transcription error, or the score that I would have received, both my friends\n\nand\n\nare willing to confirm this fact. Thank you very much for reviewing this appeal.\"\n\nAt the end of all this, i was notified earlier today that there in fact was a photocopy of the scantron that indicated clear alterations. However, I insisted that I really do not know what there would be any changes and why would I even tell my professor to submit something that would be incriminating on my part unless I was confident that the photocopy should indicate that there were no changes. Anyway, all the evidence is against me and I don't know what to say. I just know that I didn't do anything to tamper with the scantron at all. And I am a straight A student with no record of academic dishonesty anywhere in my academic history.

I'm taking the ACT this saturday.\nSo yeah basically grade it out of 12. Tell me what I could improve on and what structure I should base my essay on next time I write it..\nThanks a lot!!\n\n\nHere is the prompt:\nTeachers vary in the amount of effort they acknowledge for the work a student does in class. Many students, parents, and teachers argue that students should be highly rewarded for their efforts, because much of what is learned in life is learned during the process of accomplishing a task. Others argue that it is not the effort that should determine students' grades, but students' final scores on a project, assignment, or test because colleges and employers reward results and not effort. In your opinion, should grades be based on effort or actual achievement?\n\n\nEssay:\nEffort is something that many high schoolers are not fond of, especially when it comes to school work. These days kids are getting lazier and lazier each day, as seen by the growing obesity rates. A student's grades he or she recieves should be based  solely on effort. By having a system where grades are based on actual achievement, it intices students to do whatever possible to achieve that grade. To distinguish the best students from the mediocre ones, schools should make grades based on effort.\n\nWithout putting effort into daily things one does, it is hard to be a functional human being. For example, driving a car or taking out the car cannot be accomplished if you don't put effort into it. Have you ever done a math problem and put all the work and still get it wrong? How can someone punish you for actually knowing how to do the problem, but making a calculation error at the very end of the problem? You put effort, yet you don't get the actual achievement.\n\nBy having grades issued for getting the \"right answer\" it makes it easier for students to cheat. Kids can just look to their neighbor during a test and copy whatever correct answer their neighbor has. The person who does this puts no effort in and still manages to get a good grade. This kind of person never learns anything and will not succeed in life. If another student grasps the concept, but gets it wrong on the test, he or she will end up with a lower score than the other student that cheated. This scenario happens all over high schools around the nation.\n\nOn the other hand, opponents say that if grades are based on actual achievement, it gives the brighter students an edge. Colleges and employers can then see which students are the over achievers and will pick them. By making grades based on effort, people won't go the extra mile. They will just put whatever is already stored in their bran from the past. No one will do the extra work so they can get the answer right as well. However, kids will probably be more motivated knowing that they won't have to be perfect and get every question right.\n\nHaving grades based on effort will make everyone's job a little easier. There won't be a burden on students to strive for perfection. In addition, teachers and schools won't have to worry about kids cheating. I will benefit quite a bit if grades are based on effort as will the rest of America.

I need help desperately. Excuse the language and wording, I originally posted it in the life advice section of a brony forum that allows swearing. Anyway...\n\nSo...\n\nIt looks like my years of half-assery, short sightedness, and lack of communication is finally culminating in what will likely derail my life completely. If anyone on here has been wondering why I've been so quiet lately - especially all my Skype friends - this is the reason.\n\nI've ****ed up. ROYALLY ****ed up. All the doors are closing around me, and I'll likely have to give up all my dreams. But I am powerless, all I can do is stand by and watch. In the words of F. Scott Fitzgerald \"The loneliest moment in someone's life is when they are watching their whole world fall apart, and all they can do is stare blankly.\" Thats me. Right now.\n\nBut enough of this melodrama. You're probably here to hear about my problem, right? Well, sit back.\n\nI'm 20, a sophomore in college (I took a year off after high school...why I will explain in a few moments). Ever since I was in like 6th grade, I knew I wanted to be a pilot. I counted on it. I was strong willed. It was the only thing I ever wanted to do. In hindsight, that was stupid on my part, to put all my eggs in one basket, but I was a stupid ****ing kid, what was I supposed to know?\n\nSo there we go, **** up #1) Putting all my eggs in one basket.\n\nMoving onto high school...\n\nHigh school is when our most important developmental years are. But I...well, I pretty much wasted them. But again, with my shortsightedness, I didn't know I was ACTUALLY wasting my time. I wasn't social, I didn't do extracurriculars - other than two years of rocketry club, but I quite because the teacher handling it became too angry to deal with (her anger issues eventually got her fired, actually) - and I didn't do any sports. I didn't realize just how many growth opportunities, and even more important, scholarship opportunities, I was missing. I did the bare minimum to get a good GPA, and that was it. I thought that was all that mattered, because...well, I knew already what I wanted to do with my life, so all I had to do was just scurry through 4 years of HS and head to flight school. I saw high school as less of an opportunity and more of a state-sactioned ritual, nothing more.\n\nOddly though, when junior/senior year came, I didn't even bother with the college search process, even though one would think that with what I just said, I would be jumping at the chance to finally go to college and fly, right? Well, I didn't. My family was going through some financial trouble (I'll elaborate below), so I just kinda...didn't do it. I didn't think about scholarships or financial aid, I just rationalized that it would be best to just take a year off and wait for us to get on a more settled footing.\n\nAnd for future reference, that's generally how I (and pretty much my entire family...probably where I learned it from) handle problems. This image pretty much describes the problem-solving strategy of my family...\n\n[Meme picture from Shawn of the Dead with the saying \"Stay inside. Grab a pint. And wait for all of this to blow over.\"]\n\n\nI'm prone to adjustment disorder, meaning I don't handle unexpected change well, and I tend to seize up and just stand by frozen when unexpected things pop up. It's always kinda worked. Well...until now. Because only I can solve this problem.\n\nANYWAY...\n\nWell, you might be tempted to ask me, \"Well, a lot of people in financial trouble make school work, why didn't you look for financial aid, scholarships, etc?\" Well, on top of my shortsightedness and adjustment disorder issues, I also think I have dysthymia, or long-term, low-grade depression. I was simply too depressed to look. It became a vicious cycle. My adjustment disorder fed my depression, which made the situation worse as time passed, which made the adjustment disorder worse, etc.\n\nBut I didn't actually feel anything was wrong, so I kept doing nothing. That's the funny thing about dysthymia, you don't actually realize you're doing something wrong WHILE you're doing something wrong. It saps you of emotion. I didn't feel a sense of urgency as everyone around me started wearing college gear, I didn't feel bad when I never talked to the guidance counselor, and I didn't feel shame when honors day came and I was the only person who didn't get announced. Hell, I slept through the ceremony.\n\nMy parents didn't push me either. Why? I don't know. Aren't parents supposed to help? I think I convinced them to let me take a year off somehow. How? I don't know. I think they're who I inherited my short sightedness from. Though sometimes I think it's more than just shortsightedness and is an actual Executive Function Disorder. They have a history of excess spending, making snap decisions (like impulse buying a CAR for ****s sake!!), and even my dad quitting his job to start his own company (which, in the span of a decade, resulted in the loss of my college fund, $50,000+ in credit card debt, and a foreclosure). I think I inherited it - The adjustment disorder from mom (when I ask her now what I should do, she just kinda blankly says \"I don't know\" and tries to avoid the subject), and the executive function disorder from dad.\n\nAnyway, enough of that.\n\n****up #2) Wasting my high school experience.\n\nMy gap year could be summed up in two words: Xbox 360. I pretty much spent a year of my life at home playing video games, too depressed to do anything else. Most people use their gap years to study independently, or get a job, or travel. I spent it playing Black Ops.\n\nAnyway, fast forward past that shameful year and lets get to where I am now: university. I got into a university that had a flight program, thanks to some generous financial aid, a few state and school scholarships, and some help from my parents. However, this is where my eggshell house that is my life began to show cracks. The flight program is extra money beyond basic tuition, money we didn't have. But I took the advice of my parents and just put off the flying portion of my education for a semester, which I did. In second semester I got some flight experience, but I was severely behind the curve compared to the rest of the class.\n\nNow that I'm in my third semester, and I'm in the same position as first semester last year, I'm once again grounded, and the cold touch of adjustment disorder is slowly creeping back in. If I don't get my pilots license by next semester, I am automatically kicked out of the program, and it looks like I won't indeed make that deadline.\n\nSo remember that basked full of eggs I mentioned before? Yeah, it just got run over by a semi. And I have no plan B. My singular dream of earning my wings just went up in smoke. I have nothing else in the world that I want to do, I never used my high school career to explore alternatives. I'm back to square one. I'm literally swinging between art, engineering, and law right now, and everything in between. It would be ok if I was just some undecided high school junior, but I'm 20 ****ing years old. I have no idea what I'm doing with this life, or if I even have a way to pay for school. I have no extracurricular or sports record to offer to earn them. I've been out of high school for two years, and my grades this semester have been \"meh\" at best (again, all these issues are distracting me from my school work and driving me into depression).\n\nSo...yeah. My dreams just got shattered. If I were a pony, it would be as if my cutie mark just got burned off my ass. I'm a blank flank again. A 20 year old blank flank. With no idea where to go from here, and a family that is just as clueless, while probably battling 1) dysthymia 2) adjustment disorder and 3) executive function disorder).\n\nWhat do I do?

Not because I'm particularly special, but because I think my story is somewhat unique.  Well, first of all, let me start off by saying that I've taken the SAT a grand total of 6 times (including once in the 7th and 8th grade).  My first score in 7th grade was a 990, with a 470 math and a 520 verbal.  My second score in 8th grade was an 1110, with a 490 math and a 620 verbal.  The gap between my math and verbal in eighth was probably odd since I'd taken algebra in 8th grade, but to be honest, I disliked math and learned virtually nothing.  My math score improved only very minorily obviously.\n\nIn 10th grade I took the PSAT's, scoring a 1250 with a 700 verbal and a 550 math.  By this point my math and verbal gap was becoming rather extreme.  Especially since I'd taken algebra I again in 9th grade, and was a few months through geometry.  Later, in June I took the actual SAT's to see if a full year of geometry had substantially improved my progress.  Apparently it hadn't as I score a 1250 again.  In 11th grade, I was determined to prove that I was capable of getting the scores I hoped for on the SAT's (1500+) so I spent about 30 hours over a month time period, studying for the PSAT's.  I improved substantially, scoring a 1470, with a 780 verbal and a 690 math (I also managed a 770 writing).  After this score, I was much more confident in my abilities.  Too confident.  When I took the SAT's in January of Junior year, I went into them completely cold, expecting that I'd score somewhere in the 1500's naturally.  Instead, I scored a 770 verbal and a 650 math; respectable scores by any measure, but I knew I was capable of more.\n\nI convinced myself that I had merely been overly nervous.  So when I took the SAT again in April (or May, not too sure), I went in cold again, determined to be less nervous.  It failed horribly and I received a 1370: 710 verbal (I panicked and second guessed myself because I was so intent on an 800), 660 math.  This was the third time I had taken it, and all logic said I should  \"quit while I was ahead\".  Fortunately, I've ever been stubborn.  This time, I resolved that I was going to be prepared for the test.  But rather then use the common prep-books, I created my own unique study plan.  In order to improve my math, I played chess, which has been shown to improve math ability significantly, fairly often during the summer.  I also read many math theory books such as \"Imagining numbers\" and \"e:the story of a number\".  To be honest, I was just looking for a way to improve my math ability in general and wasn't using these methods solely to improve my SAT scores.  But I believe they none-the-less helped me immensely.  For verbal, I just did what I'd always done: I read.  Books like 1984, A Brave New World, and Plato's Republic.\n\nFor all this effort though, I wasn't even sure I'd wind up taking the test again.  In fact I missed both the regular and late registrations for the Oct SAT because of my indecision.  But, I decided I had to at least see if my unorthodox methods had made any difference.  So I sat down about 8 days before the test, and took a practice test.  I was stunned by the results.  1570.  800 verbal, 770 math.  Thinking it was just a fluke, I took another practice test the next day.  1590.  800 verbal, 790 math.  At that point I realized what had happened.  Firstly, I had finally realized exactly what it was the SAT math tested.  Contrary to what I'd previously thought, I realized that it didn't test math.  It tested reasoning and it tested carefullness.  Partly because of chess, my reasoning skill was much improved, and I was much less impulsive when choosing answers.  I understood the logical path from A, the question, to B, the answer, with much more clarity.  I also came to realize something that I should have been obvious to me from the start:  you shouldn't try to solve math problems on the SAT.  In fact, that is one of the worst things you can do because it takes up time and is totally unnecessary.\n\nOne of the most amazing revelations I ever came to was realizing that collegeboard gave you the answers to virtually every question.  They sit directly beneath every question, numbered A, B, C, D, or E.  All you have to do is determine which one is correct.  And the best way to do this is to take the easiest path.  Actually solving the question using algebra is almost never the easiest path.  I can honestly say, that on more than 80% of the math questions on the Oct SAT, I used various methods of plugging in numbers to receive the answer in about half the time it would have taken me to solve in algebraically (actually, much less then half the time because I really possess very little if any algebraic skills.  I couldn't have solved many of the problems even if I tried).\n\nDo not solve the problem unless it's absolutely necessary.  There is always an easier method if you can just find it (which, admittedly, can take some getting used to).  Anyway, to make an already long story, slightly less long, I'll conclude.  I received a 1570 on the Oct SAT.  800 Math and 770 verbal (this was vaguely annoying as I'd been getting all 800's on practice tests).  The moral of the story?  Don't let the SAT beat you.  Figure out exactly what it's testing, and it'll start to seem like a walk in the park.  And always remember, be extraordinarily careful on math.  Make sure you consistently underline the given info and what the question is asking (the only math question i got wrong in Oct I missed because I used diameter as a radius: old habits die hard).  And remember, if I can go from a 550 Math in 10th grade to an 800 only two years later, anyone can achieve their goals.

Then write the essay as directed.\n\n\"The ends always justify the means.\"\nAssignment: Choose one example from personal experience, current events, or history, literature, or any other discipline and use this example to write an essay in which you agree or disagree with the statement above. Your essay should be specific.\n\n\n\nThe results of an event or series of events is often inconsequential compared to the actual process that produced those results. This is contrary to the view that \u0093the ends always justify the means.\u0094  An example of how this view is incorrect is easily seen in Adolf Hitler\u0092s reign in Germany during the twentieth century.  Although the despot pulled his country out of depression and made it a world power, he killed many innocent Jews along the way and devastated the people of his own and other countries alike.\n\nDuring the early 1900s, Germany, like much of the rest of the world, was going through a depression.  In fact, the depression hit Germany so hard that the German mark, the nation\u0092s currency, was worth thousands times less than it is currently.  Hitler, as a political leader during this time and eventual chancellor and dictator of Germany, pulled the country out of depression, and, through economic savvy and military conquest, made Germany a world power by the early 1940s. Clearly, the fruits of Hitler\u0092s reign were sweet indeed, but the means by which the tyrant achieved these results were dispicable.\n\nIn pulling the country out of depression and starting the Third Reich, Hitler harmed many people of the world and committed many crimes against humanity. As many know, Hitler led the Holocaust, a period of time in which Hitler killed millions of Jews simply because he believed they were a detriment to the world. Furthermore, countries such as Poland and even Hitler\u0092s native Austria were devastated by his military attacks that caused them to submit to German supremacy.\n\nFew would agree to the fact that Hitler\u0092s means of killing millions of innocent civilians and trampling other countries are justifiable by Hitler\u0092s removing of Germany from depression and placing it among the world\u0092s most prosperous countries. Here, we see that although the ends are good and pure, the means can hardly be thought of as such.  Clearly, then, as is demonstrated by Adolf Hitler\u0092s reign in Germany, the ends do not always justify the means.

But the rapid pace of technological innovation and the split second processing capabilities of computers that can work virtually nonstop have made all of us feel rush ed. We have adaopted the relentless pace of the very machines that were supposed to simplify our lives, with the result that, wh ether at work or play, people do not feel like their lives have changed for the better.\n\n-Adapted from Karen Finucan, \"Life in the Fast Lane\"\n\nDo changes that make our lives easier not necessarily make them better?\"\n\n\n\nMy response\n\n\nAlthough technological changes have had many great effects on our lives and our world, the modern age of super technology has had more negative effects than benefits on our quality of life.\n\nPerhaps the most clear-cut example of the cons of techology is the effects it has had on the health of average people. The \"miracles\" that technology create ultimately let many people get away with little to no physical activity. The United States, arguably the most technologically advanced nation in the world, has the highest rate of obesity, the most heart problems, and the largest amount of cancer per capita of any country in the whole world. Computer and TV screens have been shown to damage the retnas of people's eyes. Radiation from microwaves and from cell phones have been shown to cause cancer. Our ability to use technology to keep people alive longer is irrelevant -- we allow it to destroy our quality of life and our health and then let it keep us from death so we can continue to live in misery.\n\nThe next problem is hte \"nonstop\" pace that Finucan claims is a result of technology. When we are too busy to enjoy our long lives and our sucess, it begs the question whether or not sucess and longer life are actually that important. Technlogy is creating more \"workaholics\" who make more money and get lots done, but they are unable to enjoy their sucess because they are too busy racing towards achieving more. People in times past worked hard too, but their culture allowed them to enjoy it by doing things such as spending time with their families. This nonstop pace makes very few people genuinely happy.\n\nFinally, although we have made technological advances in communications, the proliferation of computers truly spurs isolationism. Busnessmen can go to work and spend the whole day in an office on a computer. Children's games have shifted from board games and outdoor games to a heavy focus on computer and video games. Students can do all their schoolwork alone in a room with a computer. One can order pizzas on the internet. Computers have become many people's new best friends, an escape for other people, and a detriment to all.\n\nAlthough nobody in their right mind would denythe benefits of technology, we've taken it a step too far and at a rate too quickly. People should take a serious look at the effects technology has had on their lives.\n\n\nPunctuation/grammatical errors are my fault, but if I made any spelling errors or puncutation errors, those were probably a result of typing too quickly.\n\nAnyways, hopefully someone will be kind enough to tell me what they think (well, hopefully two people, or even more).\n\nTHANK YOU.\n\nok i'm going to finish my test now, bye.

Thus, use Physics GRE results for each school, Math GRE results for each school.This would seem to measure actual learning in their majors!\n\nAdmittedly there are several drawbacks to this. One drawback that I can think of offhand would be that not every major has a GRE such as accounting, visual arts, and business management, engineerig etc., although CPA passing rates can be used in accounting.\n\nSecondly, this might encourage schools to focus on what the GRE tests and not on the education, which is always a fundamental problem. However, I do think that this would be a better measure than what US News is doing.\n\nAnother alternative is to have faculty members rate schools based on what they know of their major!

The woman is black, most of the team members are white and law-enforcement officials say they are investigating allegations that racial epithets were shouted at the woman.\n\nResidents, students and faculty members have staged at least five protests in the last four days, including one Tuesday night outside the building where Duke's president, Richard H. Brodhead, was holding a news conference. They are upset with the silence of team members and the university's handling of the case.\n\nMr. Brodhead's announcement that the team's season was being suspended came five days after 46 of 47 members of the Blue Devils lacrosse team provided DNA samples to Durham police investigators. The team's roster includes 26 players from New York, New Jersey and Connecticut high schools. Mr. Brodhead said that he met with the team's captains Tuesday morning and that they apologized for the embarrassment they had caused themselves, their families, the athletic department and the university. They also denied the allegations made by the woman, who said she had been assaulted in a bathroom by three team members.\n\nMichael B. Nifong, the Durham County district attorney, criticized team members for not coming forward.\n\n\"The thing that most of us found so abhorrent, and the reason I decided to take it over myself, was the combination gang-like rape activity accompanied by the racial slurs and general racial hostility,\" Mr. Nifong said Tuesday in a telephone interview.\n\n\"There are three people who went into the bathroom with the young lady, and whether the other people there knew what was going on at the time, they do now and have not come forward. I'm disappointed that no one has been enough of a man to come forward. And if they would have spoken up at the time, this may never have happened.\"\n\nOfficials are investigating the incident as first-degree forcible rape, common law robbery, first-degree kidnapping, first-degree sexual offense and felonious strangulation. Mr. Nifong said it was unlikely the investigation would be completed in time in time for Duke to resume its season; the team's last scheduled game is May 7.\n\nA statement attributed to the team's captains \u0097 Matt Zash, David Evans, Dan Flannery and Bret Thompson \u0097 said the team had cooperated with the police. \"We have provided authorities with DNA samples,\" it said. \"The understanding is that the results of the DNA testing will be available sometime next week. The DNA results will demonstrate that these allegations are absolutely false.\"\n\nSince the March 13 incident became public, the authorities have said members of the team have not cooperated, and protests have arisen in this college town of 210,000 residents because of the alleged violent nature of the attack and its possible racial elements. The News and Observer of Raleigh, N.C., reported that the woman was a mother of two and a student at North Carolina Central University, also in Durham. She was hired with another female dancer to perform at the party.\n\nThe Duke lacrosse team has benefited from the sport's surge in popularity in recent years. The team has been ranked as high as No. 2 in the nation this season and lost in the N.C.A.A. championship game to Johns Hopkins last spring. The Blue Devils were expected to contend for another title this season.\n\nJoe Alleva, the Duke athletic director, had decided to forfeit the team's games on Saturday and Tuesday night as a penalty for the party.\n\nThe woman told the police that she and another woman went to the house expecting to dance for 5 men at a bachelor party and instead found more than 40, according to The News and Observer. Public records list the house as the residence of Mr. Zash and Mr. Flannery.\n\nShe said that almost immediately upon performing, the men started taunting them with racial epithets. The women left shortly thereafter, according to a report of the incident in a search warrant that was granted on March 16. But they were persuaded to return after one of the men apologized.\n\nAccording to the application for the search warrant, two men pulled the woman into a bathroom after she returned to the house. \"Someone closed the door to the bathroom where she was and said, 'Sweetheart you can't leave,' \" the report said.\n\nJason Bissey, a chef who lives near the house, said he saw the woman that night from his porch and told the police that he heard men harassing the women.\n\nThe police did not take a DNA sample from the only African-American player on the team because the woman said the three assailants were white, the police said.\n\nAmong 30 items seized by the police, according to Mr. Nifong and the search warrant, were five acrylic fingernails, cellphones and $160 in $20 bills that the woman said had been stolen from her.\n\nSome of the players and Robert C. Ekstrand, a lawyer who is representing many of them, did not return telephone calls Tuesday.\n\nJohn Danowski, the father of a star player for Duke, Matt Danowski, and a longtime coach of Hofstra's lacrosse team, would not comment on particulars of the incident and refused to say if his son was at the party.\n\nThe incident has cast an unflattering light on a university that has a track record for success and integrity in athletics rivaled only by its highly regarded academics.\n\nIn his statement, Mr. Brodhead addressed the turmoil the allegations brought to the Duke community, but balanced it with a reminder that no one had been charged.\n\n\"While we await the results of the investigation, I remind everyone that under our system of law, people are presumed innocent until proven guilty,\" Mr. Brodhead said in his statement. \"One deep value the university is committed to is protecting us all from coercion and assault. An equally central value is that we must not judge each other on the basis of opinion or strong feeling rather than evidence of actual conduct.\"\n\nDuke officials said they allowed the team members to vacate the house, and on Tuesday, signs reading \"Where Are They\" and \"Outraged Duke Alum,\" littered its yard.\n\n\"How can I be surprised at the outrage?\" Mr. Brodhead said. \"If the things alleged are verified, they're outrageous.\"                "}, {"date": "2006-07-28T10:52:54+00:00", "url": "http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/sat-preparation/219097-college-board-test-any-thoughts.html", "messages": "\n                    Does anyone feel that the blue book test #7 is a lot easier than any of the other tests in the book?

I am an Italian student and I am going to apply to Princeton in the next weeks. I am writing my statement of purposes and it it not that clear to me the \"correct\" way admission commissions expect me to do it.\nIf someone had time to give a look and criticize I'd really appreciate.\nThis is the statement:\n\nI have studied engineering in Italy, France, and United States, and have made the thoughtful decision to pursue my graduate studies in the last one.\n\nI studied Aerospace engineering in Rome for seven years, two of which abroad. I enjoyed the subjects but good scores partially indicate suitability to research. I wanted to test my skills and add a personal mark to my education thus I participated to an European students exchange program. I spent one in year in France at Supaero*, because of its close relationship with the most important European aerospace industries and research institutions. I experienced a rich period meeting people from all international backgrounds and immersing myself in the culture. I acquired an interest in humanity, which I admit to have lacked before, and I gained the social maturity I was searching by throwing myself in a new environment. By learning French, I can proudly say that I will always be an avid promoter of communication in the languages overwhelmed European Union.\nAchieving much worked for results I was given the opportunity to spend five months working in ONERA, (\u0093Office National d\u0092Etudes et de Recherches A\u00e9rospatiales\u0094), modeling VonKarman vortex shedding (please see the r\u00e9sum\u00e9 for details). I was absorbed and discovered my passion for hands on research. The way I dealt with my obligations, which reflects the personality I acquired through musical practice, were highly appreciated by my advisor, Mme xxxxx1. Starting from middle school, music gave fundamental contributions to my personality. I learnt efficient scheduling, allotting at least two daily hours for practice, my engineering studies still being very heavy. My devotion to work, endurance to long term pressure, and the will to be the first teacher of myself by a constructive auto-criticism were skills I forcely had to develop to achieve results in this tough discipline.\n\nWith my final goal of completing my studies in United States, I was accepted by Prof. xxxx2 as a research assistant in the Turbulent Combustion Laboratory of Pennsylvania State University, on the behalf of Professor xxxx3's recommendation. The purpose of my research, which I will present in Rome as my undergraduate thesis, centers on the original design and construction of a variable length combustor, the analysis of its unstable behavior with special attention to the influence of fuel composition and the validation of a time-lag model predicting instabilities. I was able to gain valuable research experience and use a wide range of experimental equipment completing my most numerical and theoretical education.\nWhile writing this letter I am finishing my thesis, and am still enjoying the incredible opportunities available to me here. I especially liked the philosophy, \u0093this is your lab and your goals, now build your thesis,\u0094 which gave me a high responsibility and the satisfaction of being trusted to pursue individual research without constant guidance. Being initially embarrassed to ask questions, I soon overcame this brief hindrance and developed an understanding of how team work in the laboratory is encouraged. My active, positive attitude is appreciated and considered stimulating for the laboratory atmosphere: even the most experienced people can be forced to reflect on a  puzzling question posed by a student. This learning process, consisting of being provided only hints rather than a detailed how-to guide, left me at struggling for solutions still helping me to take the rigth direction and save time. I found the focused, high-density learning experience I had been looking for.\nAlthough I tested and then confirmed my desire to pursue scientific research, I also felt a sense of incompleteness. When I identified the right model in ONERA and obtained a first stabilization of the shedding, I had to leave and further advancements were obtained in my absence. Similarly, I must leave PennState for Rome and other students will explore the new directions my current results suggest. It is time for a long-term endeavour and a PhD matches my will.\n\nI want to focus on researches related to the design of a hypersonic vehicle. Princeton offers me two possibilities, both interesting me in the same way. The first is to work in the combustion group, because of its research in supersonic combustion. I especially aim to work with Professor xxxx4 on plasma enhanced counter flow flame as it attempts to understand the fundamentals of plasma flame interaction. Its controlled conditions and configuration deal with a convenient number of phenomena and allows numerical simulations for comparison and more insight view (on the opposite, combustion instabilities are extremely sensible to boundary conditions thus, experiments are intrinsically less controllable and numerical simulations are difficult to calibrate). Still, the possibility to add complexity step by step, for example considering turbulent counter flows, will eventually produce a coherent series of experiments to which I would like to contribute as a PhD student. Otherwise, I would like to focus my research on flow-electromagnetic field interactions, especially applied to turbulence active control, reentry overheating or drag reduction. These techonologies are actually unexploited but they could have a massive impact on space transportation.\n\nDuring my graduate studies, I plan to extend my knowledge in combustion and fluid dynamic, and prepare myself to pursue research in an academic or research institution. The department of mechanical and aerospace engineering at Princeton, which conducted research sponsored by NASA in relation to the X43 program and hosts an interdisciplinary group devoted to high-speed vehicle design, will provide me with important future job connections and with the education matching my desires. I hope to be able to become a part of your community, sharing amity with motivated people and contributing with my enthusiasm, skills and determination.\n\n\n* One of the \"Grands Ecoles Francai\u00e7es d'Ingegn\u00e9rie\"\n\n\n\nTotal words: 934\n\nQuestions:\n\n1)Is it too long?\n2) should I be so specific about the experiment I want to participate to?\n3) should I even suggest how I would like to \"change\" it and make a comparison with things I found frustrating in my previous research about combustion instabilities?\n\nI a pretty sure the statement requires deep grammar review and I am waiting for my girl friend to help me... I am  more interested in your opinion about the content.\n\n\nThank you very much!\nLorenzo                "}, {"date": "2006-11-06T21:09:20+00:00", "url": "http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/sat-subject-tests-preparation/258506-whats-up-with-this.html", "messages": "\n                    So about a week before taking the November 2nd  SAT II exams, I added some score recipients for the test.

Historical analysis coupled with that of current societal trends bear witness to this fact.\n\nDuring the 18th and 19th centuries Great Britain drastically increased its commitment to technology.  The development of such inventions as the cotton gin and the power loom, together with the widespread use of factories and division of labor, resulted in a far more modernistic, technologically-oriented society than that which had existed prior to the Industrial Revolution.  Yet as the working class came to acquire wealth, it also began to make demands for political reform conducive to its success \u2013 among them voting rights, education, and labor laws.  These reforms clearly reflect values other than that of technological progress \u2013 the suffrage laws reflect democracy, labor laws reflect quality of life, and education reflects a fusion of the previous two values.  The fact that those reforms existed in such a technologically-oriented society indicates that a commitment to progress does not necessarily result in the neglect of other sorts of progress.\n\nToday America is undergoing a similar increase in technological commitment.  With the advent of computers, iPods, and nuclear weapons, America can be said to be more committed to technology than ever before.  Yet this, as in Britain, has not led us to neglect other values.  The 1973 Clean Air Act demonstrates our level of commitment to the environment, and No Child Left Behind to education.  Often it is because of technology that our society has begun to lean towards other values.  Many civil liberties groups have expressed fears that the government may be using technology to encroach on our First Amendment rights, and environmentalist groups worry that products of technological progress may be polluting the environment.  In this way technological commitment has not only not led our society to neglect other values, but has actually led it to pursue them further.\n\nFrom these examples it is evident that a strong commitment to technological progress does not cause society to abandon other values, and may even result in greater concern for them.

For simplicity, I suggest that we just report whether the results were exactly as expected within the University and LAC lists (let's use USNWR rankings for simplicity) or, if the results are not exactly as expected, the number of schools out of the total number of applications that had unexpected outcomes.  For example, if your S or D is accepted at a school that ranks above a school that rejected them you would report both schools as anomalies.  If you know a reason why this may have occurred e.g. legacy or recruited athlete at one school but not the other you can mention it, if you want.  If you know a reason but don't want to mention it you can just say that. But if you know a reason for the reversal of order but aren't willing to mention that there is one, it would be helpful if you simply did not report that event as an anomaly.

But \u0093closed doors,\u0094 either in the form of specific obstacles or a lack of opportunities, often prevent people from reaching their full creative potential.\n\nPrompt: Do closed doors make us creative? Plan and write an essay in which you develop your point of view on this issue. Support your position with reasoning and examples taken from your reading, studies, experience, or observations.\n\nEssay:\n\nSome of the world's most profound and revolutionary creativity have been the result of the closed doors. Closed doors present the human race with difficult situations to which we must at times discover creative solutions.\n\nMany of the greatest advances in science can be attributed as the direct consequence of these so-called \"closed doors\". For example, the lack of simplicity in the geocentric model of the solar system led to the development of the heliocentric model by Copernicus.The closed doors imposed by the geocentric model, resulted in the creation of a model which we still use 400 years after its initial discover.\n\nAlso, the success of many remarkable businessmen where the result of closed doors. In the 1930s, Rockefeller attained the American dream; successfully achieving the elusive goal of going from \"rags to riches\". Rockefeller was born into a poverty-stricken family, and the closed doors imposed by his financial situation. Rockefeller successful developed a very creative (almost too creative), business model which was later called a form of ostensible monopoly. In a similar situation was the now-renown Henry Ford. The closed doors imposed by slow production led Ford to create one of the most important manufacturing breakthroughs: the assembly line. The assembly line is still used in the manufacturing process 80 years later, an astonishing accomplishment given the rapid advancement of manufacturing technology in the past century.\n\nIn addition, romantic poets such as William Blake used the closed doors of the miserable conditions in Victorian-age Britain in order to create poetry that whose meaning was so profound that it shaped the minds of the generations which followed. William Blake was the forerunner in the creation of the Noble Savage which is still used as the creation of romantic poetry today.\n\nThe closed doors imposed on Blake,Copernicus,Rockefeller, and Ford have truly created unfathomable wonders whose creativity so great that they are used as the basis of future development in their respective science. Those who triumph against the closed doors presented before them are truly worthy of being called pioneers.

You'll notice that many of my examples are Christian themed.  My class is given through a Christian school and it's common-knowledge you'll have a boosted grade with such examples.  I wouldn't use them on the SAT essay.\n\nPlease ignore any of my (dreadful!!!) grammar/spelling/punctuation errors.  I didn't have time to check it then, and I certainly am not going to edit this to post it on here. ;)\n\nESSAY 1 -\n\nWinston Churchill remains known as one of the greatest leaders in the history of the world, and in particular, the 20th century.  Best known as the prime minister of the United Kingdom during the Second World War, he steadfastly encouraged his public while he remaining courageous and brave throughout the scariest of times.  Throughout his life he used his fabulous vocabulary and wit, and produced many fabulous quotable lines.  Some of these quotes held humor, often they encouraged, and often they spoke truths.  One such Churchill quote says that \u0093The price of greatness is responsibility.\u0094  This begs to ask the question:  do we expect too much from our leaders and other public figures?  And what sort of responsibility do they have to us as their followers?\nLately, many newspaper articles have discussed at a great length a man named Ted Haggard.  Haggard started the New Life Church in Colorado years ago in his home\u0092s basement, and has remained the pastor as it has grown to become a mega-church housing thousands.  This man, once a great leader well renowned by the evangelical community, has fallen to disgrace after a scandal involving methamphetamine and a homosexual prostitute.  Not only does this unfortunate situation sit terribly with me on a moral standpoint\u0097it saddens me anytime someone sins against the Lord\u0097but it finds itself terribly disturbing simply because of this mans position.  As a pastor, he had apparently devoted his life to serving the Lord and preaching His ways.  By going against what Scripture so blatantly teaches, he has shown irresponsibility to not only his congregation, but to God.  He has let down thousands of people who once trusted him as a godly man, a man they could put on a pedestal, without ever letting them down.\nI think back upon American presidents who hold much responsibility for the people of the country.  These men are voted on to not just lead the country, but to show the model prototype of the fine American citizen to those in foreign lands.  Back in 1992, Bill Clinton got voted into office by the American people.  Though people often debate the quality of his leadership during his presidency, rarely does one situation hold many differing opinions.  Clinton became known for his involvement in a scandal widely referred to as \u0093The Lewinsky Scandal.\u0094  While the specifics of this terrible scandal are unnecessary, he lied during his testimony before the grand jury.  In doing so, he broke the law.  This leader, given the responsibility to uphold the law in all he did, instead broke it, embarrassing the public in the process.\nFinally, I think of one more example of a time in which a public figure has let his public down.  Mel Gibson, the Academy Award winning actor, director, and producer, would become famous for his arrest by Los Angeles County police and later pleated guilty to driving under the influence of alcohol.  Unfortunately, such a violation of the law finds itself not too unusual.  However, Gibson had just produced The Passion of the Christ, a movie chronically the last 24 hours in the life of the Lord Jesus Christ.  Many Christians and Catholics found themselves embarrassed that a man who produced a film so openly for the Lord would do such a thing counter to God\u0092s Word.  He had let his public down, and many rightly held much disdain for him because of it.\nPersonally, I do not believe we expect or can expect too much from our leaders.  Leaders simply must remember that they provide an example to those watching them, and that will disappoint, should their example stray off the straight and narrow.  God speaks about this very thing in His Word.  In Matthew 18:6 he warns of offences by leaders saying, \u0093But whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in Me to sin, it would be better for him if a millstone were hung around his neck, and he were drowned in the depth of the sea.\u0094  People put in positions of leadership have a greater responsibility to those around to their followers, because not only do they lead, but in doing so provide an example to a great audience.\n\nESSAY 2 -\n\n\n\u0093The man who never alters his opinion is like standing water, and breeds reptiles of the mind.\u0094  So stated William Blake, an English poet born in the eighteenth century.  In making this statement, he made it known that he did not consider it poor for someone to change their opinions.  I would have to agree.  Instead of thinking one who often changes his opinions wishy-washy and unreliable, I consider them wise.  Formulating ideas and opinions through experience will often reap well thought-out results as opposed to behaving stubbornly and not having the opportunity to achieve more pleasant results.\n\nOftentimes people form opinions without ever really having a handle on the full scenario.  Consider my father, who like every parent has, issued a hasty punishment to me for a situation he did not know much about.  As the head of the household and my father, he had every right to punish me in such a way, but I felt hurt because I did not believe he had taken the time to fully understand the situation.  My father kindly listened to my concerns, and told me he would reconsider.  Only a few hours later, he approached me and told me that he had not actually viewed the scenario in that way, and now held a fuller understanding of what exactly had happened.  He changed his opinion, and I only received half of the original punishment.  This result gained much respect for me, and not just because I had only a week off the computer.  Rather, my father\u0092s lack of pride impressed me and his willingness to admit his incorrect view of the situation earned my respect.\n\nOccasionally people hold an opinion solely because they think it does good for others.  Washington State\u0092s Board of Education concerns itself with how well their public school students leave high school educated.  They thought that Washington kids often left unprepared for the challenges they would face in the college world.  This caused them to propose a test back in the 1980\u0092s, the Washington Assessment of Student Learning, oftentimes referred to as the WASL.  At first, though some parents protested it citing unreasonable expectations and unusual questions, most teachers considered it a good idea.  Now however, teachers see that in order for their classes to get high marks on the WASL, they must spend all their time learning concepts at a quick pace.  Because it does not allow for deep time spent in specific subjects, teachers honestly can now say that this hinders their teaching capabilities.  What started to \u0093ensure success of all students\u0094 now finds itself an idea that may soon get tossed.  Reevaluating an opinion after discovering what it really entails can do more good than harm.\n\nEven the Bible shows that God, the all-knowing and always perfect Father, has changed His opinion.  In Exodus 32:14, we see \u0093so the Lord changed His mind about the harm which He said He would do to His people.\u0094  While Moses delayed and spent more time than expected in the mountains with God, the Israelites grew impatient and asked Aaron to make them a god who would go before them.  Aaron obliged, and collected jewelry from all the Israelites.  He fashioned a molten calf and said, \u0093This is your god, O Israel, who brought you up from the land of Egypt.\u0094  God\u0092s initial reaction to the Israelites\u0092 transgression showed his swift and rightful anger, as he said \u0093now then let Me alone, that My anger may burn against them, and that I may destroy them.\u0094  Only five verses later we see the Lord changing his mind.  If our holiest of holy God can change his mind, than certainly can we feel such a freedom.\n\nAs one can see in the examples of my father, the teachers formerly advocating the WASL, and in our God, one should not look down upon someone who changes their position.  Instead of signifying a wishy-washy and thus unreliable mind, it shows one who instead of acting stubborn and prideful wisely considers other ways. It shows an ability to see through a situation and properly note what works and what does not.  William Blake hit it right on the head when he said that to never change one\u0092s opinion \u0093is like standing water.\u0094  Only breeding bad scenarios, habits, or other unfortunate circumstances, it shows one\u0092s prideful unwillingness to change his first thought.

Talking out loud will help keep you focused. Ready to get familiar?\nScrew-Up 1: Pronouns\nPronoun errors are the most common type of screw-up found on Identifying Sentence Errors questions. Pronouns are words that take the place of nouns (words for people, places, and things)\u0097words like she, her, hers, he, him, his, they, their, it, its, that, and which. Let\u0092s look at this sentence:\n\nErnie felt better after playing air guitar.\n\n\nA pronoun is a word you would use to replace the noun Ernie:\n\nHe felt better after playing air guitar.\n\n\n\u0093Hearing\u0094 pronoun problems might take a little practice, because people often use pronouns incorrectly in casual speech. So even if a particular pronoun sounds correct, double-check it to make sure it follows all the rules governing pronoun use. Here are those rules:\nPronoun Agreement\nPronoun agreement is by far the most frequently tested pronoun rule in Identifying Sentence Errors questions. Here\u0092s what it\u0092s all about.\nPronouns must agree in number with the noun. If the noun is plural, the pronoun must be plural; if the noun is singular, the pronoun must be singular. This sounds straightforward enough, but spotting errors in pronoun agreement on the test can be tricky because we make errors of pronoun agreement so frequently in speech. We tend to say things like \u0093Yo, somebody lost their shoe!\u0094 instead of \u0093Yo, somebody lost his shoe!\u0094 You might avoid saying somebody lost his shoe because you don\u0092t want to exclude women by saying his, and it\u0092s cumbersome to write somebody lost his or her shoe. People attempt to solve these problems with the gender-neutral their. So if you see it on the test, you\u0092ll know it\u0092s an error. Their might be gender-neutral, but it\u0092s plural, and plural pronouns cannot ever replace singular nouns.\nSince this error is so common in everyday speech and therefore sounds correct to many people\u0092s ears, you can be sure you\u0092ll see a few questions on it on the test. The deceptively correct sound of many pronoun agreement errors serves as a good reminder of how dangerous it is to just trust your ear. Often what sounds right is dead wrong.\nThe sentence below is incorrect because the pronoun and the noun don\u0092t agree in number:\n\nEvery student   at the party  tried   to look    their    best  .   No error  .\nA   B   C   D   E\n\n\n\n\n\nThis sentence begins with the singular noun student, so the pronoun must be singular too. Their is plural and therefore wrong in this sentence.\nThe pronoun and noun also won\u0092t agree if the noun is plural and the pronoun is singular:\n\nEven though  some possess the flexibility to put their legs\nA\nover their heads, most people   vary  in   his or her  ability\nB   C\nto achieve   this feat  .   No error  .\nD   E\n\n\n\nIn this sentence, the problem is with C, the phrase his or her. Those pronouns refer to the plural noun people, but his or her is singular, because that pesky or makes it one or the other. This is a case in which their is correct, and his or her is incorrect.\nAnother kind of pronoun agreement question just tests to see if you\u0092re paying attention. On questions like the one below, you\u0092ll get into trouble if you\u0092re reading quickly and fail to make sure that the pronoun matches up with the noun it replaces:\n\nFor  the robber trying to decide between potential getaway\nA\ncars, every car   up for  consideration has   their    own  set of\nB   C   D\nadvantages.   No error\nE\n\n\n\nIn this sentence, the pronoun their replaces the noun car. This is incorrect, because car is singular, and their is plural. If you were reading carelessly, however, you might assume that since the first part of the sentence contains the plural noun cars, the plural pronoun their is correct. Always be sure you\u0092re inspecting each pronoun carefully.\nPronoun Case\nWe\u0092re about to get on your case. The \u0093case\u0094 of a word refers to the function that a word performs in a sentence. The most important thing for you to understand in reference to pronoun case is the subjective and objective case. \u0093Huh?\u0094 Exactly. Let us explain.\nA word is the subject of a sentence if it is the main noun that performs the verb. The object of a sentence is the noun toward which, or upon which, the verb is being directed. Look at this sentence:\n\nSam kissed Jess.\n\n\nSam is the subject, since he performed the kiss, and Jess is the object, since she received the kiss.\nWhen a pronoun replaces a noun, that pronoun must match the noun\u0092s case. This is important because pronouns actually have different forms, depending on their cases.\nSubjective Case Pronouns Objective Case Pronouns\nI me\nyou you\nhe, she, it him, her, it\nwe us\nthey them\nwho whom\n\nIn the example sentence, you would replace the subject, Sam, with the subject pronoun, he, and the object, Jess, with the object pronoun, her. He kissed her.\nThe SAT Writing section often tests your knowledge of pronoun case in a tricky way. You\u0092ll get phrases like her and her cats or him and his friends. They try to confuse you with these phrases by including two pronouns, each of which is doing separate things. They want you to reason that if one pronoun is in a certain case, then the other pronoun should be in the same case, right? Noooo. For example:\n\nHer  and   her friend  like to stay in their hotel room and\nA   B\ndrink root beer  whenever   they take a trip  .   No error  .\nC   D   E\n\n\n\nThis sample has a plural subject: Her and her friend. You know her and her friend is the subject since they are the ones who do the liking in the sentence\u0097they perform the verb (drink). In this sentence, the first her is a pronoun and should be in the subjective case, not the objective case.\nDon\u0092t worry if this all feels too technical for you. If you can grasp this kind of grammatical complexity after a few tries, then you\u0092re in great shape. But whether you know the grammar or not, there is a strategy that can help you decide if a pronoun is in the proper case. When you have a compound subject like her and her friend, throw out each side of the phrase and try it out in the sentence\u0097just remember to make the verb singular, since it stops being plural when you throw out one half of the subject. If you follow this method, you\u0092ll get two sentences, which would begin in the following ways:\n\nHer likes to stay . . .\n\nHer friend likes to stay . . .\n\n\nYou should immediately be able to hear that the first sentence is wrong and the second one is right. Suddenly it seems obvious that the first part of the original sentence should read:\n\nShe and her friend like to stay . . .\n\n\nThe Curious \u0093Cases\u0094 of Me and I\nThe SAT particularly likes to test you on phrases such as John and me or the ghost in the graveyard and I, because many people don\u0092t know when to use me and when to use I.\nHere\u0092s a quick True/False question for you: It\u0092s always more proper to use I\u0097true or false? FALSE. Often me is the right word to use. Read the following example:\n\nThere is usually   a haze of  blue smoke surrounding   Jesse and I\nA   B\nin Chem lab, especially when we   mix  together chemicals of\nC\nunknown origin  .   No error  .\nD   E\n\n\n\nIn this example, B is incorrect, since it should read Jesse and me. So how can you tell when to use I and when to use me? It\u0092s got nothing to do with formality or propriety. Me is used as an object of a preposition. I is used as the subject (or part of the subject) of a sentence. \u0093Give that ball to me.\u0094 \u0093The dog and I sped down the lane.\u0094\nIt\u0092s often hard to tell when to use I and when to use me. One of the best ways to tell is to cut out some of the surrounding words. For example, in the sentence above, if you cut out Jesse and from the sentence, you get the phrase smoke surrounding I. Though we told you not to rely on your ear exclusively, examples like this one don\u0092t require a trained ear to detect the error. You\u0092d never say or write the smoke surrounding I. It should leap off the page and shout out its incorrectness to you.\nIt\u0092s always a good idea to double-check your ear. On I/me questions like this example, substitute me for I (or vice versa if the case may be). Here you\u0092d get smoke surrounding Jesse and me, which sounds better and checks out correctly if you drop Jesse and to get smoke surrounding me.\nThe Strange \u0093Cases\u0094 of Me and My\nIt can also be tough to depend solely on your ear to try to figure out whether to use me or my. Look at this sentence:\n\nWhen it  comes to   me  studying for the math tests, \u0093  concentration  \u0094\nA   B   C\nis my middle   name  .   No error  .\nD   E\n\n\n\nAlthough it may sound right, me is actually incorrect in this sentence. The me/my refers to studying. You need a possessive word to indicate that the sentence refers to your study habits. If you use me, the phrase means when it comes to me. The subject of the sentence is not you, it\u0092s your study habits. Using my gives the sentence the possessive meaning it needs to convey.\nPronoun Shift\nThis is a bad thing. A sentence should start, continue, and end with the same kind of pronouns. Pronoun shift occurs when the pronoun type changes over the course of the sentence.\n\nWhen one   first begins  to arm wrestle,   it\u0092s  important to\nA   B\nwork on your endurance and to make   your  biceps appear   formidable  .\nC   D\nNo error  .\nE\n\n\n\nIf you start talking about one, you have to keep talking about one for the duration of the sentence. Therefore, the sentence could read, When one first begins to arm wrestle, it\u0092s important to work on one\u0092s endurance, or, When you first begin to arm wrestle, it\u0092s important to work on your endurance. But the sentence cannot combine one and you. So C is the correct answer.\nAmbiguous Pronouns\nA pronoun is called \u0093ambiguous\u0094 when it\u0092s not absolutely clear what the pronoun refers to. People use ambiguous pronouns all the time when they\u0092re talking. This works out fine in speech, as you can usually make it clear, from context or gestures, what the pronoun refers to. But in writing, you often can\u0092t provide that sort of context. Even if the result sounds awkward, you must make sure it\u0092s absolutely clear what the pronoun refers to. See if you can spot the ambiguous pronoun in the following sentence:\n\nSarah told Emma that   she    had  a serious foot odor problem,\nA   B\nand that  medicated spray   might  help.   No error  .\nC   D   E\n\n\n\nThe pronoun she poses a problem in this sentence. Who has a problem with foot odor, Sarah or Emma? No one knows, because she is ambiguous. Grammatically and logically, she could refer either to Sarah or Emma. Therefore, A is the correct answer.\nComparisons Using Pronouns\nTake special notice whenever you see a comparison made using pronouns. When a pronoun is involved in a comparison, it must match the case of the other pronoun involved:\n\nI\u0092m much stronger than   her  ,   which  is good,   because  it means\nA   B   C\nI\u0092ll dominate  this wrestling match.   No error  .\nD   E\n\n\n\nIn this sentence, I is being compared to her. These two pronouns are in different cases, so one of them must be wrong. Since only her is underlined, it must be wrong, and therefore it\u0092s the right answer.\nAnother way to approach pronouns in comparisons is to realize that comparisons usually omit words. For example, it\u0092s grammatically correct to say, Johanna is stronger than Tom, but that phrase is actually an abbreviated version of what you\u0092re really saying. The long version is, Johanna is stronger than Tom is. That last is is invisible in the abbreviated version, but you must remember that it\u0092s there. Let\u0092s go back to the wrestling sentence for a sec. As in the Johanna and Tom example, the word is is invisible, but it\u0092s implied. If you see a comparison using a pronoun and you\u0092re not sure if the pronoun is correct, add the implied is. In this case, adding is leaves you with I\u0092m much stronger than her is. That sounds wrong, so you know that she is the correct pronoun in this case.\nTake a look at this similar sentence:\n\nBrock Lesner   is  a   better  professional wrestler   than    them  .\nA   B   C   D\nNo error  .\nE\n\n\n\nIn this comparison the word are is implied, since in this sentence the pronoun them is plural. Adding are leaves you with Brock Lesner is a better professional wrestler than them are. That sounds dead wrong, so you know that the sentence should read Brock Lesner is a better professional wrestler than they, and that D is the right answer.\nScrew-Up 2: Subject-Verb Agreement\nThe fundamental rule about the grammatical relationships between subjects and verbs is this:\nIf you have a singular subject, you must use a singular verb. If you have a plural subject, you must use a plural verb.\nIt sounds simple, and usually it is. For example, you know that it\u0092s incorrect to say candy are good or concerts is fun.\nHowever, in a few instances, subject-verb agreement can get hairy. There are four varieties of subject-verb problems the SAT Writing section loves to test:\nWhen the subject comes after the verb\nWhen the subject and verb are separated\nWhen you have an either/or or neither/nor construction\nWhen the subject seems plural but isn\u0092t\nRemember, it\u0092s not necessary to remember the name of the problem\u0097you certainly don\u0092t have to memorize this list. It\u0092s only necessary to check subjects and verbs carefully to see if they match up. Knowing the different ways subjects and verbs can go astray will help you check more efficiently.\nSubject After the Verb\nIn most sentences, the subject comes before the verb. The SAT tries to throw you off by giving you a sentence or two in which the subject comes after the verb and the subject-verb match-up is incorrect.\n\nEven though  Esther created a petition to protest the   crowning\nA   B\nof a Prom Queen,   there is  many people who refused to sign,\nC\nsaying they support the   1950s-era  tradition.   No error  .\nD   E\n\n\n\nThe SAT frequently uses this exact formulation, so be wary if you see a comma followed by the word there. In this kind of sentence, it\u0092s tempting to assume that just because the word there comes before the verb is, there is the subject\u0097but it\u0092s not. People is the subject. And since people is plural, the matching verb also must be plural. Is is a singular verb, and therefore incorrect in this sentence.\nEven when you don\u0092t see the red flag of there is, don\u0092t just assume that the subject always comes before the verb. Look at the following sentence:\n\nAtop  my sundae, a colossal   mass  of ice cream,   whipped cream  ,\nA   B   C\nand sprinkles,   sits  two maraschino cherries.   No error  .\nD   E\n\n\n\nTricky! The answer is D, sits. Because the things doing the sitting are two maraschino cherries (plural subject), you need to use sit (plural verb). The sentence should read Atop my sundae, a colossal mass of ice cream, whipped cream, and sprinkles, sit two maraschino cherries. Why is this so sneaky? The subject, maraschino cherries, comes after the verb, sits. With all the singular stuff floating around\u0097one sundae, one mass of ice cream and whipped cream\u0097it\u0092s easy to assume that the verb should be singular, too. Look out for that kind of backwards construction.\nSubject and Verb Are Separated\nOne of the SAT\u0092s most diabolical tricks is to put the subject here and the verb waaaaay over yonder. The test-writers hope that by the time you get to the verb, you\u0092ll forget the subject and end up baffled.\n\nSundaes with whipped cream and cherries,   while  good   if consumed\nA   B\nin moderation,   is heinous  if eaten   for breakfast,  lunch,\nC   D\nand dinner.   No error  .\nE\n\n\n\nIn this sentence, the subject (sundaes) is at the beginning of the sentence, while the verb (is) is miles away. When this happens, it\u0092s helpful to bracket clauses that separate the subject and the verb so you can still see how the subject and verb should relate. If you ignore the phrase here (while good if consumed in moderation), you\u0092re left with sundaes is heinous. That\u0092s grammatically heinous. So C is the right answer.\nNeither/Nor and Either/Or\nIn neither/nor and either/or constructions, you\u0092re always talking about two things, so it\u0092s tempting to assume that you always need a plural verb.\nBut if the two things being discussed are singular, you need a singular verb. For example, it\u0092s correct to say, Neither Jason nor Sandra acts well, because if you broke the components of the sentence in two, you would get Jason acts well and Sandra acts well. It\u0092s incorrect to say, Neither Jason or Sandra act well, because if you break that sentence into its components, you get Jason act well and Sandra act well.\nIt can be hard to hear this error, so be sure to check subject-verb match-ups carefully when you see a sentence like this one:\n\nNeither  Kylie   nor  Jason   measure  up to   Carrie  .   No error  .\nA   B   C   D   E\n\n\n\n\n\nEven though the sentence mentions two people (Jason and Kylie) who don\u0092t measure up to Carrie, both of those people are singular nouns. Therefore, the verb must be singular. Measure is a plural verb, when it should be a singular one, so C is the answer.\nTricky Singular Subjects that Seem Plural\nThere are a bunch of confusing subjects out there that are singular but masquerade as plural. It\u0092s easy to get tripped up by these singular subjects and mistakenly match them with plural verbs. Here are the leading culprits:\nanybody either audience nobody\nanyone group each none\nAmerica number everybody no one\namount neither everyone\n\nIn this sentence, for example, nobody seems plural:\n\nOf all of the   students  in my class, nobody, not   even me  ,\nA   B\nare  excited about   the new teacher  .   No error  .\nC   D   E\n\n\n\nNobody is always a singular noun, so it needs to be matched with a singular verb. The answer is C. The sentence should read, Of all the students in my class, nobody, not even me, is excited about the new teacher. Look carefully at all seemingly plural subjects to make sure they\u0092re not singular subjects masquerading as plural ones.\nBe particularly careful with phrases like as well as, along with, and in addition to. Like the neither/nor construction, these phrases can trick you into thinking they require a plural verb.\n\nThe leadoff hitter,   as well as  the cleanup hitter,   are  getting\nA   B\nsome   good  hits   tonight  .   No error  .\nC   D   E\n\n\n\nThe actual subject here is leadoff hitter. Since leadoff hitter is a singular subject, the verb must be singular, too. The presence of the phrase as well as does not make the subject plural. Even though there are two hitters doing well, the leadoff hitter is the only subject of this sentence. B is the answer; the sentence should read, The leadoff hitter, as well as the cleanup hitter, is getting some good hits tonight. If the sentence used an and instead of an as well as, so that it read, The leadoff hitter and the cleanup hitter are getting some good hits tonight, then are would be correct. It\u0092s that as well as construction that changes things.\nScrew-Up 3: Tenses\nIdentifying Sentence Errors questions test your knowledge of three common causes of tense errors. We explain each type in detail below.\nAnnoying verbs\nIllogical tense switches\nThe conditional\nVery Annoying Verbs\nVery annoying verbs never sound quite right in any tense\u0097like to lie, to swim,or to drink. When do you lay and when do you lie? When do you swim and when have you swum? When did you drank and why are you drunk? Forget that last one.\nYou LIE down for a nap.\nYou LAY something down on the table.\nYou LAY down yesterday.\nYou SWIM across the English Channel.\nYou SWAM across the Atlantic Ocean last year.\nYou had SWUM across the bathtub as a child.\nYou DRINK a glass of water every morning.\nYou DRANK a glass of water yesterday.\nYou have DRUNK three gallons of water this week.\n\nYou\u0092ll probably see one question that will test your knowledge of a confusing verb like to lie. Look at this sentence, for example:\n\nOn  Saturday afternoon, I   laid  in the sun   for an hour  , working\nA   B   C\non my   tan  .   No error  .\nD   E\n\n\n\nB is the correct answer here, because laid is not the correct tense in the context of this sentence. The past tense of to lie is lay, so the sentence should read I lay in the sun.\nUnfortunately, there\u0092s no easy memory trick to help you remember when to use which verb form. The only solution is to learn and memorize. To simplify that task, we\u0092re providing a table of difficult verbs in infinitive, simple past, and past participle forms. You don\u0092t have to know those technical terms, but it\u0092s well worth your time to look at the list below and learn as many of these as you can:\nInfinitive Simple Past Past Participle\narise arose arisen\nbecome became become\nbegin began begun\nblow blew blown\nbreak broke broken\nchoose chose chosen\ncome came come\ndive dived/dove dived\ndo did done\ndraw drew drawn\ndrink drank drunk\ndrive drove driven\ndrown drowned drowned\ndwell dwelt/dwelled dwelt/dwelled\neat ate eaten\nfall fell fallen\nfight fought fought\nflee fled fled\nfling flung flung\nfly flew flown\nforget forgot forgotten\nfreeze froze frozen\nget got gotten\ngive gave given\ngo went gone\ngrow grew grown\nhang (a thing) hung hung\nhang (a person) hanged hanged\nknow knew known\nlay laid laid\nlead led led\nlie (to recline) lay lain\nlie (tell fibs) lied lied\nput put put\nride rode ridden\nring rang rung\nrise rose risen\nrun ran run\nsee saw seen\nset set set\nshine shone/shined shone\nshake shook shaken\nshrink shrank shrunk\nshut shut shut\nsing sang sung\nsink sank sunk\nsit sat sat\nspeak spoke spoken\nspring sprang sprung\nsting stung stung\nstrive strove/strived striven/strived\nswear swore swore\nswim swam swum\nswing swung swung\ntake took taken\ntear tore torn\nthrow threw thrown\nwake woke/waken waked/woken\nwear wore worn\nwrite wrote written\n\nTense Switch\nYou don\u0092t always need to use the same tense throughout a sentence. For example, you can say:\nI used to eat chocolate bars exclusively, but after going through a conversion experience last year, I have broadened my range and now eat gummy candy, too.\n\nThis sentence has several tense switches, but they\u0092re logical and correct: The sentence uses past tense when it refers to the past and present tense when it talks about the present, and the progression from past to present makes sense.\nThe SAT gives you a sentence or two with incorrect tense switches. Here\u0092s an example:\n\nAt swimming pools  last summer, the heat   will have brought\nA   B\nhundreds and even   thousands of people  to   bathe  in chlorine-infested\nC   D\nwaters.   No error  .\nE\n\n\n\nThis sentence begins by talking about the past (last summer), but then uses the phrase will have brought, which refers to the future. The phrase will have brought doesn\u0092t fit because it suggests something continuing from the present to the future, whereas the sentence should be rooted entirely in the past. Therefore, B is the correct answer. Always be sure that the sentence\u0092s tenses match the time frame (past, present, or future) in which the subject is discussed.\nThe Conditional\nYour parents are supposed to give you unconditional love, meaning they love you even though you refuse to be seen in public with them. So it stands to reason that the conditional is a verb form used to describe something uncertain, or dependent on something else. Conditional sentences are often characterized by the presence of the word if. The conditional requires a different conjugation of some verb forms, most notably the verb to be. For example, in the past tense, you\u0092d write, \u0093I was a good student and got good grades.\u0094 In the present tense, you\u0092d write, \u0093I am a good student and get good grades.\u0094 That\u0092s all fine and familiar so far, right? The conditional is different, however. In the conditional, you\u0092d write, \u0093If I were a good student, I would get good grades.\u0094\nTo conquer conditionals on the SAT, look out for the word if and memorize this simple formula to use the correct conjugation: \u0093If . . . were . . . would.\u0094 Here\u0092s an example:\n\nIf I   was  to see a   movie  with Mom and Dad, I   would  risk\nA   B   C\nmy  reputation.   No error  .\nD   E\n\n\n\nWas may sound right to you on first reading this sentence, but when in doubt, remember the formula. Was violates the formula and therefore is incorrect. The sentence should read, If I were to see a movie with Mom and Dad, I would risk my reputation. A is the right answer.\nScrew-Up 4: Parallelism\nParallel lines line up neatly with each other, right? Parallelism in writing means that the different components of a sentence start, continue, and end in the same way. It\u0092s especially common to find errors of parallelism in sentences that list actions or items. When you see a list of any sort, be on the alert for an error in parallelism. In the question below, for example, the activities are not presented in the same format, which means there is a parallelism error.\n\nJack never liked   bathing the dog  ,   feeding  the llamas, or\nA   B\nto ride  his personal   roller coaster  .   No error  .\nC   D   E\n\n\n\nA gerund is a funny word for something you already know well                "}, {"date": "2007-08-18T00:19:18+00:00", "url": "http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/college-search-selection/383286-net-university-spending-per-student.html", "messages": "\n                    I was playing with IPEDs and Excel today, and made some calculations to determine the amount of money that a variety of colleges and universities spend on their students. I calculated the total amount of money in student spending by combining 3 IPEDs categories: Instructional spending per student, Academic Support spending per student, and Student Services spending per student (note that this does not include Research spending, among other areas, as the vast majority of such spending, though not all, does not directly benefit undergrads. A few other such categories were also left out, including Public Service spending, and Institutional Support spending). All of these numbers include graduate and professional school students in both the money spent numbers and the total student numbers, so they may not perfectly reflect undergrad spending.\nI then decided that another important component was how much the student must spend to receive these services. I therefore subtracted the tuition and fees revenue per student from the previously calculated number. Note that the tuition and fees number is not simply the list cost. Financial aid provided by the school does not result in revenue, so the tuition and fees numbers are all less than the amount actually charged by the university. These numbers would be different for someone paying the list price. Moreover, for public universities, these numbers reflect the ratio of in-state to out-of-state students. Since out-of-state students pay more tuition, having a large number of such students will inflate revenue, hurting a school's numbers in this listing. And, obviously, the real ranking for an individual would depend on whether a given public school is in-state or out-of-state.\nWithout further ado (in rank order, institutional spending per student on students minus the amount of tuition and fees received per student, in dollars):\nYale University\t95549\nCalifornia Institute of Technology 87892\nWashington University in St Louis 59634\nStanford University 55399\nJohns Hopkins University 54346\nHarvard University 50878\nUniversity of Chicago 42313\nPrinceton University 38327\nDartmouth College 37888\nColumbia University in the City of New York 34549\nUniversity of Pennsylvania 33723\nRice University\t26496\nWilliams College 24618\nUniversity of California-Los Angeles 24218\nSwarthmore College 21068\nUniversity of North Carolina at Chapel Hill 20503\nPomona College 20366\nDuke University 19857\nNorthwestern University\t18307\nCornell University 15468\nUniversity of California-San Diego 15458\nAmherst College\t13783\nHarvey Mudd College 13155\nBrown University 12908\nMiddlebury College 11740\nUniversity of California-Berkeley 11521\nUniversity of Wisconsin-Madison\t10148\nUniversity of Michigan-Ann Arbor 7199\nGeorgetown University 6461\nUniversity of Virginia-Main Campus 5154\n\nInteresting results. One thing that particularly surprised me was the amount of variation among schools in the UC system. UCLA is spending far more per student than Berkeley or SD. Perhaps UCLA is really the UC school where one should go to get his or her money's worth.\nAnother thing to note is how high WashU is. Despite the amount of bashing it gets on these boards, it clearly invests a lot of resources in its students (and this does not include research money, so its medical research is not affecting the results). Some of the CC favorites don't do so well. Brown, an Ivy, does worse than all but 6 other schools out of the 30 I looked at.\nOne note about Michigan. It had a particularly high tuition revenue per student number for a state university. I believe it has many more out of state  students compared to the other public universities I looked at, so its ranking would rise more for an in-state student than any of the other publics.\nObviously I can't say for sure that universities aren't reporting number differently from each other. I will be the first to admit that the magnitude of some of the differences is somewhat surprising (particularly Yale/Caltech vs the rest of the field). On the other hand, these numbers are from a federal database, and one would hope that institutions are accurately reporting data to the government.\nI'm willing to calculate the numbers for more schools if people are interested (I decided to focus first on the ones that get the most interest on these boards). But don't expect me to respond immediately. I'm also open to suggestions to improve the methodology.

I wrote this on another blog and I think it is an interesting and applicable topic to write about.\nI may or may not use it in the application but I just wanted to share it because it is really interesting in my opinion.\n\n\nTo me, Tool's Lateralus is the most amazing piece of music ever composed. I think Tool deliberately wanted to give their fans something truly amazing, but wanted them to find it on their own. \"Recognize this as a holy gift...\" At first, I thought that the song Lateralus was about tripping acid - discovering true color by seperating the body from the mind. At first listen, I imagined the bending envelope as an intense visual. After becoming more familiar with the track, however, I had reformed my interpretation to something broader: think deeper. Lateralus, perhaps because it is the album's \"title track\", serves as the central clue for a puzzle that a friend of mine had read about somewhere on the internet. \"All I know is that there is a different order for the songs - something about two spirals. Oh yeah, and thirteen is in the middle.\" After scavenging through endless google search results, I gave up on finding more about this 'alternate order'. Intent to figure the album out, and very curious about the spirals - I put on the proverbial 'thinking cap'. I understood how the spirals could have a lot of significance, in that the album's title track offers the inspiring, \"swing on the spiral of our divinity and still be a human..........And following our will and wind we may just go where no one's been. We'll ride the spiral to the end and may just go where no one's been.\" In my internet scavenging, I had read one review, written by a drummer, who mentioned that Danny Carey's drum beat formed a fibonacci sequence during the song Lateralus. A drummer myself, I decided to get out the graph paper and follow Danny. I can't play like he can, but at least I can hear everything he's doing, and thus was able to construct the drum tabulature. Sure enough, Danny repeats a Fibonacci sequence through the number 13: 1,1,2,3,5,8,13. After 13, he starts again with 1. Bringing in my Algebra 2 knowledge of the Fibonacci sequence, when the equation for the Fibonacci sequence (which I don't actually know) is graphed, it forms a sprial whose vertex depends on the number at which the sequence begins. Coincidence? I began to think not. I had already known of Danny's obsession with sacred geometry and am familiar with Bob Frissell's book, Nothing in This Book Is True, But It's Exactly How Things Are , so the significance of what I had stumbled upon had actually begun to settle in. This is where I just had to play with Lateralus. I had doodled a few spirals in the corners of my graph paper, and in doing so made the first important connection to Lateralus. I knew that if the tracks were in fact intended to be heard in a different order, \"Parabol\" and \"Parabola\" would have to go together. In drawing my spirals, I had begun with a vertex and 'spiraled' outwards. After writing the numbers 1 through 13 linearly, I could immediately see that Parabol and Parabola would have to be the middle of my spiral (in that 13 / 2 = 6.5). I drew a simple arrow between 6 and 7 and then pondered the next pair. At first, I actually drew a spiral connecting pairs of numbers whose sum equaled 13 (the number of songs on the album). This, however, left the last track in the same position and without anything to connect to. At this time, I had used my copy of Lateralus and Cool Edit Pro to take out the silences between tracks and put the songs in the following order: 6,7,5,8,4,9,3,10,2,11,1,12,13. The transition from Parabola into Schism blew my mind, as the plucks, probably dismissed by listeners as a drawn out rant of an ending, perfectly transition into the beginning of Schism. When you count out beats as the strings are plucked, Schism resumes with the same time signature and tempo - mirroring the progression of notes. The transition from Schism into Ticks & Leeches is equally intriguing. Schism ends with strong double-kick bass and tom smacks, and Ticks & Leeches begins with what many would call a 'tribal' drum beat. The beat at the very start of Ticks & Leeches is slightly different every subsequent time it is repeated - the measures are two beats longer. Yup - you guessed it - those two beats are ACTUALLY the last two beats of Schism. I can honestly say that I never understood the album's fourth track, Mantra until reordering the album's songs. What I had originally heard as whale calls now had begun to resemble the worst imaginable dry heaves - or a stylized choking. Fitting, seeing as how the last line in Ticks & Leeches is \"I hope you choke.\" After this transition, none of those following it really seemed to make much sense. I certainly didn't like that Disposition and Reflection had been seperated - as they sound quite good when played sequentially on the album. This was the only real roadblock in my disciphering of the Holy Gift. Then I had remembered what my friend had told me - 13 was in the middle. At the time, probably just wanting to believe that there was more to this cd, I had equated this to the positioning of the song \"Intermission\" on the previous release,                 "}, {"date": "2007-09-03T15:30:13+00:00", "url": "http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/sat-preparation/389552-someone-please-score-my-sat-essay.html", "messages": "\n                    Here is my essay\n\nPrompt:\nDo changes that make our lives easier not necessarily make them better?\nPlan and write an essay in which you develop your point of view on this issue. Support your position with reasoning and examples taken from your reading, studies, experience, or observations.\n\nSome changes in our lives like car or email have made our lives easier. Ironically using machines to work relentlessly for us we have become relentless ourselves. According to Karen Finucan\u0092s Life in the Fast Lane, \u0093Technology, promises to make our lives easier, freeing up time for Leisure pursuits. These changes which have seemed to make our lives easier actually increased our work capacity making us relentless machines. Two examples of such changes are the cotton gin and the assembly line.\nThe Cotton gin was invented by Eli Whitney in 1793. At that time many slaves worked on southern cotton plantations in the U.S. Eli\u0092s invention let the slaves work on more cotton in a shorter time period. This invention seemed to assuage their workload but due to the slaveholder\u0092s avarice actually made it increase. With the ability to do more in less time, the slaves were forced to work more. This example shows how an invention that was meant to reduce workload actually increased it due to greed. The Cotton gin is not the only change that seemed to make life easier but in turn make life worse. Another example is the assembly line.\nThe assembly line much like the Cotton gin made workers relentless machines. With the assembly line built the manager could get more profit in less time. This means that possibly the workers could work fewer hours as the same profit was made. Yet as most managers care primarily about profits rather than worker\u0092s conditions they increased the worker\u0092s workload.\nOverall we can see that changes that were meant to alleviate our lives actually increased our workloads. Yet the underlying cause of this is due to the inevitable human nature of greed. We tend to want more profit, more end result. With the power of technology we tend to work more due to avarice and the sight of a better product. Technology is like a rose, it is aesthetic on the outside but when we get closer to it and realize its effects, it can hurt us with its prickly facade.\n\nPlease be honest when grading it...\nI really want to improve my essay because on my last essay I got an 8..\nCould you not only state the score but also explain how I could improve..\nThank you!

For a long time, I wanted to double major in both (in 4 years of college; paying for an additional year of college isn't an option in my situation), but that seems impractical now.\n\nEconomics actually interests me as a pure subject. I've read the textbooks, loved them, etc. etc. etc. It's an interesting topic that I can go on and on about and could probably really get into in college.\n\nAerospace Engineering, in contrast, simply seemed like a viable second major to me as a result of my always loving those \"Space Plane\"/\"Dive From Space\" (to name some recent examples) articles in Popular Science. I consider myself a \"space enthusiast\" and love seeing how space entrepreneurship (Virgin Galactic and the like) will develop in the coming future. I love looking at photographs of space shuttles, ISS modules, etc. etc.\n\nHowever, I've always had mixed feelings about high school physics classes. I enjoyed the mechanics portion (which alas was over in a few brief months), as I could visualize how it related to the real world, but the bits on electromagnetism, circuits, etc. seriously did not even come close to sparking my interests. It was plain out \"boring\" for me, to be honest.\n\nI enjoy the more abstract math taught in math classes (it's like \"playing a game/solving a puzzle\"), but I've never especially cared for the applied math used in physics.\n\nMy problems with physics, on which Aerospace Engineering obviously depends, may be more of a problem with the teaching style used in my high school (\"don't question, just plug the stuff into the formulas and you're done\"). One doesn't get a sense of the flow of ideas (how the formulas were developed, etc.) at all, as one does in math [class] if one tries.\n\nIn theory, topics like aerodynamics (for takeoff, i suppose?), which are covered in college, appeal to me. However, I don't know if that appeal is strong enough and if it'll actually persist when I start courses in college (In economics, I've already taken college courses and read the textbooks, so I know the appeal).\n\nThus, I was wondering whether some of the people with Aerospace knowledge on this forum might suggest whether I'd do a better job of satisfying my interest in space by subscribing to some space magazines and following along the business side of it, rather than attempting to go in and understand the engineering involved? I was thinking that Economics might actually lead me to an understanding of space sooner than Aerospace Engineering would, as both government spending on space programs and Entrepreneurship is distinctly tied to the costs and benefits of space development. Perhaps someday I could even work in the business end of a space-related corporation? What's your opinion? Should I be a \"Space Economist\" rather than trying to become an aerospace* engineer?\n\n*It's worth mentioning that the \"aero\" part of aerospace hasn't really interested me traditionally. Some of the military plane stuff is cool, but I can't say I've ever especially cared for commercial air flight. Is this yet another sign that I shouldn't go for aerospace engineering? Furthermore, closely related fields like Mechanical Engineering really don't get me excited at all nowadays, am I just better off staying away from Engineering if I want to do well? Is my interest in \"Aerospace Engineering\" only superficial and unrelated to the engineering component?\n\nThanks a lot, I'll be very thankful for the feedback.\n\nP.S. Some colleges seem to actually offer a minor in Aerospace Engineering that can be taken by non-Engineering students (!). Do you think that such a thing would be interesting to me and not a waste of time, or do you find the concept ridiculous? Should it influence my college choice? Thanks!

For the review, it hired some 800 college faculty members to evaluate syllabi that high schools submitted for the AP courses they offer.\n\nSixty-seven percent of the courses met the requirements and received immediate approval. Thirty-three percent did not. Teachers of those courses were given a chance to submit their syllabi again after making adjustments, and those courses are being evaluated anew.\n\nAs a result of the audit, \"college admissions officials, students, parents, and educators can have continued confidence that the AP designation on students' transcripts is only allowed for syllabi that have been approved by college faculty,\" said Trevor Packer, vice president for the Advanced Placement program at the College Board.\n\nIn the 2006-7 academic year, 16,464 schools offered AP courses, according to College Board figures. Following the audit, there are now 14,383 schools offering such courses in the 2007-8 academic year.\n\nThe results of the audit, known as the AP Course Ledger, are available in a searchable format on the College Board's Web site.\n\n\nAn Admissions Tool\n\nAP courses, are, in theory, designed to prepare high-school students to take an exam in a particular subject and, if they score high enough, earn them college credit. Some colleges also factor in a high-school student's participation in AP courses in admissions decisions. But for college admissions officers sifting through thousands of high-school transcripts, one of the many uncertainties is the authenticity of the \"AP\" label.\n\nThough a successful score on an AP test would probably indicate that the course preceding it was rigorous, most college admissions officers, because of the timing of the AP exams, which often come at the end of a student's senior year, never see the student's actual AP test scores. As a result, they have no way of determining how challenging a particular AP course is.\n\nThe College Board's audit could help admissions officers determine the integrity of such courses, said David A. Hawkins, director of public policy and research for the National Association for College Admission Counseling.\n\n\"The benefit, at least the intended benefit,\" Mr. Hawkins said, is that admissions officers \"would be able to rely on the transcript\" and not have to call the school to determine the validity of the AP label. \"It will be saving some time from the admissions process,\" he said, \"though not an overwhelming amount.\"\n\nThe audit could also prove helpful for admissions officers when they receive applications from an unfamiliar high school where the strength of its curriculum is unknown, he said.\n\n\nMaking the Grade\n\nThe audit, which was first announced in 2004, was conducted in three stages, Mr. Packer said.\n\nFirst, the College Board required schools to remove the AP label from courses that were not one of the subjects for which there are AP exams.\n\nNext, teachers of AP courses were asked to perform a \"self audit\" and compare their courses with the academic criteria established by a group of college faculty members for each of the AP subjects. If the course did not meet those expectations, and was unlikely to do so within the next academic year, the College Board advised removing the AP label from the course.\n\nMore than 2,000 schools said they were unable to keep the AP label on some courses.\n\n\"That was a positive and powerful outcome of the audit,\" Mr. Packer said. \"Right up front, a certain number of schools realized that they should not be indicating to colleges that they're offering college-level courses by labeling them Advanced Placement.\"\n\nFinally, the faculty members evaluated syllabi for the 134,000 remaining courses and approved 67 percent of them. Though a final pass rate for all of the courses is not yet known, Mr. Packer estimated that at least 85 to 90 percent would ultimately be approved.\n\nThe audit will be updated annually as schools add to and revise the Advanced Placement courses they offer. And if a school wants to add any new AP subject areas, it will have to go through the audit again, Mr. Packer said.\n\n\nCopyright                 "}, {"date": "2007-11-18T22:40:26+00:00", "url": "http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/university-california-berkeley/419557-anyone-familiar-with-the-online-application-process-for-internationals-need-help.html", "messages": "\n                    International student here.

I;m talking about a school in the silicon valley that doesn't offer a computer programming or any computer related course (well, maybe computer graphics design course).\nAnyway, two seniors (one ranked #1 and #2) applied SCEA and got in. I will tell you of the person #1 and the rank #2 guy is same, if not low in calibur, compared to the rank #1 person.\n\nThis person brought the concept of \"science bowl\" to school. She created an environmental recycling club and she attended some random ecology activity course in New Hampshire. She did take lots of AP courses and got good SAT scores (2100+). She made teams for different science quiz bowls and she participated --- the school participated --- for the first time. She lost the quiz bowl hard. Again she tried next year, and for various quiz bowls, but the highest she was able to attain was \"semi-finalist\". This person didn't even qualify for AIME . . .\n\nI went to collegeconfidential's Stats profiles of different people and The Official SCEA results thread. I saw winners of quiz bowls, USAMO qualifiers, Intel ISEF Filanists, USABO, IPHO, so many other persuers of unique activities getting rejected.\nI didn't quite get something. This girl in my school who is from CA, sillicon valley, who is nowhere compared to the people here, is actually accepted to Stanford.\n\nI came to think differently now. She went to a bad school and shined, bringing new activities and all sort. Is this better than doing the routine ISEF, AIME, USABO? Does the environment you come from actually affect your admission to SCEA? Then why not a bright person study in a poor school and shine, thus gaining admission to SCEA?\nI came to formulate this:\nStudy in a poorly academic school. Shine there, bring new things there such as academic clubs and introducing the school to quiz bowls ans other competitions and any other things you can think of. SCEA will at least defer you if not accept.\n\nI have observed this case on actually 6 other people from different schools. So, I am not basing this from one person.

Believe me, I know, I was (and still am) one of you. I'm a fairly normal 17 year old from a small school in California. But a couple years ago I was diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Obssessive Compulsive Disorder, and Depression: all which were as a result of the college admissions process. The reason I am writing this isn't simply to tell my story, but to share with every individual here some insight that might help you as you enter or leave this crazy jungle that is college admissions. I'm officially done with this process. Accepted here and there, waitlisted here and there, and most definitely rejected to numerous schools. But even as I got my rejection from my top school moments ago, I was upset for about 5 minutes and soon after, experienced a feeling that I hadn't felt in the four years of high school: happiness. Happiness as a result of finally feeling some relaxation and knowing that no matter what, no matter what college I attend, no matter what friends I make, I know I would be happy.\nAs early as I can remember, college has been a permanent stress in my mind, always pushing me to work a little bit harder, stay up a little later to study, skip hanging out with friends to work on a project, and other tedious things in order to get a simple point higher for a grade and to eventually get into college. There's one thing you should know before I go any further. I am not, by any means, a naturally smart individual. I know, I know, am I being harsh on myself? No, I'm just being honest. I always work significantly harder than another individual just to get the same grade. I always exert myself way more than I should just to match up to my classmates. Maybe this isn't what defines intelligence. But in the context of my small high school in which over half my class can score above a 2300 and not have studied a single day, intelligence was defined FOR me by my classmates and teachers. My freshman year started out rocky. I, unfortunately, am a sensitive person and was not accustomed to have individuals talk about me 'behind my back' or deceive me. Individuals made fun of every possible aspect about me, not because I did a single thing to deserve it, but because I refused to stop them. As a result of this, I set my mind 100% percent on college. I wanted to leave my small town and discover an entirely different life where I could choose who I wanted to be. So day in an day out, I worked and worked and worked.\nThen depression hit. I've had a family history of it, so it was not necessarily a surprise, but my entire life was devoted to college. I spent every moment of my life thinking about it and more importantly, how much MORE I should be thinking about it. I went to therapy, but found it ultimately unsuccessful, having to practice breathing exercises and talking about my feelings. Believe me, for an angsty pubescent teenager, talking about my feelings is difficult.\nThen a couple years later, I entered hell. And by hell, I mean Junior year. My depression began to convert to full-blown anxiety. I spent so much of my time being anxious and scared to the point where I had several anxiety attacks that landed me in the hospital with an IV tube in my arm and bandages for wounds that I didn't remember I had made. I guess the best way I can write about my junior year experience comes from a journal entry I wrote during that year in a writing class. Maybe this will help.\n\"As confident and content as I once was, is how confused and indecisive as I now am, but content with everything around me for the time being. It's a temporary stage, hopefully, but one that I cannot imagine leaving anytime soon. I guess high school ultimately brought out feelings that I've never even felt before or lightly experienced, which explains why I'm at the pinnacle of these four years, being Junior year. I guess the thing that has made me change so incredibly much is the feeling of instablity that is so permanent in my life. I never know what I'm going to do next, and it scares me, humorously and seriously. I can never seem to amass the confidence or self-assurance that is so neccessary for life and its occurences that I ever had. But I manage to stay true to myself and find the best in each and every situation. I've always envied others for almost every single aspect imaginable. I'm so incredibly insecure to the point where I can't nearly act as normally as I could be on a daily basis. But I hide it. That is where I am at fault most. I hide everything. I hide my problems, fears, and insecurities which brings about my daily anxiety. After having to go to therapy, I couldn't possibly recoup my entire personality. I lied to my therapist everyday with the single question, \"How are you today\", and the single reply, \"Good.\"  I have so much to decide in so little time, and I guess the relatively simply decision of choosing a college brought about these feelings once more. My anxiety is something I cannot for the life of me, control. After a complete breakdown in front of 20 of my classmates that I couldn't stop, for lack of a better word, I hide. I cannot face anything head on anymore, and in some ways have lost a part of who I truly am. But I love the people around me and the opportunities I have. Because of the environment that I am in, insufficency and self-worthlessness can aptly describe who I am. My insecurities are, sadly, who I am. I wish for so much, but never truly learn to appreciate what I am now, because I've never received that sort of attention. I could only hope that I pick myself up from this state, and figure out, or at least get a grasp of who I really truly am. To any of you reading, I love, I hate, and I hurt. But most importantly, I am on a constant and persistant journey to grow and hopefully achieve the hopes and aspirations that I have. If you were to ask me, what I would hope for in my life in ten years, I would simply hope that I have learned to fully appreciate who I am, through whatever method that makes me happiest.\"\nAnd then Senior year began. And to put it as concise as possible, I was rejected from not only my top choice school, but several of them as well moments ago. I don't expect any of you to read this in its entirety. I'm actually surprised that I have written this much. But what I wanted to say to all disapointed seniors and anxious juniors is to enjoy the time left you have in high school. If I had been told that four years ago, it would have changed my life. But instead, I came to this realization 3 and a half years too late. Even if this helps any of you a little, I'll be glad that I was able to even help slightly. What I want you to do now may seem crazy but try it. Avoid collegeconfidential. Avoid concerning yourself over minute details on a project. Avoid stressing out about extracurricular activities. I read college confidential everyday for the past couple years, and believe me, the time that I spent on here is incredible. I want you all to enjoy what you have and not be concerned about whats around the corner. Even though I'm at school everyday, I always spent my time thinking about the future and never had the time to value where I was at that very moment. After all, what's a high school experience worth if you're never really there?

But I\u0092ve been frustrated by the slipperiness of the data provided in the headline statistics.  A summary measure is provided in US News\u0092 tables, where they give (1) the % of classes of 50 or more, (2) the % of classes of 20 or less, and (3) the median class size.  For instance, Stanford has 10% of its classes over 50 students.  But this doesn\u0092t mean that the average Stanford student will be in a class of over 50 students only 10% of the time \u0096 actually, they will have a class over 50 students almost 50% of the time.\n\nWhy the difference?  Intuitively, it\u0092s because there are a lot more students in a large class than a small one, and therefore the large classes carry a lot more weight than smaller classes in the overall experience of the student body.  The US News indicators do not perform such a weighting.  So what I\u0092ve done below is to show summary results below obtained by appropriately weighting class size data (from the Common Data Set for each institution; Harvard\u0092s is from their viewbook data based on Fall 2006 courses).  I\u0092ve presented the results for some colleges and univs below, and followed with some more details on the rationale and methodology (and in case I\u0092ve made some mistakes, any comments or corrections are welcome).\n\nThe numbers below present answers to the following questions:\nWhat % of an average student\u0092s classes would be over 50 students?  Below 20 students? And what would be the average class size encountered? (although I think the averages are less useful than the >50 or <20 questions)\n\nSome top LACs:\nSwarthmore: 9% >50, 48% <20, avg. 27\nPomona: 5%, 50%, 24\nCarleton: 5%, 42% 25\nGrinnell: 0%, 43%, 22\nAmherst: 16%, 49% 33\nOberlin: 13%, 44%, 33\nWesleyan: 20%, 36%, 38\n\nHYPS:\nYale: 40%, 38%, 74\nPrinceton: 47%, 33%, 85\nStanford: 49%, 31%, 83\nHarvard: 55%, 26%, 120\n\nAn explanation of the rationale/methodology:  For a simplified example, assume that a college has 50 classes with 2 students in each class (i.e. total of 50*2=100 \u0093student experiences\u0094) and 10 classes with 90 students each (i.e. total of 90*10=900 \u0093student experiences\u0094).  So there are a total of 1000 \u0093student experiences\u0094, of which 90% are in classes of 90 and 10% in classes of 2.  In other words, the average student will have a 90% chance of being in a class above 50, a 10% chance of being in a class below 20.  This is in contrast to the US News manner of presenting the numbers: they would say that only 17% of the classes were above 90 (i.e. 10 out of 60 classes) and 83% below 20.  While their statement is true, I don\u0092t think it is as useful as the other way of looking at the data.\n\nAnother way to think about this is that if each student has for example 10 classes (and hence there are 100 students), you could think of each student having, on average, 9 classes of 90 students each and 1 class of 2 students.  And so the weighted average class size encountered by each student would be approx 81.\n\nYou can also calculate weighted average medians if you prefer those to the mean (in doing so, you should also interpolate the results so that you don\u0092t have large discontinuities).\n\nbtw one assumption I had to make was for the average class size above 100 (since the CDS just says greater than 100).  I assumed 150 for the LACs and 200 for the national univs (200 was Harvard's average class size above 100).

I thought i was going to do well on it,  as I am a pretty good student in school.  I had never taken the ACT before,  so i took it cold.  Here were my results the first time I took it.\n\nC:18\nE:17\nM:22\nM:17\nS:16\n\nThen after taking the test a year later, here is what i got\n\nC:31\nE:35\nM:35\nR:30\nS:25\n\n\nSo here is what i did to raise my score.  At my school,  I got one of those free ACT practice test booklets that the ACT hands out every year.  You can go to actstudent.org and find them.\n\nThen i went and i got the red act book.\n\n\nBefore  I started to study,  I went around looking for official practice tests from the ACT.  I knew that these would be the only \"real\"  way to gauge what I could do.  I got my June '07 with the answers back.   Then I found some on the ACT website, and then I got a friend to let me copy his book an answers from a few previous dates.  Also i found this book on ebay.\n\nGetting into the Act by Act (1997)\n\n\nAnd finally i got the big blue SAT book.  That was the most help.\n\nSo i had about 11 official ACT tests and practices after my search\n\n3 practice:Red Book\n1 2005-2006 ACT practice\n1 2006-2007 ACT practice\n1 2007-2008 ACT practice\n1 June 2007 ACT TEST\n1 April 2007 ACT TEST\n3 practice:  blue/white ACT book from 1997.\n--\n11 total\nHere is my secret to what i did.\n\nI went through ONLY the Math and English parts of the official practice tests.  I heard these were the easiest areas to improve on so i attacked those first.\n\nFor 11 days, I did the math and english parts of all the tests.  This was around mid july 07.\n\nThe most important aspect of taking those tests was not the actual taking them.  It was why I got problems wrong.   I would spend hours trying to figure out why i got some certain english and math problems wrong.  It was like my brain was trying to tackle a grizzly bear.  It made my head hurt literally. All i would see was english and math in my dreams.\n*To do well you must understand the principle behind the problems**\n\n*Do not ever write in the ACT practice books**\n\nAfter i took the first ACT practice test,  i stored it away intact. I would do the test in time,  but if i came upon a math problem that i did not understand,  I would stop the timer and try to figure it out, no matter what. My math and english scores went up about 2 points each after taking the first initial practice test.   All my work was done on a white sheet of computer paper, where i numberd it myself and kept it in a neat order.  These answer sheets were essential in getting my score up.\n\nThen I took the second practice test.  I noticed that my scores went up about 1 point in each subject from the first practice test.  On my answer sheet i circled all the numbers that i got wrong and stored it away carefully.\n\nNaturally after going through the practice tests and circluing on my answer page the ones i got wrong(NOT IN THE BOOK!!!!!)   my scores raised to about a 29 in math and a 27 in english.  Those were pretty good for me, but i wanted higher.    This is where my old answer sheets came in.\n\n\nI would cross reference different ACT tests on the questions i missed to see if i were missing a princple.  And sure enough I was missing them all over the place in english. I missed things like where to put commas and what is rhetorically correct.  This did not take much time to do, because there arent that many principles on the tests.\n\nThe same thing happend for math.  I would realize i would miss most of the last 10-12 problems.  I knew how to do most of them, but i always fell for the tricks.  To get my mind to recoginize tricks i turned to the Big BLUE official SAT book.\n\nThere i did all the math practice tests. I did 1 aobut every 2 days becuase i was tired of studying.  I would notice that these questions were tricky from the beggining.  And the last ones were really tough.  It took my mind a while sometimes to figure out why i was missing them.  I had done the math section of that book the same way i did the ACT: did not write in it, but wrote and kept on the answer sheet.  The SAT math tests got easier and easier.\n\n\nThen i lied dormant from about Septemeber to May with no studyign at all.\n\nI had the june 08 ACT coming up, I knew i had to get back in shape. I started in mid may.\n\nI pulled out my 11 practice tests(they were not written on, off course).\n\nI worked the math and english portions again, and the results were pretty good.  My brain  knew what to look out for in Math and English.  After doing the first practice test, i got the score of 30 and 30 each.  I went back to my old answer sheets to see if i missed any of the same questions, and if I did, pay extra time studyign that problem.  As i went through the practice tests, my scores went constintly higher in Math and English.  They ranged from a 30-36 in english, to a 29-31 in Math.  Those last 10 were the bane of my existance. I would miss less of them, but still i would miss at least 5 or 6 of them.  I still had 2 practice tests that I had not reworked.\n\nThen i went back to the faithful SAT book.  I reworked not all, but alot of the harder problems from that book in MATH.   Then i went back  to those 2 practice tests that i had not reworked.  The results were astounding.  I got a 35 and a 34 on the math sections.  My brain had finally evolved and adapted to take on hard math problems.  It had a much easier time with english.\n\nCome ACT day, i thought the math and english were a breeze.  35 on both.   As for reading and science,  ill post my stratagy another time on those.  Those were completely different animals that i have yet to fully tame.

We are not required to look beneath the surface or to question how something seems. In fact, we are urged to trust our impressions, often our first impressions, of how a person or a situation seems to be. Yet appearances can be misleading. What \"seems\" isn't always what is.\n\n\nAssignment: Is the way something seems to be not always the same as it actually is?\n\n\nThe way something seems is not always the same as it actually is. As far as we know, the world is made up of complexity and diversity; nothing has only one facet, and the theory is also applicable to people. Our experience proves that our impression about people can be rather unreliable. As a result, we would better examine objects and people by studying their substantial qualities rather than misleading appearances.\n\n\nIn history, there are countless well-known figures who share unsurpassable fame, but fail to construct their frames to cater to their adherents imagination. Let us take Mozart into consideration. This transcendent musician is widely considered as a genius in music history, in which he inscribed his name with his extraodinary talents and prolificacy of compositions. People who give admiration to this outstanding musician built a sublime statue in his hometown. However, the statue, though reflects Mozart's passion with its vivacious facial expression, can hardly be recognized by thoes who are familiar with Mozart. In reality, Mozart is far from a handsome and robust young man, as the way the statue was produced, but actually his appearance can be described as \"tough\". With his unkempt hair and poor health condition, the great musician's appearance can never meet his talents. But people have learnt not to judge the genius by the impression he left us, but by his unsurmountable aptitude and precious qualities. So, people's intrinsic qualities do not always equal their appearances.\n\n\nMoreover, the reliability of impression is also lessened by literary works. One illustrational work is Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde by Louis Stevenson. In the fiction , Dr. Jekyll is reverently regarded as a friendly and kind intelligentsia , but another character in him is both sinister and sadistic. Though it seems nothing is shared in common by the two totally different men, both of them are parts of Jekyll or Hyde. The story tells a tacit theory that every man's characteristics are complicated. To know people's true self-being from the appearances is misleading.\n\nConclusively, though we prefer to make a judgement by setting our impression as the criterion, reality contradicts our universal belief that the way something seems is always the same as it actually is.

What are the benefits and drawbacks of not having the distribution requirements that are found at most other colleges?*\nI think the Brown Curriculum is fantastic. The lack of distribution requirements, along with a pervasive culture which supports personal responsibility and individualized learning, completely changes what a Brown student experiences. Competition amongst students is lowered dramatically because its rare that two students have similar schedules or similar motivations.\nI have the ability to organize my education in a way that is coherent for my own goals. For example, I've taken courses which were actually anthropology, history, sociology, archeology, a language which all fell under the same undergraduate program-- Judaic studies. While at many institutions taking so many courses outside of my concentration would have been looked at as narrowing my studies, I was able to construct a liberal education which allowed me to explore several disciplines organized topically around a personal interest. That experience may not be appreciated elsewhere.\nThe navigation and creation of an individualized curriculum has also been essential to my own intellectual growth. I had no interest in or real understanding of the concept of a liberal arts education when I came to Brown. The Open Curriculum was just an appealing way to lower red tape and allow me to explore the many interests I had. However, now, at Brown, being responsible for my own curricular path has forced me to engage my education. I am far more active participant in defining what it means to be educated than I ever would have been at another school. While I do not object to the notion that a college education requires exploration outside of one's comfort zone and should involve various subject areas, had I simply been given a prescription for my education at the start of my first-year I would have viewed general education has a meaningless checklist. Now I've been forced to consider what my education means, how my courses connected, how it is, in fact, that my stumbling through courses based on my personal interest that I managed to construct a strong liberal arts education.\nThe weakness, if any, is that the Brown common experience is a lack of common experience. Many students at other universities will often claim that they come together as members of a community around their common general education \"experience\" (I often think \"experience\" in this case is a euphemism for \"woes\"). Here at Brown the culture is unified around the actions we take out of the classroom. The result is something that is quite powerful-- educational experiences outside of the classroom are often at the forefront of a Brown student's experience rather than the background. However, this results in a more fractured student body where groups are often smaller and fractured more purely along the lines of extracurricular interests. We don't lose any of our love for Brown, and we certainly love to talk about shopping period and course selection with any of our peers, but the lack of a consistent core does create for a weakening of institutional memory because alumni had remarkably different experiences than current students. In fact, many current students have remarkably different experiences from their peers. I don't think the result is a lack of unity, but rather, a very different kind of unity on campus that's far harder to capture and define.\n\n\n*What role has advising played in your academic experience so far? Do you think the task force\u0092s updated advising recommendations will have a significant effect on students?*\nMy advising experience has been excellent. I sought out advisors as mentors, not information caches. I have found that both of the advisors I've had formally, professors I've met with informally, deans, and the Career Development Center have all been incredibly helpful. Each of these groups were willing to meet with me and talk about where I saw myself going over the next few years, discuss why I was taking the classes I was taking, and help me with some internal struggles I dealt with at Brown. I think that students are largely seeking out mentors more than advisors and I've been able to find quite a few faculty members on campus who were willing to act in that role.\nI hope that the Task Force recommendations for advising will begin to shift the culture of advising in the right direction. The Open Curriculum requires particular attention to advising. A sm\u00f6rg\u00e5sbord goes from an exciting experience to a very unpleasant one if a diner is not judicious and wise in their choices. The Open Curriculum can become overwhelming and uncomfortable in much the same way if a student is not prepared with the tools to make strong, informed choices. Advising at Brown is rarely a single relationship-- it's a cohort between students, faculty, and staff. Effectively coordinating a huge number of sometimes seemingly disparate resources is critical to ensuring these cohorts are strong for all students. I think that the Task Force sought to create more points of contact between students and resources here on campus. The new Faculty Advising Fellows seek to place particularly strong advisors closer to students. Many students take part in our Faculty in Residence program already, so having an Advising Fellow on hand is a huge resource to students not comfortable with their assigned advisor or students seeking a different opinion. A Science Resource Center which can provide students with a single place to stop for basic advise on structural information at Brown will bridge a huge gap in institutional knowledge.\nI think the difficult part of Brown is that there are so many opportunities and so many different paths to take that no one person can really be an expert on all things Brown. Students who think that any advisor can possibly have all of the answers are setting themselves up for failure. Luckily, our online resources have been greatly expanded and are rather comprehensive, but brining this information closer to the hands of students, easier, will lead to more widespread success navigating Brown. It's difficult for me to assess advising, because my experience has been largely positive. I came to Brown to be independent and responsible and seek out what I wanted to take advantage of and I've always viewed my advising cohorts as a set of people whose opinion I respect and whose life experiences can inform my choices. In that role, advising at Brown I think is almost universally successful for all students by the time they graduate (though not always as early in the Brown experience as is ideal). However, we can do better communicating logistical information that's powerful for navigating thousands of courses, study abroad experiences, research experiences, extracurricular activities, internships, career prospects, graduate school, etc.                "}, {"date": "2008-11-23T07:38:55+00:00", "url": "http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/university-california-berkeley/602520-must-read-berkeley-admissions-including-regents-chancellors-scholarship.html", "messages": "\n                    Note: I first typed part of this up as a response to another thread, but it grew very very lengthy so I decided to make a separate thread. This answers many commonly asked questions about Berkeley and its admissions process. I personally feel that this is good enough to be stickied, but as it's not really my decision...\n\nHere goes:\n\nThese are roughly the sections in this very lengthy post. If you don't want to read the entire thing, hit Cltr+F (Find), and copy in one of these section titles. Click \"Find Next\" until you have reached desired section.\n\nSection A: Berkeley Admissions: A Holistic System\nSection B: Race in Admissions\nSection C: The Berkeley Application (including ELC)\nSection D: Secondary Application\nSection E: The Regents' and Chancellor's Scholarship\nSection F: Your Day of Reckoning (also known as the day admissions results are released)\n\n\nSection A: Berkeley Admissions: A Holistic System\n\nIt's been stated by admission committee (henceforth referred to as \"adcom\") members that for the UC system, all schools UCSD and \"below\" use a pure number based formula. It's something like your GPA * 1000 + SAT scores + points for extracurriculars and stuff like that. If your point total breaks a certain threshold, you are admitted. I believe you can even check your score for some schools (Davis, San Diego? etc.).\n\nUC Berkeley and UCLA use a holistic approach. That is, they look at all aspects of your application. This is similar to what Ivy and Ivy-like schools use.\n\nWhat this means is that there is no guaranteed way to get into any of these schools, UC Berkeley included. Having stellar test-scores may greatly increase your chances of admission, but they are by no means a guarantee. There are some here who seemingly got in purely based on numbers, and others who got in seemingly due to other factors (there is one person in my dorm who got below 1000 on her SAT, including a 200 on the critical reading section; 2400 point scale. She is not a recruited athlete.).\n\nHow does this factor into your college application strategy? If you're younger than a high school senior, don't stress out. Build your profile. Do well on the SAT's, but don't stress out if you don't break 2200. Maintain a strong GPA. The average SAT score for Berkeley's class of 2008 is a 2035; the average (UC) GPA a 4.18 (UC GPA: calculate as weighted, but only count honors/AP extra point for 8 semesters of honors/AP classes. The rest count as normal classes.) At the same time, don't just study, get out and do stuff. Extracurriculars are important. Show that you care about your school, your community, your world.\n\nIf you're a high school senior, read section C.\n\n\nSection B: Ethnicity in Admissions\n\nRace/ethnicity does not play as large a role as you would think. Affirmative action quotas have been outlawed for admissions in California (I'm 100% this applies to UC's; I'm not quite sure about privates). What this means: your being Inuit or Native American will not guarantee your admission into UC Berkeley. Your being Asian American will not guarantee your rejection from UC Berkeley. Adcom will consider race as one of many factors, but it will not make/break your application. Race will effectively only play a role if you are one of the few hundred people that are on the line between acceptance and rejection. For the other ~50000 people that apply, your race should not affect your application.\n\n\nSection C: The Berkeley Application (including ELC)\n\nSo now you're a high school senior, and you're applying to UC Berkeley. What now? Go to the UC application website. Create a new profile/application. Except if you're ELC. More on that later. Enter all your information. Don't leave out anything, in the hopes that it will improve your chances for admission, as if they discover deceit later, they'll kick you out anyways/take away your degree/etc. Fill out your classes, grades, all that fun stuff. Choose what you believe are your defining and most important extracurricular activities and awards. Yes, choose. Don't cram 294823084238 in when there are only a limited number of spaces.\n\nI'm putting this on a separate line because it gets asked about so much: You do not need to send in your transcript or letters of recommendations. Let me repeat that: YOU DO NOT NEED TO SEND IN YOUR TRANSCRIPT OR LETTERS OF RECOMMENDATION. Yet. Don't worry about transcripts until you get in, and don't worry about letters of recommendations unless they are specifically requested from you (this will not apply to most applicants). They won't read them; they'll probably just end up in the recycle bin.\n\nChoose your major from the very very long list provided. Sorry, no second majors. If you're applying to the College of Letters and Science, it doesn't matter too much what you choose, as until you fulfill your lower division requirements and actually declare a major, you'll forever be known as \"Intended blahblahblah major\". If you're applying anywhere else, choose carefully. Some majors (such as EECS) admit to that major. As in, if you apply as EECS, you will be EECS. If you don't know what you want to do, apply undeclared. There's nothing wrong with it.\n\nGo ahead and figure out which other campuses you want to apply to (but really, where else would you go besides Berkeley?). Just remember that you'll be paying the application fee * the # of schools you're applying to.\n\nIf you're reading this, you're probably a high school senior, stressing about college apps. Don't. Seriously, it doesn't do you any good. At this point, your profile has pretty much solidified; you're not going to magically raise your GPA to a 5.0, or discover a cure for the common cold (not that either of those are required to get in, but just in case...). What you can do: work on those essays. Make them stellar. Make them outstanding. Make sure that if your essay is in a pile with 50 others, and I read all of them, the only one I remember at the end of the day is yours. Ask for input. Have your teachers, your counselors, and even that piano teacher that's taught you for over a decade read your essays. Listen to what they have to say. But also remember: this is your essay. Listen, but also weed out what you believe is detrimental from your essay from what is constructive. The UC app asks for a total of 1000 words. This can be split however you feel would best represent you, but keep in mind that a 950/50 split probably won't sit too well with adcom. You can go slightly over, but the general rule is that you generally try to avoid going 5% over, and definitely do not go 10% over the word count limit.\n\nYou can also provide extra information if you so choose. This is NOT the place to stick the rest of your lengthy resume. This is NOT a place to submit a third long essay. This is the place for things like explaining extenuating circumstances that led to your GPA dip in junior year, or why your English grades are relatively weak (e.g. learning English as a second language). Don't give adcom extra stuff, you might end up annoying them (they DO have ~50000 other applications to read...), and it's never good to annoy someone who's deciding your fate.\n\nAbout this whole ELC business: If you are ELC, aka eligible in local context, good job. That means your uncapped, weighted GPA is one of the highest at your school (top 4%), assuming your school is in California. To show how special you are, the UC system will give you a special application that has like 5 boxes filled out already. You'll receive application information in the mail (namely: login info and PIN. Your login name will probably be something like lastnamefirstname000.). If you don't get some part, but your school confirms that you are indeed ELC, call UC. They'll give you your info so that you can start your application.\n\nHow big of a deal is ELC? Apparently, it's pretty big. ELC effectively gives you guaranteed admission to several UC campuses (e.g. Davis, Riverside, etc.). That may not seem very appealing to a bright scholar such as yourself, but also consider this: Berkeley's admit rate last year was 21.4%, while the ELC admit rate was 56.2%. UCLA's numbers were comparable, at 22.7% and 60.6% respectively. If you get ELC, use your ELC app, even if you're halfway through another app. Your ELC app tells Berkeley that you were one of the top students at your high school, which is never a bad thing.\n\n\nSection D: Secondary Application\n\nA few applicants will receive a request for more information (effectively a secondary application). Why? After receiving the many, many applications from prospective and hopeful young scholars, adcom is usually able to quickly sort out the applicant pool into two groups: very very likely acceptance, and very very likely rejection. However, there are always those applications that cannot easily be classified, and fall into the metaphorical purgatory. To help their decision making, adcom sends out a request for more information from these applicants. If you do receive such a request, it is 99% of the time in your best interest to fill this out. If you do receive such a request, you are a borderline applicant. You have not been rejected; you have not been accepted. However, if you don't fill out the secondary application, it's probably fairly easy to conclude that you will be rejected.\n\n\nSection E: The Regents' and Chancellor's Scholarship\n\nThis is billed as the most prestigious scholarship you can receive as an undergraduate at Berkeley, with good reason. On a campus of ~25000 undergraduates, there are roughly 1000 Regents' and Chancellor's Scholars (~200 per class, with the remaining 200 composed of Junior College transfers and a handful of 5th/6th year seniors). Benefits include money (an honorarium, plus whatever you need. Basically, if you were getting loans from financial aid, this scholarship replaces that with...money. People can and do get full rides.), a personal faculty adviser, membership in RCSA, as well as much more. \"So how do I get this wonderful award?\" you ask. Well, it's quite simple. Write some killer essays. When adcom is reading applications, they're going to award this scholarship to select individuals (not just any). I roughly quote from memory: \"When we selected you scholars, we were recognizing what you had done in high school. But his scholarship is not just a recognition of what you have done in the past, it is a sign of potential. Some faculty member read your application and saw that you had the potential to do great things. You are the scholars, the cream of the crop, that have the potential to change and improve this university, and this world.\"\n\nYou do need to fill out a separate application form. When adcom is reviewing your application to Berkeley, they will set aside a few (~2000, I believe) applications. These applicants will be notified in February (last year: 2/14) by the Undergraduate Scholarships, Prizes, and Honors office via email and physical mail of their candidacy for the Regents' and Chancellor's Scholarship. If you receive this notification, congratulations! You have been admitted to UC Berkeley (and what's more, you've found out over a month before anyone else knows their admissions decision). No, you won't get the official welcome letter that everyone else gets (yet). Just revel in your joy alone (or with anyone else you know who's also a Regents' and Chancellor's Scholarship candidate) for now.\n\nApplicants from Northern California will be invited to the UC Berkeley campus, where they will be interviewed by a faculty member affiliated with the scholarship program and association. Applicants from Southern California will be invited to a TBD location for their interview (last year, I believe it was a hotel in Los Angeles). If you are invited for interview, RSVP FAST. All slots should be weekdays, so plan accordingly; if you RSVP later, you may have to make adjustments to your usual schedule (read: skip school on the day of a major test or other important event) to attend the interview. You will have the opportunity to bring along letters of recommendation to your interview. While there, you will be able to meet current Regents' and Chancellor's Scholars, faculty members, and other people connected to Berkeley. If you're at the Berkeley campus, you will also be fed very very good food (not sure about Southern California, as I was not down there).\n\nIf you so choose, you can also attend OHP, an Overnight Host Program hosted by RCSA, the Regents' and Chancellor's Scholars Association (a mouthful; just call it RCSA ^^). If you have the time, OHP is an excellent way to experience the culture and environment of Berkeley. If you don't have time, you can also attend OHP before Cal Day (which this year is Saturday, April 18). Note: RCSA OHP is far better and cheaper than the OHP and OSP run by the university and/or alumni association. I believe the university run OHP was ~$90 last year, where as the RCSA one has been free most years; I believe it was ~$10 last year.\n\nOkay, now you've applied. When do you find out? You'll know the day admissions decisions for everyone else are released. See? Even though you know you're in, they've still managed to create suspense for admissions release day.\n\nIf you are an out-of-state applicant or international applicant, you do not need to interview for the scholarship. If you are notified that you have received it, then...you've got it.\n\n\nSection F: Your Day of Reckoning (also known as the day admissions results are released)\n\nAs the end of March draws near, inevitably, people will begin to ask: WHEN WILL THEY RELEASE ADMISSIONS INFO? Please don't ask people here, if you don't know, they don't know. Berkeley will tell you. They will email you. Don't ask. We don't know. Until you do. In which case you didn't need to ask us in the first place.\n\nAlso, please don't overanalyze simple word differences in emails Berkeley sends out (those who were part of the epically long thread last year will know exactly what I'm talking about). Well, you can. It provides some amusement for the admissions committee.\n\nWell, it's THE DAY. When you log into myBerkeleyApp, you'll see...your result. If you're in, you'll see your beautiful welcome letter. Yay! You've done it. Pat yourself on the back. Keep going in. In your checklist, if you were an applicant for the Regents' and Chancellor's Scholarship, you'll see something along the lines of \"Congratulations! You have been awarded the UC Berkeley Regents' and Chancellor's Scholarship. Details are being sent via email and the U.S. mail.\" If you see this, pat yourself on the back again. Go celebrate =)\n\nSo you're done celebrating. Back to business. Do everything the checklist tells you to do. It's a checklist for a reason; it is incredibly useful. Explore myBerkeleyApp. Explore Berkeley's website. Explore your department's website.\n\nSubmit your SIR at least a few days early, as you need to do that to submit your SLR (Statement of Legal Residence), and these things take time. Basically, if you don't submit your SLR, the most mild of the many things that could happen to you is that you'll be forced to pay out of state fees. When it's time, apply for housing. If you want to room with your friend, get his/her student ID, and put it into your application in the appropriate section (and have him/her do the same). Go to Cal Day. Later, sign up for Calso. Early Calso is good; you'll sign up for classes at Calso and certain classes will fill up. Then go read the second part of http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/university-california-berkeley/26518-getting-into-cal-what-expect-when-you-finally-get-there.html; There's a lot of useful info in there.\n\nHope this helps.

I now know why you're so happy I'm here -- (laughter -- all classes were cancelled. (Applause.)\n\nI had the honor of sitting next to the General and Judy during the game over the weekend. I am disappointed I could not bring the Commander-in-Chief's Trophy with me. However, you just get the Commander-in-Chief. (Applause.)\n\nThis is my last visit to a military academy as President, so I thought I would exercise a certain prerogative of office one last time: I hereby absolve all cadets who are on restriction for minor conduct offenses. As always, I always -- I leave it to General Hagenbeck to determine what \"minor\" means. (Laughter.)\n\nI really am proud to be with you today.

It's my honor to let them fly on the \"big bird.\" (Laughter.)\n\nThere are many honors that come with the presidency, but none higher than serving as Commander-in-Chief in the greatest Armed Forces on Earth. (Applause.) Every one of you is a volunteer. You came to this academy in a time of war, knowing all the risks that come with military service. I want to thank you for making the noble and selfless decision to serve our country. And I will always be grateful to the men and women who wear the uniform of the United States military.\n\nAs West Point cadets, you're part of a generation that has witnessed extraordinary change in the world. Two decades ago, the Cold War was nearing its end, and the Soviet Union was about to collapse. You were just beginning your lives. About the same time, another threat was quietly gathering. In hidden corners of the world, violent religious extremists were plotting ways to advance their radical aims and their grim ideology. We saw the results in a series of horrifying blows -- the truck bombing of the World Trade Center, the attack of Khobar Towers, the bombing of our embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, and the strike on the USS Cole.\n\nFor many years, America treated these attacks as isolated incidents -- and responded with limited measures. And then came September the 11th, 2001. In the space of a single morning we realized that we were facing a worldwide movement of fanatics pledged to our destruction. We saw that conditions of repression and despair on the other side of the world could bring suffering and death to our own streets.\n\nAs a result, America reshaped our approach to national security. Here at home, we hardened our defenses and created the Department of Homeland Security. We gave our national security professionals vital new tools like the Patriot Act and the ability to monitor terrorist communications. We reorganized our intelligence community to better meet the needs of war against these terrorists, including increasing the number of intelligence officers. We deployed aggressive financial measures to freeze their assets and to cut off their money. We launched diplomatic initiatives to pressure our adversaries and attract new partners to our cause.\n\nWe also made dramatic changes to both our military strategy and our -- the military itself. We resolved that we would not wait to be attacked again, and so we went on the offense against the terrorists overseas so we never had to face them here at home. We recognized that we needed strong partners at our side, so we helped strengthen the counterterrorism capabilities of our allies. We understood, as I said here at West Point in 2002, \"if we wait for threats to fully materialize, we will have waited too long\" -- so we made clear that hostile regimes sponsoring terror or pursuing weapons of mass destruction would be held to account.\n\nWe concluded that we are engaged in an ideological struggle, so we launched an effort to discredit the hateful vision of the extremists and advance the hopeful alternative of freedom. We saw the urgency of staying a step ahead of our enemies, so we transformed our military both to prevail on the battlefields of today and to meet the threats of tomorrow.\n\nThese changes will have a direct impact on your military careers. This morning, I'm going to give you a report on where we stand in each of these areas, and the challenges that lie ahead.\n\nFirst, within weeks of September the 11th, our Armed Forces began taking the fight to the terrorists around the world -- and we have not stopped. From the Horn of Africa to the islands of Southeast Asia to wherever these thugs hide, we and our allies applied the full range of military and intelligence assets to keep unrelenting pressure on al Qaeda and its affiliates. We have severely weakened the terrorists. We've disrupted plots to attack our homeland. We have captured or killed hundreds of al Qaeda leaders and operatives in more than two dozen countries -- including the man who mastermind the 9/11 attacks, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed.\n\nThe terrorists continue to pose serious challenges, as the world saw in the terrible attack in Mumbai last month. Al Qaeda's top two leaders remain at large. Yet they are facing pressure so intense that the only way they can stay alive is to stay underground. The day will come, the day will come when they receive the justice they deserve. (Applause.)\n\nSecond, we've helped key partners and allies strengthen their capabilities in the fight against the terrorists. We've increased intelligence-sharing with friends and allies around the world. We've provided training and support to counterterrorism partners like the Philippines, and Indonesia, and Jordan, and Saudi Arabia. These partners have made enormous contributions in the war on terror. For example, Indonesia has crippled the terrorist group JI. Saudi Arabia has killed or captured hundreds of al Qaeda terrorists. And in Europe, security services have broken up terrorist cells in Germany, in Denmark, in Turkey, and the United Kingdom.\n\nOne of the most important challenges we will face, and you will face, in the years ahead is helping our partners assert control over ungoverned spaces. This problem is most pronounced in Pakistan, where areas along the Afghanistan border are home to Taliban and to al Qaeda fighters. The Pakistani government and people understand the threat, because they have been victims of terror themselves. They're working to enforce the law and fight terror in the border areas. And our government is providing strong support for these efforts. And at the same time, we have made it clear to Pakistan -- and to all our partners -- that we will do what is necessary to protect American troops and the American people.\n\nThird, we have made clear that governments that sponsor terror are as guilty as the terrorists -- and will be held to account. After 9/11, we applied the doctrine to Afghanistan. We removed the Taliban from power. We shut down training camps where al Qaeda planned the attacks on our country. We liberated more than 25 million Afghans. Now America and our 25 NATO allies and 17 partner nations are standing with the Afghan people as they defend their free society. The enemy is determined, the terrain is harsh, and the battle is difficult. But our coalition will stay in this fight. We will not let the Taliban or al Qaeda return to power. And Afghanistan will never again be a safe haven for terrorists. (Applause.)\n\nWe also took a hard look at the danger posed by Iraq -- a country that combined support for terror, the development and the use of weapons of mass destruction, violence against its own people, aggression against its neighbors, hostility to the United States, and systematic violation of United Nations resolutions. After seeing the destruction of September the 11th, we concluded that America could not afford to allow a regime with such a threatening and violent record to remain in the heart of the Middle East. So we offered Saddam Hussein a final chance to peacefully resolve the issue. And when he refused, we acted with a coalition of nations to protect our people -- and liberated 25 million Iraqis.\n\nThe battle in Iraq has been longer and more difficult than expected. Foreign terrorists, former regime elements, and Iraqi insurgents -- often with outside support -- combined to drive up violence, and bring the country to the verge of chaos. So we adopted a new strategy, and rather than retreating, sent more troops into Baghdad in Iraq. And when the surge met its objective, we began to bring our troops home under a policy of return on success. Last week, Iraq approved two agreements that formalize diplomatic and economic and security ties with America -- and set a framework for the drawdown of American forces as the fight in Iraq nears a successful end.\n\nFourth, America recognized the only way to defeat the terrorists in the long run is to present an alternative to their hateful ideology. So when we overthrew the dictators in Afghanistan and Iraq, we refused to take the easy option and instill friendly strongmen in their place. Instead, we're doing the tough work of helping democratic societies emerge as examples for people all across the Middle East. We're pressing nations around the world -- including our friends -- to trust their people with greater freedom of speech, and worship, and assembly. We're advancing a broader vision of reform that includes economic prosperity, and quality health care and education, and vibrant civil societies, and women's rights.\n\nThe results of these efforts are unfolding slowly and unevenly, but there are encouraging signs. From Iraq and Afghanistan to Lebanon and Pakistan, voters defied the terrorists to cast their ballots in free elections. In places like Iraq's Anbar province, people have seen what life under the Taliban looks like -- and they decided they want no part it -- actually, it was life under al Qaeda looks like.\n\nYou know, mothers don't want to raise their child in a neighborhood where thugs run and where thugs brutalize people. People want to live in peace. People want to live in freedom. Muslims from Jordan and Turkey to India and Indonesia have seen their brothers and sisters massacred, and recoiled from the terrorists. And even within the jihadist ranks, religious scholars have begun to criticize al Qaeda and its brutal tactics. In these ideological rejections, we see the beginning of al Qaeda's ultimate demise -- because in the long run, the ideology of hatred and fear cannot possibly compete with the power of hope and freedom. (Applause.)\n\nFinally, we are transforming our military for a new kind of war that we're fighting now, and for wars of tomorrow. This transformation was a top priority for the enterprising leader who served as my first Secretary of Defense -- Donald Rumsfeld. Today, because of his leadership and the leadership of Secretary Bob Gates, we have made our military better trained, better equipped, and better prepared to meet the threats facing America today, and tomorrow, and long in the future.\n\nAs part of our transformation effort, we are arming our troops with intelligence, and weapons, and training, and support they need to face an enemy that wages asymmetric battle. See, this enemy hides among the civilian population, and they use terror tactics like roadside bombs to attack our forces, to demoralize local population, and to try to shake the will of the American people.\n\nTo defeat this enemy, we have equipped our troops with real-time battlefield intelligence capabilities that would have been unimaginable just a few years ago. In Iraq and Afghanistan, troops in the field have used advanced technologies like Global Positioning Systems to direct air strikes that take out the enemy while sparing innocent life. We've expanded America's arsenal of unmanned aerial vehicles from fewer than 170 when I took office to more than 6,000 today. We're arming Predator drones. We're using them to stay on the hunt against the terrorists who would do us harm.\n\nWe've expanded America's special operations forces. With more forces -- more of these forces on the battlefield, we can respond more quickly to actionable intelligence on the terrorists who are in hiding. Over the past eight years, we have more than doubled funding for special operators. We created the first-ever special operations command within the Marines. We have given the Special Operations Command the lead role in the global war against the terrorists.\n\nIn addition to these upgrades in our counterterrorism capabilities, we have placed a new focus on counterinsurgency. The Army has published a new counterinsurgency manual written by a distinguished graduate of this academy: General David Petraeus. The central objectives of this counterinsurgency strategy are to secure the population, and gain support of the people, and train local forces to take the responsibility on their own.\n\nOne of the reasons we're meeting these objectives in Iraq is the ability to rapidly deploy brigade combat teams. These teams can join the battle on short notice as organized and cohesive units. With these teams in the fight, our Army is better able to carry out its counterinsurgency objectives -- and better equipped to defeat the enemies we'll face as the 21st century unfolds.\n\nOur counterinsurgency strategy also stresses the importance of following up security gains with real benefits in people's daily lives. To better meet that objective, we created Provincial Reconstruction Teams, or PRTs. These teams pair with military personnel civilian experts in areas like economics, and agriculture, and law enforcement, and education. In both Iraq and Afghanistan, these teams are helping local communities create jobs, and deliver basic services, and keep the terrorists from coming back. PRTs bring diplomats, aid workers, and other experts from across the government into the fight -- and we must expand them in the years to come.\n\nTo better institutionalize all the changes we've made in recent years, we have transformed the education and training our troops receive. We're taking the lessons we've learned in Afghanistan and Iraq, and teaching them at military academies and training centers across our country. For example, every branch of the military now receives the counterinsurgency training that was once reserved for special operations forces. Here at West Point, you've created a new Combating Terrorism Center that allows you to gain insights from the battles of today and apply them as you lead our military into the future.\n\nIn addition to making these changes to help our troops prevail in the war on terror, we've been transforming our military since early 2001 to confront other challenges that may emerge in the decades ahead. For example, we have begun the most sweeping transformation of America's global force posture since the end of World War II. We're shifting troops from Cold War garrisons in Europe and Asia so they can surge more rapidly to troubled spots around the world. We've established new military commands to meet challenges unique to Africa and to support our homeland.\n\nWe've invested more than a half a trillion dollars in research and development, so we can build even more advanced capabilities to protect America from the dangers of a new century. We're making our forces more joint and interoperable, so they can cooperate seamlessly across different services and with foreign partners. And to confront an emerging threat to our economy, our defense systems, and individual citizens, the federal government is cooperating closely with the private sector to improve security in cyberspace.\n\nOne of the most serious dangers facing our people is the threat of a rogue regime armed with ballistic missiles. In 2001, I announced withdrawal from the ABM Treaty. I did so because it constrained our ability to develop the technologies needed to defend ourselves against the threat of blackmail by rogue states. With these constraints removed, we have developed and deployed new defenses capable of protecting American cities from ballistic missile attack.\n\nThis system can now defend America against limited missile attacks from Northeast Asia. Concluded agreements with Poland and the Czech Republic to establish missile defense sites on their territories to help protect against ballistic missile attacks from the Middle East. Because we acted, America now has an initial capability to protect our people from a ballistic missile attack.\n\nAs we built new defenses against a missile attack, we also worked with Russia to make historic reductions in offensive nuclear weapons. When these reductions are complete, the total U.S. nuclear stockpile will be at its lowest level since the Eisenhower administration. These reductions are part of a new approach to strategic deterrence that relies on both nuclear and conventional strike forces, as well as strong defenses. We're investing in new technologies that will ensure the long-term safety and security and reliability and effectiveness of our nuclear deterrent. This approach sends a clear message to the world: We'll reduce our reliance on nuclear weapons while keeping America's strategic deterrent unchallenged.\n\nWith all the actions we've taken these past eight years, we've laid a solid foundation on which future Presidents and future military leaders can build. America's military -- America's military today is stronger, more agile, and better prepared to confront threats to our people than it was eight years ago. In the years ahead, our nation must continue developing the capabilities to take the fight to our enemies across the world. We must stay on the offensive. We must be determined and we must be relentless to do our duty to protect the American people from harm. (Applause.)\n\nWe must stand by the friends and allies who are making tough decisions and taking risks to defeat the terrorists. We must keep up the pressure on regimes that sponsor terror and pursue weapons of mass destruction. We must continue to support dissidents and reformers who are speaking out against extremism and in favor of liberty. We must continue transforming our Armed Forces so that the next generation inherits a military that is capable of keeping the American people safe and advancing the cause of peace. And above all, we must always ensure that our troops have the funds and resources they need to do their jobs, and that their families receive the full support they deserve. (Applause.)\n\nI have great confidence in the future, because I have confidence in you all. Ultimately, the security of our nation depends on the courage of those who wear the uniform. I see that courage in all of you. I thank you for your patriotism. I thank you for your devotion to duty. May God bless you in all your endeavors. May God bless your families. And may God continue to bless the United States of America. (Applause.)

Comments are welcome.\n\nPart 1\n\nJust a preface: read the whole thing \u0096 I\u0092m not organized enough to manage to fit in all the \u0091bigger\u0092 reasons at the top of the essay, and the insignificant ones at the end Also, I\u0092ll try not to make this sound like a bashing thread, but I might focus on why not to choose Harvard over why to choose Yale, just \u0091cause the \u0093why Yale\u0094 topic has been covered pretty extensively on these boards. Finally, most of the reasons Yale rocks Harvard are just totally not quantifiable\u0085 you\u0092ve really just got to be here (and talk to students at Harvard who have visited friends at Yale) to see it.\n\nREPUTATION\nSo, Harvard has the bigger name. Sort of. Well, at least among people who don\u0092t matter. Any grad school/professional school admissions committee, or potential employer is knows that the academic caliber of Harvard and Yale (and several other schools) as institutions and as student bodies are identical.\nThe better point to make in the reputation section is \u0093so what?\u0094 I already avoid telling people where I go to school (the answer is always \u0093back East\u0094 or \u0093Ezra Stiles College\u0094). I always feel like I\u0092m boasting when I say I go to Yale, especially when talking to people who didn\u0092t go to college, or know nothing about Yale other than the fact that it\u0092s an Ivy. I\u0092m not trying to impress anyone, and I hate the \u0093Wow, Yale! You must be smart!\u0094 reaction. With Harvard, it would just be worse, if we\u0092re sticking with the Harvard-has-the-bigger-name point of view. Plus, I feel like many people choose Harvard over other schools because it\u0092s Harvard. How could you resist, right? (Oh, the na\u00efve masses). I didn\u0092t want to be with those whom I not-so-affectionately term \u0091prestige-whores,\u0092 or with people whose parents/family pressured them into going to Harvard. We\u0092re big kids now; we can make our own decision.\n\nSCHEDULING\nYale\u0092s academic calendar rocks. I think this fall classes are starting September 6, and this year I\u0092m done with finals on May 2. That\u0092s over four months of summer break (Harvard gets something very similar, just pushed back one month). Plus, we got 9 days for Thanksgiving (Harvard gets a Thursday/Friday long weekend), 23 days minimum for Winter Break (Harvard got 13 days this year), and two weeks off for Spring Break (Harvard got one). I say 23 days minimum for Winter Break because most people\u0092s finals end before the last day of finals week. Many people have up to a week more of break. Plus, when you come back, it\u0092s shopping period, so it\u0092s not the biggest deal if you miss the first couple of days.\nThis brings me to the more important point \u0096 academic scheduling. Finals here are before break. ?. That means break is break is stress-free break. I can\u0092t imagine Winter \u0093Break\u0094 with finals over my head. That\u0092s reason in itself to come to Yale. It matters so much more than you think it does.\n\nACADEMIC REQUIREMENTS\nFor me, the distributional requirement system here is a lot better for me than Harvard\u0092s core curriculum. I like structure and all, but with only 32 courses (at Harvard) and 36 courses (here) to take, I didn\u0092t want to have to waste time taking classes I didn\u0092t like. On the other hand, having no requirements (Brown) tends to allow already single minded students to stick to their comfort zone, and not achieve a liberal arts education (think science nerds ?). Yale\u0092s distributional requirement system allows you ridiculous amounts of freedom in designing your curriculum \u0096 in general, people fulfill their distributional requirements unintentionally. The requirement system + major does a good job of fulfilling the whole broad based education with an area of focus philosophy. Plus, if gives you lots of room to explore. After fulfilling distributional and major requirements, I\u0092ll have half of my courses at Yale left over just for fun!\nSpeaking of majors, people seem to interpret the inability to minor at Yale as a negative. The mentality is that electives should be devoted to exploration, not to a \u0091minor\u0092 (which really doesn\u0092t mean much in terms of academic accomplishment). If you are interested in minoring in music, why not just take the music courses you\u0092re interested in? You\u0092ll avoid red tape and perhaps classes you don\u0092t want to take, and will thus have the freedom to take other courses if you so desire. If you are so committed to a second discipline that you want to commit to studying it, you can double major. But really, most advisors here will tell you just to take classes in the department that interest you. Who cares what it says on your diploma?\nI guess this is the place to talk about strength of academic deparments. I\u0092ve reveived tons of questions about the quality of departments here vs. those at Harvard, and basically the point is that on an undergraduate level, departments at all schools of this caliber are equal. Perhaps the grad school pumps out more history research here, and more mechanical engineering research at MIT, etc., but as an undergrad, you\u0092re not going to outsmart any of the profs. It really shouldn\u0092t be a consideration at all \u0096 all the departments here are incredibly strong. I really don\u0092t know how to emphasize the point any more, but if you\u0092re comparing the qualities of, say, the economics departments at Harvard and Yale, just stop that\u0085 stop that right now. You\u0092re wasting your time, and giving weight to things that don\u0092t matter at all, since you can\u0092t distinguish between grad and undergrad departments (p.s. Yale undergrads have access to all of the grad schools).\n\npart 2\nACADEMIC ENVIRONMENT\nComing from an inner city public school in the West, I already had reservations about Ivy Leagues and a stuffy, snotty environment where everyone has grown up playing field hockey, polo, or rowing crew. I was actually dead-set against Yale because of it. Then my visit showed me a laid back, we\u0092re-smart-but-we-like-to-have-fun-too student body. Here, nobody ever talks about grades, test scores, etc., and as clich\u00e9 as it sounds, people work together, not against each other (even us pre-meds!). We\u0092re are here to enjoy Yale and each other, not to endure these next four years just for an Ivy league diploma. Nobody here has to convince themselves of their happiness; it\u0092s genuine. Giving credit where credit is due, I didn\u0092t find Harvard as bad as Princeton with the whole pretentious atmosphere thing, but at least kids I know at Princeton accept and embrace their conceit, and live in a sort of bliss of arrogance. Harvard students just seems to be miserable and lonely because the environment is so competitive, and because self-image is so intimately tied with \u0091being the best,\u0092 i.e. getting better grades than the guy next to you. It\u0092s weird because many of these same kids wouldn\u0092t be that way at other schools, but it\u0092s just hard to come in as a freshman and single-handedly change the established attitude of the place.\nSpeaking of misery and loneliness, my residential college dean used to be an advisor in one of the houses at Harvard. She has a lot to say about the differences between the two schools, but in an effort not to sounds redundant, she usually tells an illustrative anecdote; she was in charge of a block of 20 students, and only 6 students were not seeing mental health professionals. And that was normal. When I brought this up to a friend of mine at Harvard, she got really defensive and proudly asserted that the vast majority of students were happy \u0096 out of her block of 24, 20 were thrilled to be there. First of all, the criteria for \u0091thrilled to be there\u0092 was \u0091not in therapy\u0092 (that she knew about, at least), and secondly, 20/24? Those are stats to brag about? We at Yale hear that and are just like, what? Mental health help is available and all, but if you\u0092re feeling down or stressed, usually your friends and/or family help you snap out of it, or you go out to lunch with your advisor or something. My dean\u0092s response? How is your family supposed to help you if they are the ones pressuring you? How are your friends supposed to help you out when you\u0092re stressed/depressed when the reason you\u0092re feeling that way is because you\u0092re trying to beat them? Surely many students at Harvard are doing just fine there, but many are \u0091happy\u0092 because being unhappy is a failure \u0096 it would mean their institution isn\u0092t the best. That\u0092s kind of a hard admission to make. Alright \u0096 next topic\u0085 I hate talking about this sort of stuff.\n\nADVISING and UNDERGRADUATE FOCUS\nIn addition to the whole Yale/Harvard decision, I was debating whether to go to a liberal arts college or to a university. In the end, I couldn\u0092t get past how small a liberal arts college actually is, and knew I\u0092d end up feeling claustrophobic, especially after studying abroad. But I still wasn\u0092t ready to give up small classes, close interaction with professors, and a solid web of advisors. Yale was the perfect balance for me. 5200 kids is a great number \u0096 enough to not feel anonymous on campus, bit also to walk around and not recognize every face. You\u0092ll be meeting people up through senior year. Yet, the residential college system gives you the whole family/ tight community thing, with great advising. The deans, masters, and fellows eat with you in the dining hall. More than that though, masters treat us like family here. Just an example - a friend of mine wasn\u0092t feeling too hot after a night of partying, and he ran into his master (Master G, for anyone familiar with Pierson). Master G was just like \u0091Hey, you\u0092re one of my kids here \u0096 come inside and drink some Gatorade.\u0094\nMore on the undergraduate focus \u0096 Harvard is a bigger school, with bigger classes (that was a big negative for me), a bigger campus, and a bigger focus on graduate school. Here, TA\u0092s won\u0092t be teaching your classes (all professors, in fact, are required to teach two undergraduate courses\u0085 that includes all the Nobel laureates and such). Professor accessibility is ridiculous \u0096 I have lunch with my advisor all the time, and have been asked to house-sit and/or babysit for other professors. Access to research is equally ridiculous. I don\u0092t know anyone who has wants to work in a lab, and isn\u0092t, and research grants flow like water when it comes to summer plans (especially abroad). Yale actually has more endowment $$ allocated per undergrad student than Harvard, despite its smaller overall fund.\nJust in general, Yale is Yale College before it is Yale University \u0096 more than a research institution, Yale draws its pride from a vibrant and happy undergraduate student body. The university realizes that its students (not its professors, facilities, history, endowment, etc.) are its biggest asset. Even the layout of the campus clues you in to Yale\u0092s focus \u0096 Old Campus is the center of campus, surrounded more or less by the residential colleges, with the grad schools surrounding the college on the periphery.\n\nHOUSING\nMmmmmm\u0085 Yale housing. Call me shallow, but it\u0092s one of the main reasons I decided to come here. Then again, you\u0092ve got to consider you\u0092re spending 4 years of your life here, so where you live is important. The housing here is awesome \u0096 we basically live in apartments. Common rooms are generally big, as are the bedrooms. Check out Sweet Suites \u0096 that\u0092s actually a pretty accurate cross section of freshman/sophomore housing (typically the worst two years). Stiles is supposed to be the worst by a long shot, and that suite is a sophomore double (again, the worst possible situation), so that\u0092s basically as bad as housing gets here. My point is, housing here is palatial for undergrads \u0096 it only gets better than what you see on Sweet Suites, though not all suites are decorated as well as Eric\u0092s (Berkeley). At Harvard, for admissions weekend, I stayed in Gray\u0092s, which was apparently the \u0093Harvard Hilton.\u0094 Admittedly, the suite was pretty big, but the bedrooms were tiny \u0096 so tiny, in fact, that beds had to be bunked, and the desks had to be put in the common room \u0096 ugh.\nPlus, if you end up wanting to move off campus for whatever reason, apartments and houses near/on campus are abundant and affordable. It\u0092s great to have some friends off campus as far as social life goes, or just for a change of pace. Housing in Cambridge is so expensive, so none but the upper echelons can move off.\nMore than suite layouts, the housing system at Harvard doesn\u0092t lend itself to forming tight communities. The residential houses are sort of split into two groups, both far from classes, and really far from friends in colleges on the opposite side of campus. Neither are close to Harvard Yard (which I found ugly, and not nearly as cohesive as Old Campus). Plus, the housing draw lends itself to drama \u0096 you\u0092re not assigned a college when you first get to school. At the end of the year, you have to block off with your friends, and enter the housing draw\u0085 Well, in college you\u0092re more than likely not going to have a single group of friends, you\u0092ll have many, as will everyone else. This makes blocking a nearly impossible conquest, with someone always ending up hurt. People\u0092s feelings aside, not having a college your first year sort of makes the colleges not as tight as they are here, and people don\u0092t have much college (house) pride\u0085 I guess that\u0092s a theme, though, at Harvard. Pride comes from showing people your diploma, right? Ugh.\n\nSOCIAL LIFE\nHarvard hired a \u0091fun czar\u0092 to look out for the social lives of its students. He called a friend of mine on the Yale College Council to find out where the parties were on Harvard-Yale weekend, so he could tell Harvard students where the \u0091happening parties\u0092 were. Ummm\u0085 ok. Whatever.\nA lot of social life stuff has been covered on the boards here. I haven\u0092t read through all of it, but hopefully it\u0092s pretty accurate. Basically, you can find whatever scene you\u0092re looking for. Pulling pranks, movie nights, comedy/theater/a cappella/cultural shows, Toad\u0092s (\u0091all roads lead to Toad\u0092s), Viva\u0092s/Rudy\u0092s/Richter\u0092s/Bar/Sullivan\u0092s/other bars with excellent pizza, suite parties or parties in old \u0091secret\u0092 (ha!) stone buildings, parties outside, goat roasts, naked parties, pickup soccer in a courtyard, just chilling out, capture the flag on old campus, wine and cheese, dancing of all sorts, spontaneous mud-slip-and-sliding during a rainstorm, marshmallow roasting with hookah and guitar, whatever floats your boat. Hopefully you\u0092ll get a taste at Bulldog Days, although keep in mind that it\u0092s at the beginning of the week right before finals, and this year everyone\u0092s spread throughout the residential colleges, so it\u0092s not gonna be as active as Wednesday-Saturday.\nAt Harvard, on the other hand, Yalies couldn\u0092t find anything to do, so we threw our own parties. Either they were staying in (my admits weekend host and friend of hers drank alone in their rooms on a Saturday night), or they were out in the city, but either way, social life isn\u0092t really campus oriented, and I was looking for a tight campus community. But nothing to do on Harvard-Yale weekend? Are you serious?\n\npart 3\nSTUDENT HAPPINESS\nSo housing and classes are great and all, but ask any Yalie \u0096 this is why they came here. People here are happy. For me, it\u0092s a sense of humor thing. A lot of people don\u0092t really take themselves too seriously here. Thank God. I don\u0092t really know what else to say about this, not that you \u0096 I guess it goes back to what I wrote in the academic environment section.\n\nELITISIM\nRefer to academic environment section, advising section, or anyone I know at Harvard. Send me a message for names.\nBelated note to my Harvard hosts: I still don\u0092t care about your SAT scores, or whom your father knows.\n\nSTUDENT FREEDOM\nYale\u0092s big thing is that the administration trusts its students. One huge advantage of that trust? No RAs\u0085 woo hoo! We don\u0092t have any authority figures living with us \u0096 freshman year or any other year \u0096 from whom we have to hide. If you want to drink in your room, not a problem. If you want to through a party, go ahead. What we have instead are freshman counselors \u0096 seniors in your college who live nearby and provide study breaks (food), advice, and an ear when you need someone to listen. Froco\u0092s (FROsh COunselors) tend to be some of the coolest and most active kids in the college. They also have an unlimited supply of free condoms. Yale just wants you to be safe \u0096 if you get a little out of control at a party, health services is open 24/7, and you can get treated for alcohol poisoning or whatever anonymously. They also have free STD testing\u0085 basically the result of Yale trusting us is that we have a lot fewer problems than other schools. I can\u0092t imagine living with RAs, or having to hide a party (at Harvard\u0092s admit weekend, my hosts sat alone in their suite and took shots out of a Nalgene), or not being allowed to walk around campus with open cups. Life would be so much more complicated. There\u0092s a lot more to say about how much life would suck without the freedoms afforded to us here, but I\u0092m having a mental block and can\u0092t spit it out right now (sorry).\n\nELITISM II\n\nHarvard\u0092s finals clubs aren\u0092t like societies are here. At Yale, society tap night is like a big, school-wide prank. People are dressed up in outrageous costumes, doing outrageous things that other people tell them to do\u0085 it\u0092s a ton of fun \u0096 you\u0092re just laughing so hard whenever you step outside your dorm, it\u0092s miracle I didn\u0092t **** my pants. It\u0092s a lot of fun, and really not elitist at all. In fact, most societies strive to tap a wide diversity of kids, so you\u0092re forced to meet people you wouldn\u0092t otherwise meet. From what I understand of finals clubs, they\u0092re more like Princeton\u0092s eating clubs; exclusive, whitewashed, wealthy, etc. Not my scene, to say the least.\nMore on elitism \u0096 professor elitism. This is really a person thing, but I know several professors at Harvard just \u0091cause my dad\u0092s Ph.D. advisor is up there, and he used to teach at another school in Cambridge, so you know how it goes. Just hearing conversations between them is sort of sickening, with the whole \u0091I\u0092m not going to waste my time on undergrads\u0092 attitude. I\u0092m not gonna go too deep into the whole condescending, snotty professor subject just \u0091cause it\u0092s personal and thus inappropriate, but suffice it to say I haven\u0092t come across any problems like that here.\n\nThis is getting entirely to long.., I\u0092m going to have to start bullet-pointing:\n- Intramurals and club sports aren\u0092t as popular at Harvard as they are here (probably due to the college pride thing), and though I wasn\u0092t going to play varsity sports here, I didn\u0092t want to give up athletics entirely\n- The administration at Harvard is hard to work within \u0096 they\u0092re very much about maintaining the status quo\n- I found Harvard admissions weekend boring, and that I was surrounded by a bunch of smart individuals, not a community.\n- Because of the types of people who choose to attend Harvard, competition between students is unbearable \u0096 I wouldn\u0092t be able to handle it. I\u0092d just get annoyed \u0096 I find competitive people at least as obnoxious as self-centered people\n- Yale likes food \u0096 we have barbecues and themed banquets all the time\n- Master\u0092s teas\u0085 we\u0092ve got \u0091em, they don\u0092t\n- Friends of mine from Harvard (who think they\u0092re happy there) have described it as not a real \u0091rah rah\u0092 type of place\u0085 well, I wanted a rah rah type of place, where the whole student body is proud to call themselves Yalies.\n- There are lots of things that I don\u0092t even realize we have here, that Harvard students don\u0092t have, that visiting friends point out all the time. I don\u0092t know anyone who has chosen Harvard over Yale, visited friends at Yale, and not admitted to making the wrong decision. Read that last sentence again \u0096 I\u0092m not kidding.\n\n\nI sort of ran out of steam midway through this thing, even before I started bulletpointing \u0096 sorry, but if you want to know more about anything, I\u0092m better with personal messages than with board postings.\n\nThe basic point is that I found Harvard hard to turn down because of pressure from people who I don\u0092t care about.

Comments are welcome.\n\nPart 1\n\nJust a preface: read the whole thing \u0096 I\u0092m not organized enough to manage to fit in all the \u0091bigger\u0092 reasons at the top of the essay, and the insignificant ones at the end Also, I\u0092ll try not to make this sound like a bashing thread, but I might focus on why not to choose Harvard over why to choose Yale, just \u0091cause the \u0093why Yale\u0094 topic has been covered pretty extensively on these boards. Finally, most of the reasons Yale rocks Harvard are just totally not quantifiable\u0085 you\u0092ve really just got to be here (and talk to students at Harvard who have visited friends at Yale) to see it.\n\nREPUTATION\nSo, Harvard has the bigger name. Sort of. Well, at least among people who don\u0092t matter. Any grad school/professional school admissions committee, or potential employer is knows that the academic caliber of Harvard and Yale (and several other schools) as institutions and as student bodies are identical.\nThe better point to make in the reputation section is \u0093so what?\u0094 I already avoid telling people where I go to school (the answer is always \u0093back East\u0094 or \u0093Ezra Stiles College\u0094). I always feel like I\u0092m boasting when I say I go to Yale, especially when talking to people who didn\u0092t go to college, or know nothing about Yale other than the fact that it\u0092s an Ivy. I\u0092m not trying to impress anyone, and I hate the \u0093Wow, Yale! You must be smart!\u0094 reaction. With Harvard, it would just be worse, if we\u0092re sticking with the Harvard-has-the-bigger-name point of view. Plus, I feel like many people choose Harvard over other schools because it\u0092s Harvard. How could you resist, right? (Oh, the na\u00efve masses). I didn\u0092t want to be with those whom I not-so-affectionately term \u0091prestige-whores,\u0092 or with people whose parents/family pressured them into going to Harvard. We\u0092re big kids now; we can make our own decision.\n\nSCHEDULING\nYale\u0092s academic calendar rocks. I think this fall classes are starting September 6, and this year I\u0092m done with finals on May 2. That\u0092s over four months of summer break (Harvard gets something very similar, just pushed back one month). Plus, we got 9 days for Thanksgiving (Harvard gets a Thursday/Friday long weekend), 23 days minimum for Winter Break (Harvard got 13 days this year), and two weeks off for Spring Break (Harvard got one). I say 23 days minimum for Winter Break because most people\u0092s finals end before the last day of finals week. Many people have up to a week more of break. Plus, when you come back, it\u0092s shopping period, so it\u0092s not the biggest deal if you miss the first couple of days.\nThis brings me to the more important point \u0096 academic scheduling. Finals here are before break. ?. That means break is break is stress-free break. I can\u0092t imagine Winter \u0093Break\u0094 with finals over my head. That\u0092s reason in itself to come to Yale. It matters so much more than you think it does.\n\nACADEMIC REQUIREMENTS\nFor me, the distributional requirement system here is a lot better for me than Harvard\u0092s core curriculum. I like structure and all, but with only 32 courses (at Harvard) and 36 courses (here) to take, I didn\u0092t want to have to waste time taking classes I didn\u0092t like. On the other hand, having no requirements (Brown) tends to allow already single minded students to stick to their comfort zone, and not achieve a liberal arts education (think science nerds ?). Yale\u0092s distributional requirement system allows you ridiculous amounts of freedom in designing your curriculum \u0096 in general, people fulfill their distributional requirements unintentionally. The requirement system + major does a good job of fulfilling the whole broad based education with an area of focus philosophy. Plus, if gives you lots of room to explore. After fulfilling distributional and major requirements, I\u0092ll have half of my courses at Yale left over just for fun!\nSpeaking of majors, people seem to interpret the inability to minor at Yale as a negative. The mentality is that electives should be devoted to exploration, not to a \u0091minor\u0092 (which really doesn\u0092t mean much in terms of academic accomplishment). If you are interested in minoring in music, why not just take the music courses you\u0092re interested in? You\u0092ll avoid red tape and perhaps classes you don\u0092t want to take, and will thus have the freedom to take other courses if you so desire. If you are so committed to a second discipline that you want to commit to studying it, you can double major. But really, most advisors here will tell you just to take classes in the department that interest you. Who cares what it says on your diploma?\nI guess this is the place to talk about strength of academic deparments. I\u0092ve reveived tons of questions about the quality of departments here vs. those at Harvard, and basically the point is that on an undergraduate level, departments at all schools of this caliber are equal. Perhaps the grad school pumps out more history research here, and more mechanical engineering research at MIT, etc., but as an undergrad, you\u0092re not going to outsmart any of the profs. It really shouldn\u0092t be a consideration at all \u0096 all the departments here are incredibly strong. I really don\u0092t know how to emphasize the point any more, but if you\u0092re comparing the qualities of, say, the economics departments at Harvard and Yale, just stop that\u0085 stop that right now. You\u0092re wasting your time, and giving weight to things that don\u0092t matter at all, since you can\u0092t distinguish between grad and undergrad departments (p.s. Yale undergrads have access to all of the grad schools).\n\npart 2\nACADEMIC ENVIRONMENT\nComing from an inner city public school in the West, I already had reservations about Ivy Leagues and a stuffy, snotty environment where everyone has grown up playing field hockey, polo, or rowing crew. I was actually dead-set against Yale because of it. Then my visit showed me a laid back, we\u0092re-smart-but-we-like-to-have-fun-too student body. Here, nobody ever talks about grades, test scores, etc., and as clich\u00e9 as it sounds, people work together, not against each other (even us pre-meds!). We\u0092re are here to enjoy Yale and each other, not to endure these next four years just for an Ivy league diploma. Nobody here has to convince themselves of their happiness; it\u0092s genuine. Giving credit where credit is due, I didn\u0092t find Harvard as bad as Princeton with the whole pretentious atmosphere thing, but at least kids I know at Princeton accept and embrace their conceit, and live in a sort of bliss of arrogance. Harvard students just seems to be miserable and lonely because the environment is so competitive, and because self-image is so intimately tied with \u0091being the best,\u0092 i.e. getting better grades than the guy next to you. It\u0092s weird because many of these same kids wouldn\u0092t be that way at other schools, but it\u0092s just hard to come in as a freshman and single-handedly change the established attitude of the place.\nSpeaking of misery and loneliness, my residential college dean used to be an advisor in one of the houses at Harvard. She has a lot to say about the differences between the two schools, but in an effort not to sounds redundant, she usually tells an illustrative anecdote; she was in charge of a block of 20 students, and only 6 students were not seeing mental health professionals. And that was normal. When I brought this up to a friend of mine at Harvard, she got really defensive and proudly asserted that the vast majority of students were happy \u0096 out of her block of 24, 20 were thrilled to be there. First of all, the criteria for \u0091thrilled to be there\u0092 was \u0091not in therapy\u0092 (that she knew about, at least), and secondly, 20/24? Those are stats to brag about? We at Yale hear that and are just like, what? Mental health help is available and all, but if you\u0092re feeling down or stressed, usually your friends and/or family help you snap out of it, or you go out to lunch with your advisor or something. My dean\u0092s response? How is your family supposed to help you if they are the ones pressuring you? How are your friends supposed to help you out when you\u0092re stressed/depressed when the reason you\u0092re feeling that way is because you\u0092re trying to beat them? Surely many students at Harvard are doing just fine there, but many are \u0091happy\u0092 because being unhappy is a failure \u0096 it would mean their institution isn\u0092t the best. That\u0092s kind of a hard admission to make. Alright \u0096 next topic\u0085 I hate talking about this sort of stuff.\n\nADVISING and UNDERGRADUATE FOCUS\nIn addition to the whole Yale/Harvard decision, I was debating whether to go to a liberal arts college or to a university. In the end, I couldn\u0092t get past how small a liberal arts college actually is, and knew I\u0092d end up feeling claustrophobic, especially after studying abroad. But I still wasn\u0092t ready to give up small classes, close interaction with professors, and a solid web of advisors. Yale was the perfect balance for me. 5200 kids is a great number \u0096 enough to not feel anonymous on campus, bit also to walk around and not recognize every face. You\u0092ll be meeting people up through senior year. Yet, the residential college system gives you the whole family/ tight community thing, with great advising. The deans, masters, and fellows eat with you in the dining hall. More than that though, masters treat us like family here. Just an example - a friend of mine wasn\u0092t feeling too hot after a night of partying, and he ran into his master (Master G, for anyone familiar with Pierson). Master G was just like \u0091Hey, you\u0092re one of my kids here \u0096 come inside and drink some Gatorade.\u0094\nMore on the undergraduate focus \u0096 Harvard is a bigger school, with bigger classes (that was a big negative for me), a bigger campus, and a bigger focus on graduate school. Here, TA\u0092s won\u0092t be teaching your classes (all professors, in fact, are required to teach two undergraduate courses\u0085 that includes all the Nobel laureates and such). Professor accessibility is ridiculous \u0096 I have lunch with my advisor all the time, and have been asked to house-sit and/or babysit for other professors. Access to research is equally ridiculous. I don\u0092t know anyone who has wants to work in a lab, and isn\u0092t, and research grants flow like water when it comes to summer plans (especially abroad). Yale actually has more endowment $$ allocated per undergrad student than Harvard, despite its smaller overall fund.\nJust in general, Yale is Yale College before it is Yale University \u0096 more than a research institution, Yale draws its pride from a vibrant and happy undergraduate student body. The university realizes that its students (not its professors, facilities, history, endowment, etc.) are its biggest asset. Even the layout of the campus clues you in to Yale\u0092s focus \u0096 Old Campus is the center of campus, surrounded more or less by the residential colleges, with the grad schools surrounding the college on the periphery.\n\nHOUSING\nMmmmmm\u0085 Yale housing. Call me shallow, but it\u0092s one of the main reasons I decided to come here. Then again, you\u0092ve got to consider you\u0092re spending 4 years of your life here, so where you live is important. The housing here is awesome \u0096 we basically live in apartments. Common rooms are generally big, as are the bedrooms. Check out Sweet Suites \u0096 that\u0092s actually a pretty accurate cross section of freshman/sophomore housing (typically the worst two years). Stiles is supposed to be the worst by a long shot, and that suite is a sophomore double (again, the worst possible situation), so that\u0092s basically as bad as housing gets here. My point is, housing here is palatial for undergrads \u0096 it only gets better than what you see on Sweet Suites, though not all suites are decorated as well as Eric\u0092s (Berkeley). At Harvard, for admissions weekend, I stayed in Gray\u0092s, which was apparently the \u0093Harvard Hilton.\u0094 Admittedly, the suite was pretty big, but the bedrooms were tiny \u0096 so tiny, in fact, that beds had to be bunked, and the desks had to be put in the common room \u0096 ugh.\nPlus, if you end up wanting to move off campus for whatever reason, apartments and houses near/on campus are abundant and affordable. It\u0092s great to have some friends off campus as far as social life goes, or just for a change of pace. Housing in Cambridge is so expensive, so none but the upper echelons can move off.\nMore than suite layouts, the housing system at Harvard doesn\u0092t lend itself to forming tight communities. The residential houses are sort of split into two groups, both far from classes, and really far from friends in colleges on the opposite side of campus. Neither are close to Harvard Yard (which I found ugly, and not nearly as cohesive as Old Campus). Plus, the housing draw lends itself to drama \u0096 you\u0092re not assigned a college when you first get to school. At the end of the year, you have to block off with your friends, and enter the housing draw\u0085 Well, in college you\u0092re more than likely not going to have a single group of friends, you\u0092ll have many, as will everyone else. This makes blocking a nearly impossible conquest, with someone always ending up hurt. People\u0092s feelings aside, not having a college your first year sort of makes the colleges not as tight as they are here, and people don\u0092t have much college (house) pride\u0085 I guess that\u0092s a theme, though, at Harvard. Pride comes from showing people your diploma, right? Ugh.\n\nSOCIAL LIFE\nHarvard hired a \u0091fun czar\u0092 to look out for the social lives of its students. He called a friend of mine on the Yale College Council to find out where the parties were on Harvard-Yale weekend, so he could tell Harvard students where the \u0091happening parties\u0092 were. Ummm\u0085 ok. Whatever.\nA lot of social life stuff has been covered on the boards here. I haven\u0092t read through all of it, but hopefully it\u0092s pretty accurate. Basically, you can find whatever scene you\u0092re looking for. Pulling pranks, movie nights, comedy/theater/a cappella/cultural shows, Toad\u0092s (\u0091all roads lead to Toad\u0092s), Viva\u0092s/Rudy\u0092s/Richter\u0092s/Bar/Sullivan\u0092s/other bars with excellent pizza, suite parties or parties in old \u0091secret\u0092 (ha!) stone buildings, parties outside, goat roasts, naked parties, pickup soccer in a courtyard, just chilling out, capture the flag on old campus, wine and cheese, dancing of all sorts, spontaneous mud-slip-and-sliding during a rainstorm, marshmallow roasting with hookah and guitar, whatever floats your boat. Hopefully you\u0092ll get a taste at Bulldog Days, although keep in mind that it\u0092s at the beginning of the week right before finals, and this year everyone\u0092s spread throughout the residential colleges, so it\u0092s not gonna be as active as Wednesday-Saturday.\nAt Harvard, on the other hand, Yalies couldn\u0092t find anything to do, so we threw our own parties. Either they were staying in (my admits weekend host and friend of hers drank alone in their rooms on a Saturday night), or they were out in the city, but either way, social life isn\u0092t really campus oriented, and I was looking for a tight campus community. But nothing to do on Harvard-Yale weekend? Are you serious?\n\npart 3\nSTUDENT HAPPINESS\nSo housing and classes are great and all, but ask any Yalie \u0096 this is why they came here. People here are happy. For me, it\u0092s a sense of humor thing. A lot of people don\u0092t really take themselves too seriously here. Thank God. I don\u0092t really know what else to say about this, not that you \u0096 I guess it goes back to what I wrote in the academic environment section.\n\nELITISIM\nRefer to academic environment section, advising section, or anyone I know at Harvard. Send me a message for names.\nBelated note to my Harvard hosts: I still don\u0092t care about your SAT scores, or whom your father knows.\n\nSTUDENT FREEDOM\nYale\u0092s big thing is that the administration trusts its students. One huge advantage of that trust? No RAs\u0085 woo hoo! We don\u0092t have any authority figures living with us \u0096 freshman year or any other year \u0096 from whom we have to hide. If you want to drink in your room, not a problem. If you want to through a party, go ahead. What we have instead are freshman counselors \u0096 seniors in your college who live nearby and provide study breaks (food), advice, and an ear when you need someone to listen. Froco\u0092s (FROsh COunselors) tend to be some of the coolest and most active kids in the college. They also have an unlimited supply of free condoms. Yale just wants you to be safe \u0096 if you get a little out of control at a party, health services is open 24/7, and you can get treated for alcohol poisoning or whatever anonymously. They also have free STD testing\u0085 basically the result of Yale trusting us is that we have a lot fewer problems than other schools. I can\u0092t imagine living with RAs, or having to hide a party (at Harvard\u0092s admit weekend, my hosts sat alone in their suite and took shots out of a Nalgene), or not being allowed to walk around campus with open cups. Life would be so much more complicated. There\u0092s a lot more to say about how much life would suck without the freedoms afforded to us here, but I\u0092m having a mental block and can\u0092t spit it out right now (sorry).\n\nELITISM II\n\nHarvard\u0092s finals clubs aren\u0092t like societies are here. At Yale, society tap night is like a big, school-wide prank. People are dressed up in outrageous costumes, doing outrageous things that other people tell them to do\u0085 it\u0092s a ton of fun \u0096 you\u0092re just laughing so hard whenever you step outside your dorm, it\u0092s miracle I didn\u0092t **** my pants. It\u0092s a lot of fun, and really not elitist at all. In fact, most societies strive to tap a wide diversity of kids, so you\u0092re forced to meet people you wouldn\u0092t otherwise meet. From what I understand of finals clubs, they\u0092re more like Princeton\u0092s eating clubs; exclusive, whitewashed, wealthy, etc. Not my scene, to say the least.\nMore on elitism \u0096 professor elitism. This is really a person thing, but I know several professors at Harvard just \u0091cause my dad\u0092s Ph.D. advisor is up there, and he used to teach at another school in Cambridge, so you know how it goes. Just hearing conversations between them is sort of sickening, with the whole \u0091I\u0092m not going to waste my time on undergrads\u0092 attitude. I\u0092m not gonna go too deep into the whole condescending, snotty professor subject just \u0091cause it\u0092s personal and thus inappropriate, but suffice it to say I haven\u0092t come across any problems like that here.\n\nThis is getting entirely to long.., I\u0092m going to have to start bullet-pointing:\n- Intramurals and club sports aren\u0092t as popular at Harvard as they are here (probably due to the college pride thing), and though I wasn\u0092t going to play varsity sports here, I didn\u0092t want to give up athletics entirely\n- The administration at Harvard is hard to work within \u0096 they\u0092re very much about maintaining the status quo\n- I found Harvard admissions weekend boring, and that I was surrounded by a bunch of smart individuals, not a community.\n- Because of the types of people who choose to attend Harvard, competition between students is unbearable \u0096 I wouldn\u0092t be able to handle it. I\u0092d just get annoyed \u0096 I find competitive people at least as obnoxious as self-centered people\n- Yale likes food \u0096 we have barbecues and themed banquets all the time\n- Master\u0092s teas\u0085 we\u0092ve got \u0091em, they don\u0092t\n- Friends of mine from Harvard (who think they\u0092re happy there) have described it as not a real \u0091rah rah\u0092 type of place\u0085 well, I wanted a rah rah type of place, where the whole student body is proud to call themselves Yalies.\n- There are lots of things that I don\u0092t even realize we have here, that Harvard students don\u0092t have, that visiting friends point out all the time. I don\u0092t know anyone who has chosen Harvard over Yale, visited friends at Yale, and not admitted to making the wrong decision. Read that last sentence again \u0096 I\u0092m not kidding.\n\n\nI sort of ran out of steam midway through this thing, even before I started bulletpointing \u0096 sorry, but if you want to know more about anything, I\u0092m better with personal messages than with board postings.\n\nThe basic point is that I found Harvard hard to turn down because of pressure from people who I don\u0092t care about. Even if it was from people who I did care about, this is about my school, my fit, my happiness\u0085 I don\u0092t think I could be happier.

However, they do announce the top student in a class overall.\n\nI know that last year I was ranked 1st out of about 60 kids, but today they did something unorthodox and they showed us an entire ranking of the class based on our first set of test results in our Junior year. I didn't do amazingly well on them, but I wasn't hugely fussed because I was told that they weren't very important. Nevertheless, my rank has dropped all the way down to 7th. I can admit that I'm taking one of the hardest combination of subjects that my school offers, whilst those ranked higher up had fairly easier subjects. But I feel worried that I've got from <5% to <20% in just one semester and wanted to know if this has much of an impact on college applications (I'm an international student).\n\nI might sound a bit paranoid, but I'm just really disappointed that there's been such a huge drop in my performance (or my performance relative to classmates).

I took TOEFL and I got 107/120 (the only part I'm not satisfied with is speaking; I was so distracted by other people speaking at the same time as me that I couldn\u2019t concentrate at all).\n\nMy ECs... you know, it's so different here, our school basically doesn't offer anything interesting after regular classes, but I do my best to participate in some interesting activities outside school.\nI belong to Geography Club and Biology Club. I\u2019m also a member of Culture Club, where I\u2019m an editor of a newspaper, I also occasionally write articles for our school newspaper.\nI take part in Christian Club discussions and was a class leader for one year. I took part in two school plays (OK., I bet they\u2019re waaaaaaay worse  than the ones at boarding schools such as these I'm applying to, but my school just doesn\u2019t have good facilities), I was dancing in a modern dance group for 2 years, but had to give it up. I can play a piano.\nI participated in many contests (but their names surely don't mean anything to American people), my biggest achievement was the 3rd place in the country in an English language contest.\n\nI\u2019m a language freak \u2013 I\u2019m learning English, German, Spanish and French on my own with pretty good results. That\u2019s something what sets me apart from other applicants, \u2018cause I suppose that most of them don\u2019t study 4 languages on their own.\n\nI had phone interviews with schools. All but Mercersburg and SPS went very well (an interview with Deerfield was particularly great). Mercersburg and SPS were OK., but I have an impression that my interviewer and I didn\u2019t get along very well. And the thing I\u2019m most worried about is that my 1st choice is SPS \u2013 I simply love it \u2013 but the interview was so-so (it was also my first interview).\n\nTeacher recommendations should be very good. I don\u2019t know how they will assess my essays, but I tried to write them as well as I could. I really love writing, although obviously I'm better at writing in my native language.\n\nAnd the most important thing, which can hurt me a lot \u2013 I need a full financial aid package.\nOtherwise I couldn\u2019t attend.\n\nAny suggestions?

Do not thank me, thank other memmbers.\n\nDescribe the results of important conflicts between West Europe and the Middle East during the post-classical period.\n\nHmm... the Muslims were defeated at Battle of Tours by Charles Martel ~700 CE, which stopped the expansion into W. Europe.\nAnd during the crusades, from ~1000-1300 CE, the Christians were motivated by not only religion but also greed to conquer Jerusalem, after the Seljuk Turks sucess previously. The Crusades were a failure, but resulted in W. Europe rediscovery of past, interaction with more advanced Islam empire, which lead to the Renaissance and all that good stuff.\nAnd around late 15th, the Spanish inquistion began, and helped drive out Islamic influences.\n\nI'm pretty sure the main conflict during that time was the Crusades, right? I guess first a bit of background on the Crusades would help. The main point of the Crusades was for the European Christians to take back the Holy Land, Jerusalem, from the Muslims in the Middle East. I think there were 6 major Crusades, but only one or two were actually successful (iffy on that).\n\nThe main result of the Crusades was the spread of Islamic ideas and culture into European society. The Middle East borrowed heavily from the Greek and Roman philosophers and incorporated that into their own culture. When the Europeans came into contact with the Muslims, these ideas spread from the Middle East back into Europe. The rediscovery of this classic thinking would eventually lead to the major revolutions during the Middle Ages, namely the Renaissance, the Protestant Reformation, the Scientific Revolution, and the Enlightenment.\n\n\nWhat were the simlarities between the fall/decline of Han and Roman Empires?\n\nBoth empires had problems with tax collections. The empire was too spread out, and it was difficult to keep their populations under control. As their taxes were less, the public safety and military was less powerful, and the trade routes declined, further weakening the empires.\n\nThe Han had problems with decentralization; powerful landlords took power and were hard to control. Also, once the Roman empire fell it was divided into the east and the west. (Random: The West fell significantly further than the East did.) Plagues caused a dramatic decrease in the population, especially for Rome.\n\nFinally, nomadic invasions were a part of both of their declines, however more apparent in Rome. The Han were invaded by the Xiongnu, although they were already on the decline when taken over. The Romans were hurt by the Huns, Ostrogoths, and Visigoths (I think?)\n\nThe fall of the Han and Roman Empires were similar in the subject that they can both be attributed to specific external and internal forces.\n\nThe Romans faced external pressure from Germanic invaders up north. Later on, Attila the Hun and his forces forced the Germanic tribes into Rome and the Visigoths decimated the empire. Similarly, after Han China was weakened, the Xiongnu invaded the region.\n\nAs far as internal factors go, Rome was led by some pretty bad leaders during its collapse. This, combined with its immense size and the cost to maintain it led to internal decay. Dicletian was the emperor who split Rome into two halves. Constantine, who created Constantinople, united the empire again, but after his death, the kingdom was split again. No one was able to successfully reunite the kingdom after his death, and Rome went through a period where over 25 emperors took over and died violently in a 50 year period. These men were known as barrack emperors, due to their military background. As this was happening, the eastern half of Rome thrived at Constantinople, while the west died out.\n\nIn Han China, when Wang Mang became emperor, he instated reforms that were vastly unsuccessful. He tried to modify land ownership and currency, which caused chaos for the rich and poor alike. This led to civil unrest and peasant uprising. Combined with famine and floods, China became extremely weak allowing Wang Mang's enemies to easily take over.\n\nCompare/Contrast the differences of China's influence over Korea, Vietnam, and Japan (in the 20th century?)\n\nChina often invaded Korea and Vietnam, while establishing commercial relations with all three (Japan, Korea, Vietnam).\nDuring the Silla Dynasty, the Tang emperor was recognized as overlord, and Korea became a vassal state with a tributary relationship. The Korean court was organized similarily to the Chinese. Also, the capital at Kumsong was modeled on the Tang Chang'an. The Koreans also were interested in Confucianism and Chan Buddhism. But in Korea, artistocracy was more powerful, and there wasn't a merit-based bureacracy.\n\nIn Vietnam, they adopted Chinese agricultural and irrigation methods. They use Confucian texts and had tributary relations. Vietnam retained it's religions and women were in higher status.\n\nIn Japan, the Nara and Heian periods were strongly influenced by Chinese. In the Nara (capital) was modeled of of Chang'an as well. They had similar bureacracy, equal-field sysem, and support of Confucianism and Buddhism, but still kept Shintoism.\nIn the Heian period, the literature imitated Chinese works and was written in Chinese.

The Corporation awarded two Education Award Program grants to RFCUNY that were categorized as Professional Model grants.\n\nSUMMARY OF RESULTS\n\nAs a result of applying our procedures, we questioned education awards of $16,152,414 and draw downs of $773,254. In general, we questioned the education awards for members whose eligibility was not established in accordance with grant requirements for criminal background checks. Draw downs were questioned mostly for fixed fees related to members whose eligibility we questioned and also for drawing down in excess of fees earned. In addition, our compliance findings when taken as a whole indicate pervasive problems of eligibility, timekeeping, and documentation. A questioned cost is an alleged violation of a provision of law, regulation, contract, grant, cooperative agreement, or other agreement or document governing the expenditure of funds or a finding that, at the time of testing,\nincludes costs not supported by adequate documentation.\n\n\u2026Participants who successfully complete terms of service under AmeriCorps grants are eligible for education awards and, in some cases, accrued interest awards funded by the Corporation\u2019s National Service Trust. These award amounts are not funded by Corporation grants and thus are not included in claimed grant costs. But at the time that a grant is awarded, and due to the grant award, these amounts become immediate obligations of the National Service Trust. Therefore, as part of our agreed-upon procedures, and using the same criteria used for the grantee\u2019s claimed costs, we determined the effect of our findings on AmeriCorps members\u2019 entitlement to education and accrued interest awards.\n\nThe following is a summary of grant compliance testing results\u2026\n\n1. RFCUNY drew down more funds than it was due.\n\n2. RFCUNY did not follow certain AmeriCorps Provisions.\n\n3. The supervisory signature on members\u2019 timesheets was not the members\u2019 supervisor, or that of someone with direct knowledge of hours served by the members.\n\n4. Members did not always record actual service hours on their timesheets.\n\n5. Some members\u2019 timesheet hours were not accurately recorded in the Corporation\u2019s Web-Based Reporting System.\n\n6. RFCUNY did not require its members to timely submit their member contracts, forms, and timesheets.\n\n7. RFCUNY used preprinted member documentation and did not ensure that all member documentation was completed, signed, and dated.\n\n8. RFCUNY did not maintain documentation to demonstrate that each member\u2019s evaluation complied with AmeriCorps Regulations and the Member Agreement.\n\n9. RFCUNY did not maintain documentation to demonstrate that members received criminal background checks and that any background checks conducted complied with AmeriCorps Provisions.\n\n10. RFCUNY entered incorrect member start dates in Corporation systems and in member contracts.\n\n11. Some members worked beyond their contract-end date.

Actually, I have a multitude of diseases. These diseases are called....\n\n\n....procrastination. no will to do your homework in the right times. not being ambitious enough to go and taste success...laziness.... \n\n^matter of fact intro meant to catch attention. I'm sorry, if i sounded dysfunctional to you guys.... :P\n\nyea, I'm pretty sure some of us experienced this. But, this is odd. No amount of persuasion, from my parents to my counselers (school/college counselers, that is), friends, so on, can persuade me to kick that habit of, to put it in general terms, laziness. When I was in middle school, I was success driven. Got above 3.9 the whole 3 years, and generally, no problems socially....got along everyone fine. (expect for the I-like-this-person-and-i-dunno-what-to-do debacle...sorted out now.) I felt that I put in at least 90% of what I did.\n\nWell, this became weird. I started to procrastinate in High School. But, courseload wasn't bad. managed a 4.1 freshmen year. Soph year: huge hit, with my very first C's in high school (resulting from H. Algebra II), getting knocked over the head by less-than-crap performances in band and tennis, unexpectadly. Procrastination became more apparent...but somehow, I managed to keep a 4.0 GPA W at the end of my soph year.\n\nJunior year was when things really started, excaberated by the economic slump (hit us pretty hard), oncoming prospect of the SAT's, and taking AP Physics cuz my freind (who was one math class ahead of every other class of 2010er). Well, if I thought I got knocked over the head in my sophomore year, this one bludgeoned me with a **** stick...\n\nD's both semesters in AP Physics. I lost all motivation to really do my homework, except for the fact that I musn't get any other grades below a C, and that, i discovered later, i still had a bit of hope for success. But, all the sudden, i got lazy. even with ample time, I didn't want to do my homework, even with my parents' frustration and freind's persuasion and, i dunno what not. Turns out, whatever i say to my parents (i'll do my homework, don't worry, i got this.) but, whatever i said was lies (it transpired later on, and such) and i don't know why I just didn't want to do my homework. Somehow, now i have a 3.7 W gpa, but looks like i was born into the wrong generation: the UC's are cutting spots by the thousands. It seems slim that I would get into UC Irvine or UC Santa Barbara, and I sure as hell do not want to go to UCR. Call me shortsighted, but I am gradually picking up the slack..... I dunno. I lost my mom's trust in the academics (something that has mixed feelings: I really don't care at times, but sometimes I feel guilty, other times, i just get annoyed from constant yelling and such..)\n\nIt's weird. With most of my freinds, their motivation to succeed is always there. WIth me, no matter how much motivation I try to muster, I can never really wake myself up to do the homework and study. Soo many times, I reflected. and found: I am lazy. I am too distracted. I must do my homework.\n\nCould it all started because I did the computer too much. (no, not CC.) or, was it that i was an ignorant person? or, was it that i was worried about the troubles of having a soft spot for this one girl? or such? Or, out of rebellion, for my mom would not support what i love doin (tennis, saxophone improvement, such). Or, that my mom seems to focus entirely on me at the moment, and always \"screams\" that even UCR would not accept me?\n\nCall me hindsighted, but I know the possiblities that can occur. Every single one. Well aware of them. I am somewhat prepared to accept Cal State or UCR/UCI, but i really want to go to either UCI or UCSB, for their location, for their education, for their programs...\n\nBut main question is, how do you jump start the batteries of motivation to actually study? I want to work hard, but even to this hour, I trudge at getting my summer class homework completed. (thank goodness I actually have time/motivation to complete ALL my homework...) I tried, it seemed that laziness is in my blood. (even though none of my family members possess that trait.) I feel guilty, I feel bad, I cry that I have failed myself and my parents, and worse, we face fiscal instability. (OK, not that instable, as we had already planned PLAN B 4 years ago, 2nd house and all, thank goodness. :P)\n\nSo, any ideas? I fear that I would not gain anything out of this thread, out of this confession. Too many times, I have lied to myself about getting work done, as it transpired. Yes, I am guilty. My laziness is beguiling. and such and such....\n\nI dunno, all it takes is to do your homework, and follow through. Nobody can mend the years of the mess created by procrastination. But I die to correct it, seek a new beginning that actually occurs.\n\n\nHow to kick yourself to finish your homework on time?

I took the ACT in April, and received a 34. I took it again in May, and received a 32.

I retook them in October, and I scored CR: 800, Math: 670, Writing: 800. So far so good...at least, in everything but math.\n\nBut here's the kicker. I took the SAT Subject Tests in June, and I got the following scores:\n\nChemistry: 640\nMath 2: 590\nSpanish: 690\n\n\nI'm set to retake the subject tests in November--this Saturday. But what if I do poorly again? Yale's website shows that they want all tests from all administrations from all testing agencies if you want to submit both SAT and ACT score results, meaning that I would have to send them all of the above scores, and my new SAT II scores, whether I do well or not. (As seen below.)\n\n\"However, and this is important, if you elect to use the SAT scores, you must report all scores from all SAT exams (both SAT I and SAT II) that you have taken. If you elect to use ACT scores, you must report all scores from all ACT exams you have taken. And if you choose to use a combination of SAT and ACT results, we require that you report all scores from both agencies.\"\n\n\nSo, my ultimate question is, is it worth it to take a gamble and send them the score reports for all of my SAT (I and II) results? Or should I stick with the 32 and the 34 I have on the ACT to make things simple? The other dilemma is that for both administrations of the SAT I and II, I initially had scores that were quite poor. My math score even actually went down the second time I took it on the SAT I! Would this just serve to make my application more convoluted?\n\n\nIn essence, I'm extremely confused and unsure as to what scores would be best to report.

Paying for an education is a serious problem for both parents and students.  Here are some ways to get college credit at much less expense than you might expect.\n\nThe Internet offers many options.  Other than to say that you should use your search engines and also check with the school of your choice, I will not discuss them here.\n\nMany states have programs similar to Florida\u0092s Bright Futures which can pay for much of your college expense.  Check your state's program on the Internet.\n\nCheck into the Junior Reserve Officers Training Corps Program while you\u0092re still in high school or getting ready to go.  You have to put up with a lot, not only from the course, but from fellow students, but, believe me the outcome can be great.  You can earn a full scholarship, even outside your own state, and get a stipend besides.  Some of the programs include room and board.\n\nDuring your four years in college you\u0092ll probably spend part of your summers with the military.  Navy ROTC members, for example, may spend time at sea while Army, Air Force and Marine cadets may spend time at various bases and doing things similar to what you\u0092ll encounter when going on active duty.\n\nYou\u0092re not limited to the service represented by the ROTC unit you join.  You probably will be able to choose which service you actually join upon graduation.  I say \u0093probably\u0094 because the needs of the military often dictate what you actually can do.\n\nAlso, those gold bars will feel awfully good when you graduate.  Should you decide to make a career of the military, you\u0092ll find that gold or silver on your collar means a lot more retirement money than stripes on your arm.  Medical and educational programs for families are worth looking at, too.\n\nIf you don\u0092t want to go that route, you can pick up 30 semester hours in less than a week at a much lower cost in money and time than actually attending class.  There are five general College Level Examination Program tests, each worth six credits.   They are: English Composition without essay; Social Science & History; Natural Sciences, Humanities and College Mathematics.  CLEP General and Subject examinations are accepted for credit by more than 2,900 colleges and universities.\n\nThese tests are usually equivalent to your first year of college.  There are many other exams available for credit.  Check with the school of your choice for more information.  They can often be used as electives.\n\nThese are generally free to military personnel and some civilians.  Otherwise, you may have to pay a charge \u0096 but it\u0092s much less and takes much less time than actually attending class.\n\nEnlisting in the military often results in your state\u0092s guaranteeing you an education as long as you meet the qualifications which depend upon the state.  As another possibility, you may be able to \u0093challenge\u0094 a course; i.e., take the final exam and if you pass, you get the credit.\n\nSome schools even offer credit for \u0093life experience,\u0094 but you have to, again, check with the school to see what they will allow.\n\nOk.  Let\u0092s say you have completed college and now you\u0092re looking at having to pay back those enormous loans.  There\u0092s a way to make it easier.  Here\u0092s an excerpt from FinAid | Loans | Loan Forgiveness\n\nStudent loan forgiveness programs and service payback programs are really just a variation of a work-contingent student financial aid program.  For example, service payback programs cover all or a portion of a student's costs if they agree to work for a specific period of time in a certain field or job after completing their education.  These programs pay for a student's expense while they are attending school.\n\nOne of the possibilities here is becoming a teacher for awhile.  I\u0092ve not only given you some suggestions on how to get your college education at less cost but also how to make paying for it easier.\n\nGood luck.

Thanks!\n\nThink carefully about the issue presented in the following excerpt and the assignment below\nA person does not simply \"receive\" his or her identity. Identity is much more than the name or features one is born with. True identity is something people must create for themselves by making choices that are significant and that require a courageous commitment in the face of challenges. Identity means having ideas and values that one lives by.\nAdapted from Thomas Merton, Contemplation in a World of Action\nAssignment:\nIs identity something people are born with or given, or is it something people create for themselves? Plan and write an essay in which you develop your point of view on this issue. Support your position with reasoning and examples taken from your reading, studies, experience, or observations.\n\nThe desire to fit in often drives a person to change aspects of him or herself. Society's attitude towards those that are different forces this desire, and as a result, many people create new identities based on what they believe are the social norms. This is a prevalent idea in literature, namely in The Great Gatsby, where a man builds a decadent empire around this concept. In addition, with the prevalence of pop culture, the desire to fit in can be even greater. Many of those who could have had great futures were pulled down by a desire to be \"normal,\" however, they could never escape their innate identities.\nIn Fitzgerald's Great Gatsby, Gatsby appears to be a charismatic and successful man. However, his entire being is a facade, a mere \"identity\" that he has created in order to fit in. He is actually the son of a poor man, a stigma which he believes has haunted his entire life. Gatsby believes that he can only achieve his ultimate goal, marrying his lifelong love, Daisy, if he is rich and successful. Although Gatsby is able to achieve wealth and notoriety, he cannot escape his true identity. The rich people can see through Gatsby's facade no matter how lavishly he lives, or how successful he is. In the end, his attempt to change his identity ultimately leads to his death. This shows that even the most extreme attempts to change oneself can prove to be futile and our identities remain with us from birth.\nIn a more modern example, Rick Rosner, the man with the highest IQ in the world, physically tried to create a new identities for himself. As a teenager in a small town, he was well known for his intelligence. However, he was always insecure about the fact that he could not get a girlfriend. As a result, he broke into his school to change all of the grades on his high school transcript. This marked the beginning of his life long obsession to fit in. When the people in his town were not convinced that he was \"normal\", he ran away and joined another school. Rick ultimately went to and completed high school four times in order to escape his \"identity\" as a smart guy. Unfortunately, he realized that he could not, and stopped, at an age well above that of a college graduate. In an attempt to change his identity, Rick Rosner, possibly the brightest mind in the world, wasted his youth on changing an inescapable identity.\nA person's identity is as much a part of them as any body part is. Any attempt to change or alter the identity ultimately results in pain and failure.

However, it is this same fact that makes the APUSH exam easy to pass IF you prepare correctly and focus your time effectively. I figured I would write this step-by-step guide to help everyone out who was going to take the exam in may 2011.\n\nBasically the overall preparation process goes like this:\n\n1. Understand the exam process\n2. Learn the historical information\n3. Take practice exams, figure out your weaknesses and review the necessary concepts\n4. Learn to write DBQs/FRQs and practice writing them.\n\nRinse and repeat steps 3 and 4 as necessary. Obviously the above is easier said than done, so lets break it down.\n\nSTEP 1 - Understanding the exam process\n\nThis step consists of learning how the exam works, what information will be tested and how that information will be tested. How many multiple choice questions? how many essays? How much time do we have? etc.\n\nThis guide answers all of those questions:\n- AP US History Exam Grading - AP US History Exam Review Course -\n\nSTEP 2 - Learn the historical information\n\nNow that you know exactly what is tested on the exam. You now need to learn that actual information. If you are taking a classroom based class then this information is provided to you in the form of a textbook. In order to get a 5 on the exam, you need to read the entire textbook. Don't slack off and make excuses. Saying you are going to read a review book instead of the textbook is just making an excuse to be lazy. Sit down, read the textbook and know the information.\n\nSTEP 3 - Take practice exams, figure out your weaknesses and review the necessary concepts\n\nOnce you've finished reading the textbook it is now time to take practice exams. Practice exams are the best way to review since you get real world experience on what to expect on the real APUSH exams. Old released exams are good but don't provide you with much feedback other than the what you got wrong. Its time consuming to go back and analyze the results. The real advantage comes when you break down what you know and what you don't know. Then review the information you don't know. Doing the trial and error method of review is the absolutely best way to prepare for the exam. Repeat this step over and over. Doing this process effectively will make the difference between getting a 4 and a 5. I would recommend using these simulation exams since it breaks down your results VERY DETAILED. It gives you your AP score, what time periods you got correct, what question types you got right and then gives you a list of topics to review. It pretty much tells you what to review.\n\n- AP US History Practice Test - AP US History Exam Review Course -\n\nSTEP 4 - Learn to write DBQs/FRQs and practice writing them.\n\nOver 50% of your entire score is going to come from essays. As a result, learning to write a perfect APUSH essay is absolutely necessary. If you can't write a good essay then you will absolutely not be able to get a 5. To learn to write a good essay you simply need to review old DBQ and FRQ prompts and practice writing responses to them. Make sure to time yourself correctly to give you a similar writing experience. Make sure to practice writing legibly if your handwriting is bad. Print out sheets like the one below and just practice until you get good. If the reader can't read your writing then you will get a 0 on the essay.\n\nhttp://www.abctooncenter.com/abclrn/ltrs&copy.gif\n\ngetting a 0 will pretty much guarantee you wont get a 5.\n\nWell, thats all there is to it. If you can do the 4 above steps you will absolutely get a 5. Remember only 10% of test takers get a 5 but using effective study strategies and the right tools getting one of those 5 will be easier than ever. Remember, 90% of test takers don't get a 5 simply because they used ineffective study strategies and didn't allocate their time effectively. Don't be one of those 90%!!!\n\nGood luck everyone and study hard!

It is apparently happening at my kid's public high school.\n\nThey are proposing to close a large budget deficit by laying off many teachers.  At the same time, they are proposing to add many \"dual enrollment\" classes to offer combined high school and college credit.  Those dual enrollment classes would be taught by adjunct instructors provided by the community college.\n\nOur state prohibits laying off teachers for purely economic reasons.  Therefore, they have to rationalize it as a change of curriculum.  So they are eliminating the current system of \"honors\" classes taught by high school teachers.  A few would remain, but would now be renamed \"advanced classes.\"  Most of these classes would be replaced by the dual enrollment classes.\n\nThe administration is actually proposing that kids who are above average take TEN college level classes as a 11th grader.  Under the current curriculum, these students would typically take one AP class and 3 or 4 year-long honors classes.\n\nTo top it all off, they are proposing to send all of the above average kids to a separate building that is rented space.  That takes advantage of a loophole in the union teacher contract that limits the use of non-union teachers.\n\nThe community college instructors would not receive benefits and part of their costs would be subsidized by state grants and other funds provided to the community college from participating communities. The end result is that the CC adjuncts are much cheaper per class than regular school teachers.\n\nI just read a study that high school teachers have better results teaching college level classes to high school students than outside college instructors.  The study found that this result was from the fact that high school teachers are accustomed to teaching 16 and 17 year olds, and can relate better to them.  They also have more education in educational methods than adjunct college instructors, who might have little or no educational training.\n\nAnyone else see this occuring elsewhere?  Any thoughts?\n\nP.S. - I am a concerned parent, not a teacher.

Such an admission of ignorance is not easy.\nAs Thoreau says, \u0093How can we remember our ignorance which our growth requires, when we are using our knowledge all the time?\u0094\n\n\u2028Assignment:\u2028Does the present system of education encourage us to admit our lack of knowledge, or is there too much pressure to demonstrate the acquisition of knowledge? Plan your response, and then write an essay.\n\n\n\nThe main aim of education is to provide water, sunlight and nutrients to the growing minds of the young generation. However the reality of the present educational system is that it is merely concentrating on the \u0091essential\u0092 bit and only stuffing the student\u0092s brain with facts and figures. It just seems like the system is producing mundane people who pays their tax and participate in appropriate activities within the society. In our society, being \u0091smart\u0092 is defined by our grades and how much knowledge we possess, even though being smart does not really mean that one is actually \u0091knowledgeable\u0092.\n\nThe current system of education consists of an very important element; the examination process. It simply requires a student\u0092s brain to be well armed with knowledge and facts. If a student gets a good mark, he or she is praised. Praised by the student\u0092s peers, teachers and parents. However, if the student gets a bad mark, or either fail, he or she will not receive any praise, but is likely to receive criticisms from everyone. This happens because the education system pressures us to demonstrate our abilities, skills and aptitude. If it allowed us to admit our lack of knowledge, the failed student should not fear reprimands from his or her parents. In fact, the failed student will learn more valuable lessons from his or her mistake which cannot be taught any teacher. Because as people say, failure is our greatest teacher. However because the society establishes \u0091superiority\u0092 upon the academic performance of the student, the student will just end up grounded for a few days or so.\n\nThomas Edison, a revered inventor, is famous for receiving only small amount of education. He was kicked out of school from on early age, as the result of his incompatibility in learning. The education system then and now is the same in this respect, where it shuns the \u0091unable ones\u0092 and only highlights the \u0091able ones\u0092. As the result of the education system highlighting only the knowledgeable ones, a creative person like Edison was alienated from the social norm. Nobody around him encouraged Edison to admit his \u0091ignorance\u0092 and improve except for his mother. As the result, his creativity proliferated, providing light to the development of scientific technologies and to our living rooms.\n\nEven though many people in history demonstrate the fact that not only the \u0091knowledgeable\u0092 are capable of reaching their zenith of life, education system still carries on concentrating on the academic performance of students. Many students are pressured to absorb incessant pouring of information and facts while rarely encouraged to make valuable improvements by admitting their mistakes. The many students receiving this education do not have time to admit anything because they are just so busy learning logarithms, biology, and quantum physics.\n\n\n----\n\nThanks in advance :-) "}, {"date": "2011-06-14T08:16:45+00:00", "url": "http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/india/1162351-the-indian-thread-20.html", "messages": "\n                    Domain of class of 2016!\nBy tradition as an outgoing member I'm creating this thread for college related discussion for India class of 2016.\nGood luck guys! :)\n\nperfectpixie ('15)\n\nThe tradition continues:\n Indian Post #1\nIndian Post #2\nIndian Post #3\nIndian Post #4\nIndian Post #5\nIndian Post #6\nIndian Post #7\nIndian Post #8\nIndian Post #9\nIndian Post #10\nIndian Post #11\nIndian Post #12\nIndian Thread #13\nThe Indian Thread (TiT) # 14\nThe Indian Thread (TiT) # 15\nThe Indian Thread (TiT) # 16\n The Indian Thread # 17\n[url=http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/india/795885-indian-thread-tit-18-a.html[/url] The Indian Thread # 18[/url]\nNOTE: Old TiT 19 got deleted by moderator for too much unrelated talk.

Something may occur to make you regret your premature action.\" -Aaron Burr.\nDo you agree with Aaron Burr that it's wisest to put things off if you can?\n\nEssay:\n\n\"In a society where time is of supreme essence, we all can acknowledge that there isvery little time in our lives and very few hours in a day. It is common for people to complain that \"there are only 24 hours in a day\" as they scramble to get things done. As astudent, I can testify that yes, sometimes there just isn't enough hours in a day to do what I need and what I want. Other people, whether they be doctors, moms, or students, can also relate to this. But this sense of being overwhelmed and burdened by the activities in your to-do list is the result of a laziness that has crept up in the global community particularly among the younger generations. For as you will soon see, it is not that we have so few hours in a day, but rather we waste precious time performing activities that do not get things done.\n\nAs a rising junior, I have a number of experiences where I can vividly remember the overwhelming feeling of being burdened by a massive essay or project. There were times I felt like giving up because of the overwhelming obstacles that impeded me from finishing my assignment: time, magnitude of project, complexity of essay, or just simple \"brain-dead\" moments that many people experience once in a while. Unless my teacher was extremely cruel and made the paper due a day after he or she assigned it, you can most likely infer that I procrastinated in my responsibilities as a student. Why? Because, today, procrastination remains as an infamous, integral aspect of teenage-hood. It is absolutely common that there are other kids who also wait until 10:00 that night to finish a 15 page research paper due the next day. How do we procrastinate so much and so often? It is because we are being continually distracted by the more attractive and more fun activities such as sports, video games, books, and food. As a result of us wasting that one to four hours on, let's say, video games, when you calculate the amount of time wasted and the amoutn of time most projects are due, we are actually losing up to dozens of the valuable time we need when we're staying up 'till 2:00 AM to complete the assignment.\n\nAs you can see, procrastination can result in negative consequences such as getting a bad grade on an assignment to feeling over burdened and depressed by life, a sense that no high schooler- who is just stepping into the real, adult life- should feel. If we were to do things at a constant rhythm and using those hours to do our work, we'd be saving ourselves a lot of negative consequences that can be prevented. Now I am not perfect; there are times where I \"accidentally\" procrastinate on assignments. But from my experience, I am happier and more confident in not only my paper but also myself when I do things in their right time.\"\n\nAggh! So many mistakes!

Workload is kind of heavy--17 credits including labs and learning communities for 3 classes: biology, inorganic chemistry and computer science.  Classmates are mostly sophomores based on his incoming AP and placement test results.\n\nThe problem is, S currently has a C (!) in Chem despite doing all the reading, homework and prep quizzes (prep quizzes are extra credit), plus attending all classes and printing out all the notes beforehand so he can supplement during lectures (he sent me his 'Blackboard' results to 'prove' this).\n\nHe says the class quizzes are nothing like what they've been studying.  The prof told them first day there was a 50% fail rate for this class.  DH, who was a college professor a while back, says it's a weed-out class, but agrees that S, who got a 4 on his AP Chem test and an overall gpa 4.5, shouldn't be one of those who fail.\n\nRate My Professor for this guy is pretty grim with nearly everyone complaining about exactly what we're experiencing.  They also say talking to him makes no difference.  Most recommend getting a tutor who's had that class with that prof, although they say it only helps a little.  But S says he has no time for a tutor because of his schedule.\n\nIs there any advice we can give him?  DH says we should contact the department head, but that sounds like helicoptering to me (besides, word is this prof is retiring after this year, so one parent complaining isn't likely to make a difference in the way he teaches).\n\nS is actually second-guessing his Bio major because he's feeling like he won't make it through the chemistry requirements!  That happened many years ago to DH who dropped out of zoology because an advisor told him his math 'wasn't strong enough' which he says was the result of a bad TA teaching the class, but as a freshman he wasn't assured enough to plough ahead.\n\nAny and all ideas would be most welcome.  We've heard no complaints from S since he left here a month ago until this, so it feels like we should do something or at least give him some suggestions.

I am US citizen living in Europe (was born and raised there) and I'm now taking gap year after graduating from high school to prepare my US applications (such as do the ACT's etc).\n\nEveryone on this site is so extremely helpful and I was wondering if you could help me out  once again and answer a few questions regarding the University of Southern California. For the longest time I wasn't allowed to apply to any schools in CA. My mother was born and raised in San Diego but since then, her whole family has relocated to the East Coast. As a result she's always felt that having her son be in California whilst the rest of the family was either on the East Coast or Europe, would be far too risky (for me and for her as a parent). After spending many summers in California when I was young, it's always been my dream to study there and recently I convinced my parents to let me apply to a few private schools and see what happens. My mother spoke very highly of USC while I was growing up and indadvertedly made me fall in love with the school and now that I'm given the chance, I've decided to go ahead and apply.\n\nSo now to get to the actual question, as some of you may know by my previous threads and posts on this forum, I'm also interested in double majoring/minoring in English Literature as well as Theatre. I emailed the USC theatre department and they told me that while it wasn't technically impossible to double major/minor in another subject, BFA students were usually discouraged due to the workload of the program. As a result, I looked into the BA (as well as the BFA) and will definitely apply to both programs. My questions is, for those who are attending USC, have children attending or know a lot about the program, in the BA are there a lot of acting classes available to the students? and are they allowed to audition for main-stage productions?\n\nAlso, I read on the site that I can submit a DVD audition, does anyone know when I have to send it in by?\n\nThank you for all the help and I apologize for the mini-autobiography in the middle there :D "}, {"date": "2011-11-05T21:05:58+00:00", "url": "http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/college-admissions/1237603-uk-applicant-questions.html", "messages": "\n                    I'm hoping to apply to some of the highly ranked colleges. Specifically, I am currently planning to apply to: Harvard, Yale, MIT, Stanford and Amherst. I did try searching for previous threads about a few issues that I've had, but haven't been able to find anything. I realise that I have a lot of questions, so if you can't answer them all, then I would appreciate your feedback on whichever ones you can answer.\n\nI also know that I'm aiming high. Quite simply, if I don't get into a college that offers complete financial support, I can't go. I'll study in the UK, where although probably higher, they will be covered by a government loan.\n\n1) The SAT reasoning test. From their websites, I got the impression that most of the colleges I'm applying to have a ~2100 cut-off for domestic students, yet most of the posts here seem to consider that the real cut-off is 2200-2300. How does this change for internationals? They say that extra consideration is given due to unfamiliarity with the test, yet there is more competition with international places. Will this go up or down?\n\n2) I am slightly concerned about my score. I took the test today, and I have the feeling that it did not go well. I am expecting 2000 - 2300 range, where on practice tests I was achieving 2250 - 2400. I got the impression that this test is administered to measure intelligence, so if I have done badly, is it possible to substitute an IQ test or to supplement my application with one? (I have a 1st percentile score, administered under exam conditions) I won't have the opportunity to retake the SAT before the application deadline, so this would be much more convenient.\n\n3) SATII / A-levels. Only Yale is willing to allow the substitution of A-levels for SAT subject tests. Does this mean that the other colleges will not properly consider them? I don't have many concerns about getting good scores in the SATII, but for applications to the UK A-levels are the deciding factor. I have fewer ECs because of the number of A-levels that I took last year. As a result, I know have A*Aaaa(A), with an A*A*A*A*a prediction, if that means anything to you  :) (By comparison, oxbridge admission offers are typically AAA - A*A*Aa). Will this be considered as a major factor in my application, or will my A-level results simply be used if I am considered to be borderline?\n\n4) ECs. I get the impression that the people who make admissions decisions have a list of 'deprived' areas and 'rich' areas, and have EC expectations to match. How does this work with international applicants? There an't many activities where I live, but I've tried to make the most of them. I am a member of many of the regional scientific societies, for example. However, even attending the lectures that these hold is a 3 hour round trip. Should I highlight this at the interview, in my application, or will they be aware that I live a fair distance from a city? (liverpool, which is 1 - 1.5 hours each way) Compared to my friends, the list of extra-curricular activities I do is extremely good, but I haven't won international competitions, and they don't really stack up to those that I've seen posted in these forums.\n\n5) Community service. As I mentioned earlier, ECs aren't a real factor in UK admissions. Therefore, I didn't do much community service. The closest I can think of for this ~30 hours of mentoring younger students. Is this going to be a major issue? Is there anything I can do about it?\n\n6) Visiting colleges. Separated by a trans-atlantic flight, it isn't very practical for me to visit the colleges that I want to apply for. Obviously, I intend to do so if I am offered a place, but will this go against me? My family has enough money that I could not have requested a fee waiver, if I lived in america, and that I will not be able to ask for application fees to be waived. However, we don't have enough to take multiple trips to the USA. Should I write this somewhere in the application?\n\n7) Essay. Can I re-use parts of my personal statement (this is a description of why we want to study the course that we've applied for, and an explanation of why the activities we do will help us on our course), or should I write them from scratch? I don't want to start writing them until I get my SAT results, will this be too late?\n\n8) Transcript. Due to the number of subjects that I studies last year, which was double the usual amount, my actual module scores are generally low. (high 80%s - low 90%s). I also received 2 Bs in general studies modules (which are not generally counted for admissions in the UK), and a D in a Maths module (with _very_ minor mitigating circumstances). Can I leave the module grades out too? Just leaving in the overall grades for each subject?

This is my first post after my friend in LA told me about this website at New Year's with the mandatory, \"OMG YOU DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT COLLEGE CONFIDENTIAL?\"\n\nI've taken in a lot of information that is now irrelevant to me as I am a senior in my high school. I go to a Canadian instuition and Texas Tech was a sort of last-minute decision on my part. My friend that attends TT has given me a virtual tour via photos and FaceTime, and it looks like a school that I am seriously interested in applying to. And here are where I cannot find any answers (then again I have terrible answer-seeking skills).\n\n1. I'm from Vancouver, BC, Canada. I'm Asian and there's a huge Asian community here. Though considered a \"minority,\" this is not actually the case and I do not get any benefits whatsoever. From what I can gather, Texas is a very Caucasian heavy state - will I face and discrimination, and / or benefit as a result of being a minority? Or will this put me at a DISadvantage?\n\n2. When's the darn deadline? I've been last-minute applying to UCLA, UC: Irvine, USC, NYU, and now Texas Tech on top of seven schools in Canada and the UK. I vaguely remember a January 4th, 2012 deadline, but on the ApplyTexas.org it says the deadline is April 1st?!?!?!\n\n3. Related to the previous question, does this mean that the university will give out admissions based on a first-come, first-serve sort of basis, or will admissions results be released after April 1st? That's when most schools release their admission results... I can't imagine that Texas Tech will start going through their applicant pool on the 1st of April.\n\nI'm sorry if I sound noobish and lazy. I'm sure that this kind of information is readily avaliable on the college websites as well as this one, perhaps. The only reason why I'm throwing a wild punch in the dark here is because I'm on a really tight time schedule. Applying to three countries, meeting requirements for all three, and keeping my GPA up is a hard task!\n\nI'd appreciate any help whatsoever.

By this reasoning I'm starting on a new bachelors degree (undergraduate) rather than continuing towards a masters degree (graduate).\n\n\nHope for a positive response.\n\n\nBest Regards\n\nAlexander_O\n\n\n\nPPS: I'm not saying no to actually having to start over again in the USA, seeing that I most likely could remove some of the studies/courses I already have (if that's in fact possible).\n\n "}, {"date": "2012-04-19T23:51:22+00:00", "url": "http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/act-preparation/1327255-score-higher.html", "messages": "\n                    Please post your scores and what you did to achieve them, also please share any links.\nI made this thread because some people are asking \" if you made a _____+ then please tell me what you did\" so if you have a score that you would like to share please post it and tell us what you did to get it.\n\nHere is mine :\n\nAs I mentioned in another thread, I'm currently a junior at Princeton (2370 SAT, 35 ACT, 234 PSAT) who ran his own test prep company in miniature this past summer and is thinking about taking this company full-time when I graduate. I posted another thread with my ideas on how test prep classes can be done well (since they can be done well) and asked for advice, but didn't list any of my strategies, which are a compilation of the ones I used myself, the ones I learned as an ACT instructor, and ones I've picked up randomly.\n\nGoing over the board, I noticed that there's currently a relative lack of ACT guides on this forum like Xiggi's and Silverturtle's guides on the SAT forum. One exception was FutureENTSurgeon's ACT guide, which I really liked for some things (English), but didn't find as useful on other things (Science).\n\nSo I thought I'd post my current method of teaching the ACT, which I think can be equally applied to learning the test independently. This way, I thought I could kill two birds with one stone: get some valuable feedback and maybe help a few people on the way.\n\nNote: It should be said that there are exceptions to every rule, and that no method is foolproof. My percentages are also approximate, and feel free to correct me. In the interest of space, this guide also doesn't attempt to go into every grammatical rule or every mathematical concept that is covered on the ACT, although I do cover those as part of my courses and tutoring, but confines itself to broad strategies.\n\nHere it goes:\n\nENGLISH:\n\n1. The shortest, simplest answer is usually the right one. This is because the ACT makers like to throw in a lot of extra junk to confuse you.\n\na. The literal shortest answer (fewest words) is right about 70% of the time. So it's not foolproof and not appropriate as a cure-all for someone who's shooting for a high score, but if you don't know the answer or are stuck between two, it's a great shorthand (since 70% is a lot better than the statistical 25% you'd get from randomly guessing or 50% you'd get from guessing between two).\n\nb. \"OMIT\" is right about 50% of the time (since nothing is always shorter than something).\n\nc. Don't add punctuation. Either leave it alone, change it (from a comma to a semi-colon, for instance), or take it out. Rarely do ACT questions have the problem of being too simple.\n\nd. If you can't understand what an answer choice is saying, it's probably wrong. A lot of people see an answer choice with a lot of words and punctuation and think \"Wow, that looks so complicated and smart. I can't even read it. It must be right.\" Give yourself more credit. You've read and understood a lot of edited, correct English getting up to this point in your life. If you can't understand it or have to read the answer choice three times to understand it, it's probably wrong.\n\ne. If an answer choice says the same thing twice or mentions something you think is completely unnecessary and off-topic, it's probably wrong for reasons of redundancy and irrelevancy, respectively. This will also fall under the \"shortest and simplest\" rule since the shortest and simplest answer will get rid of unnecessary things like this.\n\n2. If an answer choice is in the passive voice, it's wrong.\n\na. The grammatical definition of the passive voice is a sentence where the object (recipient of the verb; the one being taught, spoken to, written on, etc.) comes before the subject (the actor of the verb; the one teaching, speaking, writing, etc.). A sentence in the active voice, the correct way, will have the subject come before the object.\n\nPassive Example (BAD): The dog was walked by me.\nActive Example (GOOD): I walked the dog.\n\nb. While you will occasionally have to know part A for trickier \"passive voice\" questions, usually you can get away with a simple trick. Almost all passive voice answer choices have the word \"by\" somewhere in there. There are occasional legitimate uses for this word on the ACT, but they're few and far between. So if it has the word \"by\" in it, just mark it wrong.\n\nc. Be careful: due to its sometimes legitimate contexts, \"by\" isn't a word that naturally jumps out to us as wrong like \"ain't\" or \"I is\", and a lot of times we'll skim over it. Even after I teach my students this, they still miss occasional passive voice questions. Not usually because the method was wrong, but because they didn't see the word \"by\" since they were reading too fast/not being careful.\n\nd. It's also worth noting that this will generally tie in with Rule #1, since the active voice is usually shorter and simpler than the passive voice.\n\n3. Read answer choices \"aloud\" in your head and take advantage of your \"inner ear.\"\n\na. A lot of times, you won't be able to pinpoint the exact reason why an answer choice is right or wrong grammatically (\"Gee whiz, that's clearly a split infinitive\" or \"By golly, that's clearly a case of a superlative vs. comparative modifier.\"), but you'll be able to tell that it \"just sounds wrong.\" This is from years of reading correct English in books and magazines as well as hearing correct English on television. The inner ear won't usually kick in if you simply \"read\" it, so take the extra 2 seconds per answer choice and read it \"aloud\" in your head.\n\nb. Note: your inner ear isn't foolproof. This is due to our hearing the grammatically incorrect way in everyday speech. Common examples of this include the use of \"whom\" (which has a place grammatically even if people would look at you weird if you said this out loud) and the use of \"his or her\" rather than \"their\" (people almost always say \"their\" since it's shorter and easier to say, even though it's not always right).\n\n\nMATH:\n\nUnlike the other three sections, where you can improve by following a specific method or using broad strategies, there aren't any shortcuts with the Math. You improve in the Math mainly by doing practice problems, seeing why you got them wrong, figuring how to do it correctly and reworking the problems (this is crucial: take the time to rework the problem, rather than just thinking \"I got it\" and moving on), and then doing more problems. NO GUIDE IS A SUBSTITUTE FOR DOING MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF OFFICIAL ACT MATH PROBLEMS AND GOING OVER THE ONES YOU MISS APPROPRIATELY.\n\nThat being said, there are a couple of things that everyone can benefit from but not everyone uses.\n\n1. Do easy questions first, and don't shortchange them with time or effort.\n\na. All questions on the ACT are worth the same amount. But the ACT Math (the only section on the ACT to do this) also generally goes from easy questions to hard questions, with the first 20-ish being \"gimme questions\" (if you know the concept being tested, you'll easily get the question right), 21-ish to 45 or 50-ish being \"medium difficulty questions\" (they'll throw an extra complication into the problem, or try to trick you, but nothing too hard), and the last 10 or 15 being \"hard questions\" (the most difficult questions: many people won't even get to these or will have to guess on most of them; for you high scorers out there, these will be what make or break you).\n\nb. Because people are worried about time, they tend to rush through the easy questions at the beginning, making simple mistakes that could have been avoided, in order to get to the harder ones at the end. Don't make this mistake and miss out on easy points due to carelessness.\n\n2. To parrot your annoying math teacher, show your work! Write down the steps as you work them, draw out the graph, shape, etc. Use your calculator. You don't get cool points for doing everything in your head and you don't have anyone to impress. The best test-takers know they are fallable and plan accordingly.\n\na. The main advantage of this is it minimizes silly mistakes like forgetting negative signs, misplacing decimal points, adding 4 and 8 to get 48, etc. It's a statistical fact that the majority of questions people miss aren't because they didn't know the material, but because they either misunderstood the question or made a silly mistake. For high scorers, it's an even higher fraction since they tend to know pretty much all of the concepts being tested.\n\nb. It also helps conceptually. When you can see a line or shape in front of you rather than being distracted with trying to visualize it, it's easier to focus on what you need to do. When you have an equation written down in front of you, you may not know how to solve the problem, but you may know what step to take first, which will often lead you to the next step and the next step until you've solved the problem. If you try to do it in your head, you'll often just be stuck.\n\n3. This is a secondary tip borrowed from Princeton Review's \"Joe Blogg\" style of test-taking. If you don't know the answer to a question and the question is in the medium/hard section of 21-60, don't guess an answer choice whose number appears in the question. This method clearly isn't foolproof, but I'd say it works the majority of the time and is certainly statistically better than the 20% you'd get from guessing (since there are 5 answer choices in the Math section and 4 everywhere else).\n\na. This method works in practice even while unsound in theory since ACT makers usually choose to put those choices in there just on the off-chance you'll see a familiar number and jump on it. They also tend to engineer the problems with this in mind so that someone with this faulty way of thinking/guessing won't get the right answer by sheer accident.\n\nb. I'd also stay away from simply averaging the numbers found in the question and guessing that choice, for the same reasons as above.\n\n\nREADING:\n\nIn my opinion, Reading is the hardest section to improve in, since it relies heavily on soft skills like reading speed. It also tends to have the most genuinely ambiguous questions (even though the test-makers claim there is a clear answer to every question) and the most unforgiving curve. It was my own lowest sub-score on my final offical ACT (33 on the Reading), even though it didn't start out the lowest (that honor goes to the Science).\n\nAnecdotally, this is one of the two sections (the other being the Science, to a lesser degree) where students tend to have trouble with time even after good preparation. Unlike Math, where you improve in speed the more you prepare (since you'll be more practiced, spending less time on questions you already knew before preparation and spending less time stuck on questions you formerly couldn't figure out, now that you can actually work them) or the English (where people very rarely have time problems), Reading speed is limited in large measure by your reading speed, appropriately enough.\n\nThat being said, I have gleaned a few tips from my own experience taking the test, teaching it, and reading various guides on sites like College Confidential.\n\n1. Don't waste your time reading the questions before you read the passage. Not only does this waste precious time, but your retention of the passage will be worse when you do read it since you'll be distracted from trying to keep all of those questions in your head.\n\n2. Don't read too slowly, but don't hurry too much either, or else you won't remember anything and will have wasted the time you did spend. I'd say 3 1/2 minutes is a good benchmark to shoot for that strikes the right balance between time management and understanding the passage. If you're a fast reader and can read the passage faster and remember it well, more power to you.\n\n3. Questions can generally be divided into two categories: fact-based (answer can be found in black-and-white in the passage) and interpretation-based (answer must be found \"between the lines\"), with about 2/3 being the former and 1/3 being the latter. There tend to be an even greater proportion of fact-based questions on the more fact-based Social Science and Natural Science passages, while the split is tends to more 50/50 on the Prose and Humanities passages. In my experience, performance on fact-based questions can be improved, but performance on interpretation-based questions is pretty strongly reliant on your natural ability to \"read between the lines.\" Either you see it or you don't. Try not to worry about the ones you don't and focus on the ones you do.\n\na. For the reasons I've detailed above, the Social Science and Natural Science passages tend to be easier for most people, but not for everyone.\n\nb. If you KNOW you won't have enough time to do all 4 passages, I'd do the passages from easiest to hardest, based on your personal preferences. This is because it's obviously better to have time to do the one you usually get 8 out of 10 on rather than the one you usually get 4 out of 10 on. But if you usually have extra time, barely finish, or almost finish (1 or 2 questions left), I'd recommend going and ahead and just doing the passages in order, since it won't be worth the mind game you're playing with yourself.\n\n4. To find answers faster and more accurately, I recommend the \"key word\" method. A lot of people try to re-read the passage for each question and find its answer. Not only does this waste a lot of time, it actually lessens your ability to actually pinpoint the answer's location since you don't really know what to look for. The \"key word\" method is detailed below.\n\na. Find a \"key word\" in the wording of the question. Don't pick a word like \"he\" or \"is\", for obvious reasons. Also, if the passage is on wildlife management, don't pick a word like \"wildlife\" or \"management.\" The reason for both of these is the same: the word will show up in a lot of contexts not related to the question or the answer.\n\nb. Instead, pick a word that seems unique to the question. For example, say you have a question like \"According to the passage, what is NOT a negative externality of wildlife management?\" A good key word would be \"externality\". Note: the actual wording in the passage may be something like \"externalities\", but will almost always be something either identical or very visually similar to your key word.\n\nc. Once you have your key word, quickly skim the passage for that specific word. If you're looking for a specific word, it will tend to jump out at you, making it easy.\n\nd. Once you've located the key word, start reading a little before it (a couple of sentences) and read until a little after it. This is called \"being aware of context\" and the ACT-makers will often put the answer before or after where the answer's subject mentioned explicitly to make sure you're being circumspect.\n\ne. It's also worth noting that the key word may show up several times in the passage, and the answer may not always show up in the first instance every time. Don't give up if you don't see it, and don't waste a lot of time re-reading the same bit over and over if you've already followed part d.\n\n5. Correct answers tend to be moderate in both tone and belief. So if an answer choice could be viewed as offensive or extreme, it's probably not right. Buzzwords to watch out for include \"always,\" \"never,\" \"perfectly,\" and other absolutes like them. An answer choice containing those words probably isn't right.\n\n6. If you've done the strategies I recommend and are still having problems with time, I recommend trying speed reading, even though it doesn't work for everyone. There are many forms of speed reading, and it's difficult to explain in writing, but my best attempt goes like this:\n\na. People tend to read slowly not because they are inherently slow readers, but because they get distracted, especially with boring ACT passages. Their eyes lose their place, they start to think about other things, they slow down and then speed up artificially, and so on.\n\nb. To help focus the eyes, maintain mental focus, and enforce a certain reading speed, trace under the line you're currently on at a steady speed you want to read at. Don't make your pencil follow your eyes: that will just distract you. Instead, take advantage of the fact that our brains are evolutionarily wired to notice moving objects: your eyes will be \"bothered\" by the moving pencil and will be naturally drawn to it. To speed up reading, simply move your pencil faster.\n\nc. Don't underestimate the mental advantage of doing this. Doing this puts you in \"ACT mode\", reminding you why you're here and keeping you focused.\n\nd. I've had mixed results with this. Some people cut their passage reading time from 6 minutes to 3 minutes, giving them 12 extra minutes over 4 passages that they can now spend answering the questions. I had one guy go from a 21 to a 29 on the Reading using this tactic. More typical improvement is from 4 1/2 minutes to 3 1/2 minutes, bringing about an estimated 2 point improvement, with the other 2 points (my students' average improvement is 4 points) coming from the other strategies I've listed. Anecdotally, I'd say it helps about 60% of people. But if you're already reading at a pace of 3 1/2 minutes per passage or faster, or if this method just distracts you and slows you down, I wouldn't bother with it. There is no question that while this method helps most people, it does hurt some people, and you should follow your best judgment.\n\n\nSCIENCE:\n\nScience is probably the section least like the subject that bears its name, at least on the surface. In reality, it's less physics and chemistry and more \"interpreting tables/charts/graphs/etc.\" mixed with a bit of \"compare these two scientists/students/etc.\" as a Science version of reading comprehension.\n\nThere are three types of passages in the Science section. You do the first two one way and the last a different way.\n\n1. Data Representation (3 of these, 5 questions each): almost entirely charts/graphs/etc. with few words. Tend to be the most straightforward.\n\n2. Research Summaries (3 of these, 6 questions each): paragraphs mixed with charts/graphs/etc. Tend to revolve around several experiments that you have to examine in isolation and in comparison with one another.\n\n3. Conflicting Viewpoints (1 of these, 7 questions): two or three short passages written by \"students\", \"scientists\", etc. They all talk about the same topic, but have different stances on a key issue.\n\nHere are my strategies for the first two:\n\n1. Read the short blurb at the top of the page to get a very vague, general idea of what you're dealing with, and then go straight to the questions. Not only does this save time, but it reinforces the central theme of taking the Science successfully: the focus isn't on understanding the material, but on just answering the questions correctly.\n\n2. Don't try to understand the material beyond what you absolutely have to. It wastes time and will usually needlessly confuse you. The ACT makers don't expect you to be an expert on engines, pendulums, lightning, or God knows what (as can be seen by the fact that comprehension isn't necessary to answer the questions correctly), so you shouldn't either.\n\n3. Even in the Research summaries passages, the vast majority of questions will be found in the charts/graphs/tables/etc., so spend your time there. Only if you can't find it there (and sometimes you won't) should you look to the paragraphs.\n\n4. Watch out for the little things. This is the main trademark of high scorers in the Science: they are careful. Most questions people miss have to do with little things like negative signs (-100 is not less than -500, it's greater), not noticing differences in decimal places or scientific notation between different numbers, automatically assuming that the two things next to one another in a table are what you should be comparing, assuming that the table is in order of least to greatest or vice versa, and so on. Take the time to be careful.\n\n5. Take the time to memorize the simple graphs and what they mean about the data they're representing. These include positive slopes, negative slopes, flat lines, vertical lines, \"peaks\" (line goes up then down; these lines look like mountain peaks), \"valleys\" (line goes down then up; these lines look like valleys as well as the letter \"v\"), exponential-based curve (slope keeps increasing), and the limit curve (slope keeps decreasing, or trending toward a specific flat line). These kinds of graphs all tell you something about their data. Not only will you have to sometimes have to choose between several graphs, but it can also help you with random problems to quickly draw the data's overall trend.\n\nHere are my strategies for the last kind:\n\n1. The 2 or 3 passages will be the same except that they differ in opinion on 1 or 2 key issues. These 1 or 2 main points can almost always be found in the first sentence of the first paragraph and the last sentence of the last paragraph. This isn't an accident: it has to do with where the ACT makers believe the thesis and the conclusion, respectively, should be placed.\n\n2. Don't try to hurry and just underline these two sentences. Take the time to re-write in shorthand, in your own words, what each is saying. Not only does this provide an easy place to refer to for the numerous questions that refer to these main topics, but it also forces you to understand what it's saying and prevents you getting screwed later. Do this for the 2 points in passage 1, then the 2 points in passage 2, etc.\n\n3. There may not be a second main point, so don't spend a lot of time trying to find the hidden point in the last sentence if one isn't immediately apparent. A good way to tell if something is a main point or not is that a main point will show up in all of the passages (\"Tornadoes break windows because of X\" \"Tornadoes break windows because of Y\" etc.), due to the Science section's design.\n\n4. As for reading the passages in full, it's up to you. There will be some questions that ask about specific details in the body of the passage, but these can usually be located easily and are pretty obvious. If you're fine on time, I'd recommend reading them for peace of mind's sake, but I wouldn't worry if you're pressed on time and want to skip it.\n\n\n\nSo there you have it! Thanks for reading and I hope you gleaned a few tips. Do you have any suggestions for me?

Whether it was from comparing or contrasting one thing or another, he would always tell me the same thing. It is people\u0092s nature to compare themselves with others in order to appreciate what they truly have. Recent Disney Pixar movie Brave\u0092s  main character realizes how much she should have appreciated her mother after comparing with one of her ancestor. Several examples from film and personal experience show the need for people to compare themselves with others to appreciate what they have.\n\nDemonstrated by the problem Princess Mediath had to face, the only method for people to appreciate what they have right now is to compare themselves with that of others. In the beginning of the movie, it shows a daughter and a mother constantly fighting. Her mother, the Queen, does not  believe princesses should be playing with bows and arrows. She forcibly try to obliterate her tomboyness. One night, the Queen proposed that it is time for the Mediath to find a man. The Queen did everything the princess didn\u0092t want to do, ending the opening ceremony night with an argument and a princess running to a witch. Mediath told the witch she needed a potion that could change her mother. The result was just a piece of cake. Mediath rushed home to make her mother eat the cake, which turned her mother into a bear. After days of finding a cure, she accidentally meets up with another ferocious bear, who did  the exact same thing Mediath did with her mother. Comparing the two lives and the results of the angry bear, she finally appreciates her mother regardless of her firm and feminine ways. This shows that one of the only ways people can learn to appreciate what they have is to compare with someone else\u0092s results.\n\nAnother example of how comparisons can allow one to enjoy the current things one have would be from experience. When I was young I always thought I had the most terrible life out of every one of my best friends. My mother was divorced. I\u0092m not rich. I don\u0092t travel to Asia every summer. And so on. This belief continued to middle school, until my mom remarried. When she remarried, we moved across the country to a new state and home. While I was trying to \u0093bond\u0094 with my new stepfather, we started talking about best friends. He, too, had the same belief that he was the poorest and worst life out  of everyone else. I didn\u0092t realize it at first, so I tried to make him feel better by comparing it to the poor kids who lost their parents in an earthquake or other disasters. By being relative and being compared to someone else made both him and me realize how our lives don\u0092t really stink as bad as we believe it to be. This, again, demonstrates how relativity and comparing to others can help people appreciate what they have in life.\n\nDemonstrated by several examples in film and personal experience, life actually does not suck  as bad as  we may believe it may be. For example, true I am poor, but at least I have a family who supports me on my goals in life. Princess Mediath learned the hard way after losing her mother. Like my stepfather always said, It\u0092s all relative!

Antagonistic forces, approaches, and ideas clash, resulting in something more beautiful, more worthy, more satisfying.\n\n\nNow that the ecstasy (or perhaps more accurately, the endorphins) has (have) largely worn off, I can contemplate the past without the rose-colored glasses I had previously donned, and the red-ink dipped pen I had previously used. Perhaps the third time will be the charm.\n\n\nAfter all, I\u0092ve already experienced the thesis - a short fling - fun, but overall an utter failure on my part. The antithesis - this spin about - was much more satisfying, but my current, acute, and stinging awareness of all the words that were left unsaid, all the words that should have been said, all the actions that remained thoughts, and all the actions I should have taken back and sincerely apologized for, makes it clear that I still have a tremendous amount of growth to experience. It may seem paradoxical that the clash of antagonistic experiences can result in something better, but it is the summation of the positive and the excision of the negative that results in that something which is better.\n\n\nI cannot help but burst into fits of laughter when reflecting over my myopic decisions. These were not the decisions of a rational being but ones of a desperate being. One with a pathological sense of self-consciousness. One with an inability to fully assert his will at all times. One with the complete inability to empathize. One with a completely deluded sense of self-importance. A selfish and passively demanding being. A narcissistic one too, both then - and now. And one with a horrible taste in birthday presents.\n\n\nHowever laughable my former enterprise is, it is still a major event in my life. But to her, I am just a footnote. A random high school student who took a sudden predilection, and one with an aptitude not for calculus but for stalking (or is it coincidence)? Major, because to me, it is the negation to my initial thesis.\n\n\nHow pathetic am I? I\u0092m just a footnote. Deservedly relegated to the annals of history. I cannot believe that I elicited so much courtesy, so much tolerance. And I pathetically try to relive the past through blasting love songs over Spotify and writing numerous essays (many of which deservedly never see the light of day) in which I embed not-so-subtle references to my exploits (if one requires an example, the last sentence of the fourth paragraph is a case-in-point).\n\n\nThere is something comforting about being listened to (or read) by others. There is something comforting about being read by the anonymous yet teeming millions. It is a sort of validation. I take the spotlight of the stage. The production? Another one of IceQube\u0092s superficial essays in High School Life. The actor? Pathetic IceQube himself. Just another stupid actor, who frets his hour upon the stage, with the entire audience wishing that he\u0092d disappear and be seen no more. And perhaps my audience is not so anonymous \u0085 although I don\u0092t generally reveal the true identity of IceQube - the man behind the genius* - to others, I have revealed who I am to one of my female classmates.\n\n\nPerhaps she\u0092s reading this essay right now, and laughing one of her appendages off at my acute self-awareness, and understanding all of the references I\u0092ve dropped - she was, after all, one of my accomplices - a partner-in-crime. I actually wouldn\u0092t mind if she reads this essay. After all, I have bared intimate parts of myself here - I\u0092ve bared parts of my inner psyche. And as we\u0092ve discussed on another thread, secrets about oneself can strengthen bonds; they are revealing, and divulging them necessitates a certain level of trust in the other party.\n\n\nUltimately, I now have experience under my belt - figuratively, of course. Third time\u0092s the charm, too, right? So if you\u0092re in the market for an amiable man with not only a great smile but also an unusually deft hand for penning romantic letters and erudite essays \u0085 let\u0092s meet :).

I went to the audiologist a few months later and test results came back saying that i had permanent mild-moderate hearing loss. I applied for my school's disability office and got accepted. I sent my appeal letter describing this in detail along with the disability office documents, hearing test results, and a letter from my audiologist. Would this reasoning qualify to get my scholarship renewed for the year?

Note that this figure is actual received donations this year; including pledges, which are typically spread out over time, it raised $1.2b. For context:\n\n* besides Stanford and Harvard, only 6 universities have broken $450 million in a single year (only once each): Yale, Penn, Columbia, UW-Madison, UCLA, and USC. By contrast, Stanford hasn't dropped below $450 million in over a decade.\n\n* Stanford and Harvard are the only two to break $600 million.\n\n* Stanford is the only one to break $700 million, which it has done five times. It has broken the $800m mark three times, the $900m mark twice, and the $1 billion mark once, this last year.\n\n* while other universities haven't released their FY2012 fundraising totals yet, it's likely that Stanford will continue its streak of being the top fundraising institution in the world, for the 8th year in a row.\n\n* in the last 12 years, there hasn't been a single year that Stanford wasn't running a (formal) fundraising campaign - also a record. From 2000-2005, the Campaign for Undergraduate Education surpassed its $1.1 billion goal. From 2006-2011, the Stanford Challenge raised $6.23 billion, far surpassing the next largest campaign ($3.9 billion set by Yale) and averaging a record $1.25 billion per year in pledges over the five-year campaign. Its original goal was to raise $4.3 billion, which it reached in 2009, two years ahead of schedule (despite the economic crisis). In 2012, it launched the Campaign for Stanford Medicine, a $1 billion campaign that already has more than $500 million in pledges and gifts. So during Hennessy's 12-year tenure, Stanford has raised more than $8 billion in pledges and gifts - a total that surpasses the endowments of all but four other institutions.\n\n* because of strong donations in the last year of the campaign, Stanford's endowment in FY2012 rose 3.2% to $17 billion, despite a sluggish economy (esp. internationally). By contrast, Harvard's dropped $1 billion to $30.7 billion, and Yale's dropped slightly from $19.4b to $19.3b. Stanford's merged pool, which includes additional funds that act as endowment but are not legally included as such, rose to $19.7b.\n\nOther impressive facts:\n\n* Stanford was the first university to set a fundraising goal over $1 billion, which was considered ambitious/unlikely; the largest at that point was Columbia's $475 million. The Centennial Campaign, launched in 1987, finished in 1992 with $1.3 billion.\n\n* due to a perennial dominance in fundraising and to strong investment returns, the gap between Stanford's and Harvard's endowments has been cut in half in only the last 14 years.\n\n* while Stanford doesn't have the largest endowment today, it does have the largest unrestricted endowment (i.e. no-strings-attached funds that can be spent at the discretion of the university), with $6.6 billion in FY2011, or 40% of its overall endowment. Harvard has $5.6b, Yale $2.9b. The margin is greater with unrestricted net assets (which include non-endowment assets, minus liabilities): Stanford at $11.2b in FY2011, Harvard at $8.8b, and Yale at $3.6b. Also in FY2011, Stanford had $32 billion in consolidated assets, and $25b in net assets. [The figures for FY2012 have not yet been released.]\n\n* the total of university, hospital, and capital budgets is approximately $7 billion this year, making Stanford's operating budget again the largest of any institution in the world. On a budget-per-capita basis, the gap between Stanford and its nearest competitors widens even more.\n\nAverage donations among top fundraising institutions, 2003-2011:\n1. Stanford: $677m\n2. Harvard: $598m\n3. JHU: $395m\n4. Columbia: $391m\n5. USC: $382m\n6. Yale: $378\n7. Cornell: $372\n8. Penn: $359m\n9. UCLA: $349m*\n\nAverage on a per-capita basis* (average donations divided by # alumni):\n1. Stanford: $3563\n2. MIT: $2396\n3. JHU: $2324\n4. Yale: $2259\n5. Harvard: $1851\n6. Cornell: $1431\n7. USC: $1273 ($1592 with 240k alumni)\n8. Columbia: $1261\n9. Penn: $1249\n\n* Duke and Princeton don't make the list in absolute fundraising, but on a per-capita basis would be around Cornell's figure.\n\nSources:\nStanford Management Company releases 2012 results\nFinances: Stanford University Facts\nhttp://bondholder-information.stanford.edu/pdf/AR_FinancialReview_2011.pdf\nBudget 1998-99: President Rodin's Report to University Council- Almanac, Vol. 45, No. 31, 5/4/99\nWith $1.1 billion and counting, key capital campaign surpassed goals\nThe final tally: Centennial Campaign raised $1.269 billion\nhttp://provost.unc.edu/announcements/srlevelbrief2012/adv\n\nTop fundraising totals 2003-2011:\nhttp://www.cae.org/content/pdf/VSE-PressRelease2004.pdf\nTop Fundraising Colleges and Universities,in Total Amount Raised, 2004 \u2014 Infoplease.com\nhttp://www.cae.org/content/pdf/VSE2005SurveyPRwithTables.pdf\nStanford Tops Harvard, Yale With $911 Million in Private Gifts - Bloomberg\nhttp://talk.collegeconfidential.com/college-search-selection/463839-top-fundraisers-2006-07-a.html\nhttp://www.cae.org/content/pdf/VSE_2008_Survey_Press_Release_with_Tables.pdf\nhttp://www.cae.org/content/pdf/Top_Twenty_and_By_State_2009.pdf\nhttp://talk.collegeconfidential.com/college-search-selection/1081870-top-fundraisers-2010-a.html\nTop 20 fundraising universities - CBS News "}, {"date": "2012-11-24T15:46:57+00:00", "url": "http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/sat-preparation/1420264-give-my-essay-a-quick-grade.html", "messages": "\n                    Took essay under a timed constraint of exactly 25 minutes.\n\n\n\n\nPrompt : Are people's lives the result of the choices they make?

Support your position with reasoning and examples taken from your reading, studies, experience, or observations.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe lives of people are not the direct result of their own choices. Rather the choices of others, typically their superiors, affect one's life. Literary works, such as \"Ender's Game\" and \"To Kill a Mockingbird\", epitomize this notion.\n\n\"Ender's Game\" follows the tale of Ender Wiggin, a boy who's life had been planned for him by the government, years before he was born. Ender Wiggin was genetically enhanced at birth to give him extreme intelligence. He is then forcibly removed from his family at the tender of age of 8. The government enrolls him in a special academy, one that will train him to become a commander for an upcoming war. During his time at the school, government officers quietly manipulate Ender, in order to challenge him. One such example is when Officer Brian, a government operative, bribes Ender's contemporaries/peers to bully him incessantly. Ender makes the choice eventually to fight back against his tormentors. But Ender's decision to do so was carefully manipulated by officials. At the end of the novel, Ender is given a simulation test. IN the test, he is to command an army of soldiers against an unknown foe. The protagonist is able to defeat the computer generated foes eventually. However, the novel ends with Ender being told that the simulation he completed was actually real. Thus the tale of a boy manipulated his entire life ends. Other novels also examine how the life of a person is controlled by others.\n\n\"To Kill a Mockingbird\" is a novel by Harper Lee that examines the results of unjust racism. Tom Robinson is a simple and honest man who always tries to be helpful. One day he passes by the house of Mayella Ewell. He is invited in the house by Mayella because she claims that she needs him to move something. However once inside, she attempts to sleep with him. Tom rebuffs these advances quickly because he is a married man. In jealously, Mayella accuses Tom of rape. Mr. Robinson is then tried in court in front of an all white jury. Despite the compelling arguments of his lawyer Atticus Finch, Tom is unjustly declared guilty by the clearly biased jury and sentenced. to life in prison. Tom's entire life is stolen from him just because of a jealous woman and a biased jury. His moral actions had no effect whatsoever on his life.\n\n\"To Kill a Mockingbird\" and \"Ender's Game\" show that the actions of a person do not his/her life; the actions of others do.

While ostensibly, having things in common within a group would bring harmony, it actually would be detrimental and cause the members to become insular. Opposing views are crucial to maintain balance in a group. Belligerent groups in World War II exhibit the danger of having groups in which the members all have something in common.\nDuring World War II, many parties experienced groupthink. Groupthink occurs in a group of people who share the same views and see only one side of a situation. Any deviation from the group's accepted ideas would be take as disloyalty and a disruption of the group's harmony. This became an issue during the fog of war when many people forgot their morals and committed atrocities. When the United States was affected by group think, the people who dealt with military mattes dropped two devistating atomic bombs on Japan. The result of the groups unanimous desire to win the war was a travesty for hundreds of thousands of innocent Japanese civilians. Since everyone in the group agreed that drastic measures could be taken if needed to win the war, there were no checks to the action, and the results were deleterious.\nMultiple views should be offered in a group to provide checks and balances, and people should not only belong to groups in which all members agree. The tragic results of groupthink show that opposition is needed to maintain balance. With some disagreement, the world can exist in harmony                "}, {"date": "2013-01-19T13:03:37+00:00", "url": "http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/financial-aid-scholarships/1449151-fafsa-help.html", "messages": "\n                    So I recently submitted a FAFSA and I got the results as 00000 EFC.

This anomaly threw a massive wrench into what many people had always assumed was the sole source of success\u0097IQ. Decades of research now point to emotional intelligence as the critical factor that sets star performers apart from the rest of the pack.\n\nEmotional intelligence is the \u0093something\u0094 in each of us that is a bit intangible. It affects how we manage behavior, navigate social complexities, and make personal decisions that achieve positive results. Emotional intelligence taps into a fundamental element of human behavior that is distinct from your intellect. There is no known connection between IQ and emotional intelligence; you simply can\u0092t predict emotional intelligence based on how smart someone is. Intelligence is your ability to learn, and it\u0092s the same at age 15 as it is at age 50. Emotional intelligence, on the other hand, is a flexible set of skills that can be acquired and improved with practice. Although some people are naturally more emotionally intelligent than others, you can develop high emotional intelligence even if you aren\u0092t born with it.\n\nHow much of an impact does emotional intelligence have on your professional success? The short answer is: a lot! It\u0092s a powerful way to focus your energy in one direction with a tremendous result. TalentSmart tested emotional intelligence alongside 33 other important workplace skills, and found that emotional intelligence is the strongest predictor of performance, explaining a full 58% of success in all types of jobs.\n\nYour emotional intelligence is the foundation for a host of critical skills\u0097it impacts most everything you say and do each day. Emotional intelligence is the single biggest predictor of performance in the workplace and the strongest driver of leadership and personal excellence.\n\n\n\nNumbers are very important but ARE NOT deal breakers! (lots of people say that but now I have 4 paragraphs explicitly explaining it. Actually, 7,780,000 Google results!).\n\nNow we have a new unresolved issue:\nSurviving this whole month until Pi Day!\nAnd YES, I am 100% sure there is no such thing as Pi Day Intelligence!

Both of us, even back then, knew many who got \"rejected\" that year who got into \"better\" schools.  This is nothing new.\n\nWhy? Because Cal Poly is part of the California State University system.  What Cal Poly can ask for from an applicant (by law) is limited.  Furthermore the school is required to take a percentage of applicants from the local area - a constraint the UCs don't have (I am informed that Cal Poly has gotten more discretion on that requirement recently but that it still exists).   So if you got \"rejected\" realize that the school had limited information (did you notice the application at Cal Poly was shorter than MIT's?)\n\nSo why is Cal Poly a hard school to get into?  Cal Poly's emphasis (since inception) is to provide practical undergraduate educations for the workforce rather than the lab.  With the economy being where it is a degree from Cal Poly is now worth a lot more than a degree from a lot of \"better\" schools.  Yes - a brilliant, newly minted Cultural Anthropologist from Stanford may be interesting to talk to at a party but the Cal Poly Engineer on the other side of the room is probably making a lot more money.  (Both my parents, along with two siblings, have Stanford degrees so I have special dispensation to give Stanford a hard time).\n\nWhy is Cal Poly not \"prestigious?\"  Because it is in the CSU system.  Once you have gone there and been in the workforce for a few years \"where you went to school\" matters little  (unless you work in Washington DC).  I take pride in people under-rating Cal Poly - from a career standpoint it is good to have people underestimate you so you consistently exceed expectations.  Unfortunately most of corporate America has discovered Cal Poly so the secret is out.  At least it means Cal Poly grads get hired with solid salaries on strong advancement opportunities (again - this is why Cal Poly is hard to get into).  As for prestige, the school has made an effort to expand out of state admissions. As much as that will bother California taxpayer-parents whose kids did not get in, Cal Poly fashioned this expansion  so that these out of state students would pay much more to attend so as to subsidize in-state students.  That's the theory.  The result will be a wider reputation for the school.  So the \"secret\" about Cal Poly may soon be lost nationwide.\n\nWhy is Cal Poly worth transferring into?  Well - ask yourself this simple question: \"Why am I going to college?\"  If the answer centers on social/cultural/\"get away from mom and dad\" type answers then Cal Poly is not worth transferring into - go to a 4 year school, wear the colors, go to the parties and get the full college experience.  Most kids end up loving where they went to school, regardless of who \"rejected\" them.  However, if your answer is \"I am determined to be the best [fill in technical profession here] and Cal Poly will ensure I get a great start\" then work on transferring in.  How? It is a CSU school - transferees from the adjacent zip codes get a little more love than others.  Go and enroll at Cuesta (San Luis Obispo) or Allan Hancock (Santa Maria) and bust your butt to get strong grades.  Each school has a specialist in their administration for getting people into Cal Poly (I kid you not - check it out).\n\nNow - how to get in: some tips for applicants (both freshman and transfer) -\n\n1) actually care about your field of study.  Cal Poly requires a declaration on your application because these are vocationally oriented degree programs that require 4 to 5 years to complete.  The school does not short change students of a specialty by giving them 2 years to decide what to do when you grow up.  Those are 2 years lost.  If you have a demonstrated vocational interest you have an advantage.  Why? See the next paragraph.\n\n2) unlike just about every other university you are applying to, Cal Poly admission decisions are made by the department you are applying to.  Think about that for a minute.  Go to the Cal Poly website, find the department that grants the degree you are applying to and actually look at the faculty who are there.  They will decide if you get in.  The people in admissions collect the applications and organize them for those people (of course, admissions may have been told \"don't send us anything with a [fill in number here] SAT score or lower\").  Take a good look at what those faculty members think is important - how they want to impact their field of study.  Having done that, consider taking a trip to the university - contact your department head or a faculty member (politely - use the department secretary) and ask if you can have a brief chart to learn more about the program.  If you are smart (hint, hint) actually find where you share an earnest interest with said department head or faculty member and set about sharing that interest.  They remember faces and remember names.  That benefits you *IF* you make that *earnest* connection - if you are just playing at it they will sniff you out in a few seconds and they know you will want out of the program 1 year in.\n\nSame goes for clubs - go to Open House (formerly Poly Royal) and check out the clubs from your department.  There will probably be a faculty adviser standing with the students. If you are actually interested in what the club does share that interest with the students and adviser.  Again - when faculty are sitting around a conference table trying to pick the top 20% out of a pile of applications one may just remember YOU from that interaction and put your app in the 20%.  For them it is one step closer to getting that tiresome task of selecting applicants done.\n\n3) send extra information where you can.  Taking your AP tests and Cal Poly doesn't require them? Send them anyway.  Your GPA may have been inflated (or deflated) based on your school's grading culture.  AP scores are standardized.  A decision maker would rather use the standardized metric even if it wasn't required of all applicants.\n\n4) realize that some departments are more impacted than others.  That is reality.  Be careful - don't make a decision you will regret by going into a field you despise simply to \"get in.\"  If you want to be a Business major don't apply for Natural Resource Management thinking that you will just change majors once you arrive.  You have to maintain excellent grades in BOTH fields of study to facilitate such a transfer which means loading up on units (which makes the high grades hard to achieve).\n\nAnyways  -  I have said enough and if you got this far you are to be congratulated.  I hate to see people feel unjustly \"rejected\" from Cal Poly.  Understand this - those making the decisions have very little information to go on. Cal State Universities were not designed to be highly selective, yet Cal Poly is and will remain in the Cal State system (I pray the UC system never takes it over and ruins it).

Perhaps there is more than ancedotal information here.\n\n-\n\nKevin, most of the states that love the ACT are blue states... MN, WI, MI tend to lean Democrat. MN hasn't voted for a Republican since what, Hoover? They were the only state (and DC) to vote for Mondale/Ferraro.\n\nThe truth is the SAT is being dumbed-down, since it is designed to compare students to the average of their peers. Therefore the average just keeps dropping. The ACT is based on actual knowledge needed for college, and so if an entire generation is undereducated, the ACT will reflect this with low scores. That's why the ACT is so popular near Iowa, where it was created. The coasts just can't accept that the ACT is far superior since it was invented in \"fly-over country.\"\n\nNonetheless, the reason that the *average* scores keep dropping is that more disadvantaged students are taking the tests, which is actually a good thing. If you look at SAT scores *within* each major racial/ethnic group (White, Black, Hispanic, Asian-American), you find that *within* each group, SAT scores are on the rise. However, the average scores for Black and Hispanic students are lower overall (although rising annually), and since Black and Hispanic test-takers are increasing in percent, the OVERALL average drops while test scores for each race is rising. In reality, EVERYONE is getting smarter, but changes in the proportions of different sub-populations skews the average and makes for confusing results.\n\nBottom line: lower average test scores is actually a GOOD thing. Averages can lie.\n\n-\n\nMy thoughts were the exact opposite; I believed that, in general, the SAT was the \"blue\" test, and that the ACT was the \"red\" test. I was convinced I was wrong when I read this:\n\nhttp://www.arthurhu.com/99/06/satact.txt\n\nYes, it's outdated by about six or seven years. The point is that the coastal Southern states, which are generally Republican, prefer the SAT, whereas the Upper Midwest states, which are usually Democrat, favour the ACT.\n\nThere is one minor anomaly, and a glaring one: Arizona and Indiana, respectively. The former is technically within the Rockies, but unlike them, it leans towards the SAT. (Must be the California transplants.) The latter is completely surrounded by ACT states, and is somehow inclined towards the Republican party.\n\nIn addition, it seems that the most populous states use the SAT more. California, New York, Texas, Florida, Pennsylvania, but not Illinois (nor Ohio nor Michigan). Really, if there is to be a logical consistency between population and SAT/ACT preference, Illinois and Indiana should switch places. Or perhaps it's because Illinois houses Chicago, \"the most American city of all\". (I'll explain what that means in the next paragraph.)\n\nBasically, the reason I used to think the SAT was for donkeys and the ACT was for elephants was that the Dems stress globalisation, and that the GOP insists on nationalism. Non-Americans have free access to the SAT, whereas that is (generally?) not the case with the ACT. Of course, it is called \"The American College Test\" for a reason.\n\n*takes a deep breath*\n\nHere's one more link:\n\nhttp://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/states/USCHARTsat.html\n\nSo, what are your thoughts on this?

This is a summary of my visit.\n\n1. Academics: Pratt is one of the oldest stand alone art schools in the US dating back to 1888. It is certainly the biggest art school with almost 4,000 students ( about half are undergraduate).  It is widely considered to  be one of the best art and design programs in the country. Many of their programs are ranked in the top 10 such as Interior Design, Archtecture,Industrial Design and Communication Design to name just a few. Pratt has an amazing number of majors and offerings. For example, you can major in Communication Design that has three different concentrations ( writing, illustration, and graphic design). They are also one of the only Computer Graphic Programs around with 4 different emphasis such as 2D, 3D, Interactive Media and pure fine art with experimentation. If it is art or or design related, Pratt probably has a major in it. Moreover, unlike other stand alone art program, Pratt has some strong liberal arts because they have a creative writing major, which actually seems like a very strong, interesting major.\n\nMost of the professors at Pratt have their own businesses or had their own businesses and are considered top notch professionals in the field. Many, in fact, have writen some of the major books on the subject. Pratt also gets many notable visiting lecturers in their specialties.I should note that all professors must have office hours and most are very accessible to students. Moreover, you have professors teaching students and not generally TAs despite having a big graduate school.\n\nDespite all this, It is slightly easier to get into Pratt than that of some other top notch art programs.  Average SATs are about 1115 and average weighted GPA is 3.4.  Pratt student teacher ratio, according to them  is 11:1 with class sizes approximating 15-16 kids according to the tour guide.\n\nI asked many kids about Pratt,and they all love the academics of the school. I should note that they did warn me that Pratt does try to weed out kids during foundation year. expect to be worked very very hard!\n\nAnother great thing is that Pratt allows you to take courses from many diffrent areas. You are not locked into a major or into set course offerings. This allows a great deal of flexibility for students to design their own education.\n\nFinally, I and my wife viewed some of their finished work. My wife is a commercial designer of some former fame. She thought that the work produced was very professional and creative. She did like much of the work product of the students. However, we don't know if this product is typical of most students or was a result of what is the best of the best that was posted on studio walls and hallways.\n\nI should finally note that according to Pratt, 87% of the student body returns for their sophomore year. This is almost has high as some ivy schools and just a bit less than that of RISD. Certainly, it indicates that many students like their programs enough to come back.\n\nAs you can see, I have spent a lot of time on the academics, the reason is that this is the stand out feature of the school. As a stand alone art school, I would rate Pratt's academics as an A or A+.\n\n2.Parking: We were able to find parking both on the street and in parking lots ( for a small fee). I would n't say parking was easy,but, hey, you are in Brooklyn. Overall, we were able to get parking without paying for  it. I would, however, NOT suggest that you take a car to school. There is some vandalism, and you can get around taking the train. Overall, I would give the parking situation a C+ with a recommendation not to take a care to school unless you are a commuter.\n\n3. Food: I actually liked the cafeteria or should I say two cafeterias. One has some hot entrees such as turkey cutlets, port loin, roast beef etc and a salid bar and sandwich bar etc. The other cafeteria has pizza, desserts, Starbucks coffee etc. You pay for what you eat. This is not an \"eat all you want for one price deal,\" which can be pricey. My wife had a nice salid with some good grilled chicken and grilled salmon. Bordering the campus, students tell me there are lots of quality restaurants to go to that have tasty food and is reasonably priced. Overll, I would give the school food a B or B+.\n\n4.Dorms: Frankly, dorms are dorms. These weren't a standout. However, they do have several different types of dorms. You can get one type that has a bathroom for 4 students. However, the students must clean the bathroom. You can also get dorms with communial bathrooms with custodians cleaning them. All dorms have refridgerator and microwave and wireless is in most dorms. Starting fall, wireless will be omnipresent especially in all the dorms. Each dorm as a drafing board for each student, and housing is guaranteed for all years at Pratt as long as you turn in your housing form in a timely manner.\n\nI would give the dorms a C or C+\n\n5.Non-artistic facilites: Pratt has a nice indoor gym with 5 tennis courts, basketball courts, 200Meter running track, stat of the art weight room and nautalus type of equipment and lots of stationary bikes and tread mills. I would give this facility an A; however, there is one glaring weakness: there is no swimming pool. Pratt also has a nice student center with pool tables and similar stuff. Overall, I would give the non artistic facilites a \"B.\" If only they had a nice pool!\n\n6. Buildings and other artistic facilities. Pratt is a school of contrasts. They have these great academic offerings but have many buildings that are old and not maintained  well. RISD by contract has nice, old buildings with the emphasis on nice. With Pratt the emphasis is on old. Bathrooms had paint pealing. Tiles in a number of places needed repair. I even saw some studios where the professor posted notes warning the students to remove all art work due to the leaky ceilings! I will say in Pratt's defense, there is a lot of construction going on. Pratt is indeed trying to repair many of these problems. However, I do wonder what is taking them so long!\n\nI do tend to stick my nose where it doesn't belong ( I have to stop doing this).Bathrooms were somewhat clean but didn't have that nice deodorizing small found at Carnegie Melon. Also, all toilet paper was one play instead of the nice two play. This does indicate a bit of \"cheapness.\"\n\nIn addition, their marketing and management needs a lot of improvement. For example, when I first entered the campus asking the security guard \"where visitor parking was,\" he gave me a curt, surly answer. There was no warm fuzzies there. Moreover, when we entered the admission office, which was on the second floor, there was no sign of welcome, and no sign to the admission's office. Moreover, the admission's office secretary was very curt and also not really warm and furry. Try visiting RISD or Rochester Instutite of Technology. You will get a very different atmosphere.  I think the problem is due to bad leadership at  the top. However, if you check out the administration office where all the \"muckity mucks\" work, you will see very elaborate, well designed offices.\nFrankly, I think the president has been president for far to long at Pratt! They need some new blood and better marketing, and I would bet an improved administration.\n\n7. Diversity: You are not going to get any more Diverse place than Pratt. Not only are kids from many states,but we met folks from foreign countries as well. For example, we went into a graduate interior design studio with 4 students. One came from Florida, one from Isreal, one from England and one from Australia. They noted that there are a number of kids from foreign countries. Pratt does have a world wide reputation in a number of design fields.\n\n8. Miscellaneous: Pratt does have one other thing that makes them stand out from schools like RISD, MICA etc. Pratt actually has a nice campus. Yes, they have trees and bushes too. I saw kids playing frisbee and drawing under several trees. It's a decent sized campus too considering that the school isn't as large as many private schools. Moreover, there are all kinds of neat sculptures around the campus. This is a very nice touch.\n\nPratt's tuition at currently $25,000, while hefty, is a bit less than that of many private schools especially that of RISD, CMU, Syracuse and many stand along art school. Thus, even at $25,000 per year, they are sort of a bargain (gulp) They do, however, charge lots of different fees that will total around another $600 per year, not counting health insurance.\n\nI should note that Pratt does have some combined BFA and MFA programs, which can save a lot of money for those who will go on to graduate school anyway.  They currently have combined programs in art and in art education, Design and architecture and theory, critism and history of art, Library science and Juris Doctor, and other programs.\n\nFinally, Pratt adheres to the idiotic policy of a number of schools of not allowing AP credit unless you score a \"5.\" Be aware of this policy. Moreover, even transfer credits are limited.\n\nBottom Line: I loved the campus and the huge array of academic choices available. I also liked the end work product that we witnessed. I did not love the area that they are located in (although they do have a Manhattan campus for some programs)  and do have a gated campus with lots of security and didn't like their lack of maintenance on buildings. The administration seems to need improvement too with some marketing training for all employees. I guess it's a good thing that they are near a train station that will take kids to Manhattan.\n\nObviously, these are my musings from one visit. You may have a different impression from your own visits.

This is a summary of my visit.\n\n1. Academics: Pratt is one of the oldest stand alone art schools in the US dating back to 1888. It is certainly the biggest art school with almost 4,000 students ( about half are undergraduate). It is widely considered to be one of the best art and design programs in the country. Many of their programs are ranked in the top 10 such as Interior Design, Archtecture,Industrial Design and Communication Design to name just a few. Pratt has an amazing number of majors and offerings. For example, you can major in Communication Design that has three different concentrations ( writing, illustration, and graphic design). They are also one of the only Computer Graphic Programs around with 4 different emphasis such as 2D, 3D, Interactive Media and pure fine art with experimentation. If it is art or or design related, Pratt probably has a major in it. Moreover, unlike other stand alone art program, Pratt has some strong liberal arts because they have a creative writing major, which actually seems like a very strong, interesting major.\n\nMost of the professors at Pratt have their own businesses or had their own businesses and are considered top notch professionals in the field. Many, in fact, have writen some of the major books on the subject. Pratt also gets many notable visiting lecturers in their specialties.I should note that all professors must have office hours and most are very accessible to students. Moreover, you have professors teaching students and not generally TAs despite having a big graduate school.\n\nDespite all this, It is slightly easier to get into Pratt than that of some other top notch art programs. Average SATs are about 1115 and average weighted GPA is 3.4. Pratt student teacher ratio, according to them is 11:1 with class sizes approximating 15-16 kids according to the tour guide.\n\nI asked many kids about Pratt,and they all love the academics of the school. I should note that they did warn me that Pratt does try to weed out kids during foundation year. expect to be worked very very hard!\n\nAnother great thing is that Pratt allows you to take courses from many diffrent areas. You are not locked into a major or into set course offerings. This allows a great deal of flexibility for students to design their own education.\n\nFinally, I and my wife viewed some of their finished work. My wife is a commercial designer of some former fame. She thought that the work produced was very professional and creative. She did like much of the work product of the students. However, we don't know if this product is typical of most students or was a result of what is the best of the best that was posted on studio walls and hallways.\n\nAs you can see, I have spent a lot of time on the academics, the reason is that this is the stand out feature of the school. As a stand alone art school, I would rate Pratt's academics as an A or A+.\n\n2.Parking: We were able to find parking both on the street and in parking lots ( for a small fee).

However, we don't know if this product is typical of most students or was a result of what is the best of the best that was posted on studio walls and hallways.\n\nI should also note that according to Pratt's statistics, 87% of their students come back for their sophomore year. This is a high statistic and is higher than most stand alone art programs other than RISD. The students must appreciate the program that they are in.\n\nAs you can see, I have spent a lot of time on the academics, the reason is that this is the stand out feature of the school.

The male students tend to make comments about the young female teachers and comment about how they like them, but they don't actually connect with said teachers. The female students however, always tend to \"go after\" the male teachers they have eyes for.\n\nLast year, a friend of mine seemed really close with our spanish teacher. They're a perfect fit really. Both are the most sarcastic people in the world and are always too intense for early-morning chats. They bicker like an old married couple and are always challenging each other with mental \"battles\" that end in stare-offs, and sheepish grins on her part. I accused her of liking him and she brushed it off and said she thinks he's a jerk and would never like him. However she did dream once that the two of them were getting married, but said she has no idea why she had a dream like that. Just the other day, her pop got stuck in the vending machine and she went to him in the lunchroom to get it out. When he did, they had one of their numerous verbal exchanges that resulted in him shaking his head and grinning, and her giggling and doing her misty eyes. I called her out and asked if she'd had any dreams lately: she fell apart and said: \"I can't help it, I love him, aggh.....he's my boo!\"\n\nThat sort of revelation proves that love really is blind. She at least tried to block her liking of him out, but has to admit she does like the guy. I don't think it is something one can help really. You see a teacher five days out of the week, for practically 40 weeks out of the year. Depending on how outgoing you are, you may end up spending a lot of time talking and hearing what they have to say. They're people, not robots like most students take them to be. I think the students who realize this are the ones who easily fall victim to feelings for teachers. It is obvious they're inappropriate to showcase, especially if you are in their classes, but it's not something you can help much. It's really bad when there is a mutual attraction that develops. It shows, even if they try to hide it. Sometimes, all it takes is the grins and the bits of special treatment and the misty eyes, the complements, and especially, the accidental \"look.\" This look is brief and silent. It's when you just got done talking and yet you're still staring at each other with this dumb grin. I speak from experience.\n\nI for one actually fell for a teacher. Not a crush, oh no. Literally, the head-over-heels thing. People could tell too. I got comments because they could tell. He and I shared a lot in common; we shared movies and books and CDs; I actually got him \"friendly\" Christmas gifts like a Chewie tree ornament (Star Wars freak he is), and a Pooh Bear ornament too. He always told me not to because he said he couldn't give me anything. There were a few exchanges of flirting early on. However, he sadly got himself an ittle girlfriend and supposedly proposed over the summer. I still don't know if it is official. Having a girlfriend never stopped him from doing/saying things that showed he cares about me. Rotten luck I'm going to college next year while his life is already forming. Statistics back me up: 15% of engagements break off and 50% of marriages end in divorce before the five-year mark. In five years I'll have graduated from college. I'd like to return only to find him free and with open arms. Sorry--I sound crazy, I know, but honestly, we seriously got that close. Here's a littel proof- before he had the girlfriend, I had given him a free movie ticket (I work at a theater) but he didn't want to go to a movie alone. I was joking when I asked if he wanted me to see it with him, as though he needed a babysitter, but he took it for real. He sort of agreed to it, albeit for only five minutes, but still, he and I were making plans to see a movie (R-rated \"Girl Next Door\" too) but then he was like, \"oh great, it's rated R\" and he started questioning if it would be appropriate? Then his morals clicked in and he was suddenly like, \"I can't do that.\" Later on, I was giving him another free ticket and he, again, considered seeing Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban with me (I was going to a screening for employees only) until I said he can't see employee screenings. He settled on Troy, but came at the wrong time and ended up not seeing it: He lives for Post-It notes and didn't have one made for that night.\n\nEither way, I got really close with a teacher and I have a friend who is trying like crazy to not get attached to one.

It is straight numbers, or are there outside forces at work here?  Is the admissions office telling the truth when they say that perfectly valid applicants are deferred for no reason other than a lack of space?  Or are they capricious and evil?  I ran SAT I scores from both RD and EA admits as reported on the CC threads to compare.  Of course, admits v. rejections will result in a woeful underreporting error.  If the student only took the old SAT I, I averaged their two sections and added that to their total.\n\nThis is what I found.\n\nEA admits:\nn=24\nMedian SAT score: 2270\nStd. dev: 129.2\n\nRD admits:\nn=46\nMedian SAT score: 2280\nStd. dev: 132.9\n\nSurprising, then, the EA admissions pool actually has a lower median SAT score.  This is probably because the RD pool is more competitive, with thousands more applicants.  In any case, there is no statistical evidence whatsoever that either pool is fundamentally stronger than the other (p=.29).\n\nThe minimums for the two pools were actually exactly the same, save for two statistical outliers of 1780 in RD and 1890 in EA.  Both were URMs; make of that what you will.  As you can imagine, the distribution is heavily skewed rightward, with a full 25% of the RD pool scores coming in between 2360 and 2400.\n\nIn conclusion, MIT Admissions was wholy consistent in choosing their class based on SATs.  The admit pools are almost identical if only SAT I scores are considered.  Some outside factors must be at work (charming personalities, crazy EC successes, etc.)\n\nBut of course, therein lies the problem.  I'd like to compare EA admits vs. EA deferrals, then RD admits, but the latter group is quite underrepresented in the Official RD Decision thread (deferrals didn't write that they were deferrals).  That would give us a clue whether or not you have to be a much stronger applicant in order to survive a deferral.  Also interesting would be to add up SAT I+3 SATIIs for a composite testing score (4800 max).  We actually have the data for that, but I didn' think of it earlier and I can't be arsed to look through the threads again.  Someone else can pick that up.

I'm dropping in to give a quick update.\n\nAfter I did not make it into Princeton, I decided to look at transferring instead of applying as a Freshmen. I have 31 credits from Kennesaw State University, all GE so all transferable.\n\nTo my surprise, I found huge doors open for transferring. Many universities have big Freshmen washout rates. Because I kept a 4.0, I had proof that I could do the work, and so I didn't have to fuss hugely with verifying my homeschooling portfolio. I also kept up my EC's, gained ALOT of experience about the way college works, and learned much more about writing.\n\nThese combined got me into all the schools I applied to. I won't list them all, but I was VERY happy with the results. After narrowing down, BYU and Hillsdale were my top choices. Although I wasn't initially interested in BYU, after exploring their programs, I began changing my mind.\n\nAlthough I thought originally that it was just another school, it is actually highly competitive with excellent academic programs, and very hard to get into as a freshmen. The lowest GPA they accept is a 3.0, and the average acceptance GPA is a 3.85, few students get in with under a 26 ACT and most get in with 28-30. Of interest to me, they have some of the best language programs in the world, an excellent English program, and AMAZING dance classes. As a side note, I am in love with their library, it is HUGE! It has 98 miles of shelving for more than 6 million items! Its actually bigger than Princeton's library...\n\nI am also excited because some good friends of mine decided to there and will join me in a year. BYU also offered me scholarships and financial aid, so as long as I keep my grades up, I can completely afford it (which is good since I'm paying for it :p)\n\nIn the end, I'm still happy I applied for Princeton, because it was good experience. As devastating as the letter was, it gave me many opportunities to explore colleges across the country and compare where I wanted to go. I'm actually happy now that I didn't make it in, because I think I will like this college even better. So, for those who have just received or will receive those dreaded bits of paper, it can work, very well. Another thing I learned from my wise mother, wherever you end up, the difficulty of the programs won't matter if you don't sink in, you get out whatever you put in wherever you are.

I'm currently planning on applying SCEA, and will major in science or engineering, prbly engineering. However, I just read a review from ****.com that has really shocked me.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I went to Stanford as an Undergraduate in the late 1990's, majoring in one of the engineering departments...\n\nAnd it wasn't worth it. I view my diploma as a receipt, but nothing more. It's not as marketable as some propagandists would like you to believe. In fact, during this past summer's graduation ceremony, a number of students actually spelled out the word \"Unemployed!\" with pillows laid down on the football field, visible for all to see.\n\nLet me give you another example. For those of you who don't know, Donald Knuth is known in the academic community as the \"Father of Computer Science,\" and has been at Stanford since the late 1960's. He's well known for writing the \"Bible\" of computer science, \"The Art of Computer Programming\".\n\nYet even though I took over half-a-dozen core courses in Computer Science at Stanford, I never ONCE heard the name Donald Knuth, I never SAW the guy in person (or even in a photograph until I looked on his website many years after I graduated), and I have never read his books. \"The Art of Computer Programming\" books were never part of the curriculum.\n\nBut that's typical of Stanford: Pay a bunch of professors a lot of money to do very little teaching. In fact, professors generally have to teach only one-quarter (10 weeks total) of classes a year, and that's not even a full ten week period, because the lectures last all of 3 hours TOTAL in the week, and usually a couple of office hours placed at the most inconvenient times. This means that students are paying professors to devote 20% of a typical 40-hour work week to undergraduate matters, with the remaining 80% left to their own discretion. And for many professors, this schedule is in effect for only about 20% of the year (10 weeks out of 52 weeks in a year); the remaining 80% of the year is left to their discretion, such as doing research, consulting to other companies, doing lectures at other campuses, or running their own companies. (A rare handful of professors do teach for two quarters.) To add insult to injury, I had professors who skipped out on their office hours.\n\nA Stanford professor named Tom Campbell (Bachelors, Masters, and PhD degrees from the University of Chicago, PhD Harvard) actually served for five full terms in the House of Representatives of the United States Congress while simultaneously receiving his salary from Stanford. He spent so little time on the Stanford campus that some people started to get seriously upset. Critics charged that he was exploiting Stanford's flexibility, while advocates argued that he was increasing the visibility of Stanford and thus enhancing its reputation. After twenty years at Stanford, Campbell recently became the Dean of the Haas School of Business at UC Berkeley! Thanks Tom!\n\nMost professors don't grade papers, and leave it to the Teaching Assistants. This is like writing code without a computer in front of you, and never bothering to run the program on ANY computer. How do you know if your program works? How do the professors know if their teaching is any good? How many of Stanford's Nobel Prize winning faculty attended Stanford as an undergraduate? I don't think a single one.\n\nMost of the techie-Teaching Assistants didn't go to Stanford either. I had guys from Purdue, UCLA, Dartmouth, Amherst, U. of Maryland, U. of Texas, and of course, the ubiquitous University of California at Berkeley (UC Berkeley). Several profs got their undergrad degrees from Berkeley.\n\nThe professors always view themselves as RESEARCHERS first, and teachers a distant third or fourth -- if at all. If you look at the Stanford's \"Courses and Degrees\", which is a catalog that lists the courses being offered for a particular school year, you will see that many classes are taught by \"Staff\". No, \"Staff\" is not the name of a professor, but a euphemism for \"somebody who might be associated somehow to our department, such as a graduate student, and who may or may not have ever taught a class before, and who may or may not have any training in how to teach.\" Many of my classes were taught by Staff. I recently found out that the Staff instructor for an important core class, spanning two-quarters (20 weeks), had not even earned a Master's degree at the time he was teaching! He was a graduate student who only had a Bachelor's degree. He had practically zero teaching experience, and it showed. The poor quality of that class wasn't just my imagination, as that class has since been discontinued and is no longer offered, and that guy doesn't teach anymore anywhere in the world. But such vindication is small consolation. It was a waste of money and time that can never be recovered. Other core classes have even been taught by currently-matriculated UNDER-graduates. It amazes me that Stanford gets away with it, especially when most HIGH SCHOOLS require that their teachers have a master's degree and have passed state licensing exams.\n\nIn fact, some classes are so bad that Stanford undergraduates actually take courses at the nearby De Anza Community College and Foothill Community College. That's right: Community Colleges. Don't laugh -- if you read the book on the history of the Apple Macintosh, \"Insanely Great\", you'll find that the hardware engineer attended one of those community colleges (I don't remember which). And in my Freshman year, I knew a political science major who transferred from a California junior college into Stanford. As an out-of-stater, I was shocked, although I have learned that California's junior colleges have a higher standard than the rest of the nation. Nevertheless, it makes you wonder: Why am I paying so much money?\n\n\"Sophomore Slump\" occurs after the euphoria of Frosh year. You enter as a sophomore and realize \"the honeymoon is over\", i.e. that your professors aren't necessarily gifted in communicating their knowledge (one time literally a guy \"taught\" numerical analysis on computers by reading from a textbook!), and that the classes are bloated with too many students (I never had less than 50 in a class, so forget the 7:1 student teacher ratio published in US News and World Report's annual college survey).\n\nYears after I graduated, ex-president Gerhard Casper -- being a great guy who experienced similar problems during his undergraduate years in Germany -- tried to rectify the problem by creating Freshmen and Sophomore Seminars, to encourage faculty-student interaction and small class sizes. But the number of open slots for students is extremely limited, and most professors don't participate. Thus the vast majority of undergraduates miss out with one-on-one faculty contact, even though 100% of the student body pays the full $30,000/year tuition. And some of the seminars are of questionable quality. Nobel Prize winning physicist, Doug Osheroff (BS Caltech, PhD Cornell) taught a freshman seminar in...amateur photography. What a joke! Talk about taking advantage of the system.\n\nAnd don't get me started on the undergraduate \"advising system\", which is also a joke! Currently 78% of the faculty do NOT participate in advising undergrads. Many of the remaining advisers are upperclassmen trying to pad their resumes, or graduate students who are alumni of other universities and who are also trying to pad their resumes . You will not get good advice from these people, because they do not really have a track record to demonstrate the validity of their advice. It is the \"blind leading the blind.\" My own experience was a nightmare. Once I had declared my major, I chose a particular faculty member to be my adviser; he was the only guy in my field of interest. When I went to get my study list signed by him, he flatly refused, saying \"I don't advise undergraduates.\" I was furious, but what could I do? I ended up signing the remainder of my study lists on my own.\n\nHow do Stanford's engineering students fare when pitted against other students in competition? Not well. \"NATCAR\" is a contest for California electrical engineering students, in which radio controlled cars race around a track. Look at the results and search for the Stanford name: http://www.ece.ucdavis.edu/natcar/Race_Results.html.\nAs you can see, Stanford placed 10th in 2001, but is otherwise a no-show. In at least one of the years, the Stanford team tried-- but failed -- to get a car running. It looks like they have now simply abandoned the idea of entering.\n\nStanford's marketing department has used deceptive tactics to imply that Stanford has produced successful people. Look beneath the superficialities, and you'll find that the overwhelming majority did not attend Stanford as an undergraduate, and sometimes, not even as a graduate student. All of the following people have been used in Stanford marketing literature and press releases:                "}, {"date": "2006-08-28T11:50:11+00:00", "url": "http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/parents-forum/232219-weighted-unweighted-gpa-some-other-qs.html", "messages": "\n                    I am pretty new to this site (and to this experience).  I see many references to weighted GPAs, but am not entirely sure I understand how they are calculated or when (or if) they are actually used by colleges in the admission or merit aid process.  I assume that a \"weighted\" GPA somehow gives greater weight to advanced or AP courses.  If so, how?  My son is at a school with a 4.0 scale.  I have never seen any reference to \"weighting\" in the reports we get from his school.  He has taken just about all the advanced courses offered, with mixed results, so his GPA (\"un\"weighted, I guess) is solid but not exceptional, and is somewhat out of balance with his ACT/SAT scores, which are excellent.\n\nA related question I have is that I see references by some colleges to \"recalculating GPA for academic courses only.\"  So what does that mean?  Does phy ed drop out?  (That would make sense to me.)  How about music/band (that would make less sense to me).  What else?  I realize different colleges may have different standards, but any insight would be appreciated.\n\nWe are meeting with our son's school counselor this week so I'd like to know more before we have that meeting.\n\nSecond issue:  This counselor is actually assigned to both our rising senior son and our incoming high school freshman son, and we'll probably spend more time talking about the freshman.  He (like my older son) is anything but a \"type A\" student driven to get As in everything.  (I'm actually glad for that.)  He's a diligent student in most respects and likes getting good grades, but he's not going to chase them.  His approach is generally to do his schoolwork (not to mention his housework) as swiftly as possible, and not sweat the small details.  That way he has more time for friends, video games, etc.  We're working on that but it's his nature, and honestly it's not the worst approach to life anyway, so long as it's not taken to an extreme.  And he's a loving, funny kid, so it's not easy to be real hard on him.\n\nThe potential issue we see is that intellectually, he's very precocious.  With about an hour's preparation he took the ACT test in June and achieved scores across the board that most high school seniors would love.  (Fortunately, big brother bested him slightly in the math sections and therefore the overall score; there was a huge sigh of relief by our older son when the envelopes were opened.)  (As an aside, it was an eye-opener when I found this site to learn that there is an entire industry devoted to offering courses that kids take to prepare for these tests.  Yikes!  I can see why a number of colleges are making them optional.)\n\nAnyway, if anyone has any advice about how to keep a kid like that interested in high school I'd love to hear it, because I'm a little concerned it will become an issue.  I should probably mention he would roll his eyes all the way back into his head at the suggestion of taking college or on-line advanced courses and that we have no interest in accelerating him.  Bribery, on the other hand, occasionally works for short term motivation, and I am considering establishing some potential rewards (new computer components, e.g.) for certain GPA achievements.  The one thing we have learned in the process of our older son's college search is that a better GPA seems to open a lot more doors.  I realize there is probably a whole range of philosophical opinions about that approach, but at the risk of creating a firestorm I'd still appreciate any comments.\n\nThanks                "}, {"date": "2006-09-27T19:53:45+00:00", "url": "http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/parents-forum/243067-problems-with-ending-early-decision-phila-inquirer.html", "messages": "\nThe problems with ending early admissions \nSeptember 27, 2006\nSource: Philadelphia Inquirer\n\nChristopher Hooker-Haring\n\nis dean of admission and financial aid at Muhlenberg College in Allentown\n\nIn conversations about college admissions, it is popular to reduce complex issues to simple answers. Such is certainly the case with early-admissions programs. Harvard and Princeton have spoken, the popular media have spoken, and now all of higher education is supposed to follow.\n\nUnfortunately, what is lost in the rush for \"reform\" is this fact: Early-admissions programs are a student's one chance to communicate clearly and credibly his or her first-choice interest to a particular college. It's a direct communication duplicated nowhere else in the admissions process.\n\nThat might not matter to Harvard or Princeton. They may simply assume first-choice interest on the part of applicants - and they will be right most of the time. However, most of the rest of higher education enjoys neither Ivy League fame nor fortunes. In that other world, student interest is important, especially at a time when students are often applying regular decision to 12 or more colleges. For us, trying to judge yield on offers of admission has less to do with rankings and ratings than with institutional health and viability.\n\nBut what if all colleges dropped early programs? Who would benefit most? Harvard, Princeton and other institutions that could rely on the old prestige game as a primary driver of student decision-making. So in addition to the \"public good\" we are hearing so much about, institutional positioning is also at work here.\n\nHow would students fare in a \"no-early\" environment? If they couldn't signal a first choice, the system would become clogged with even more applications as students applied to multiple places, in many cases with minimal interest in actually attending those schools. As a result, many students truly interested in a certain college would be knocked out of the box. In other words, the admissions process would become less efficient, without making applicants less insecure. The biggest change would be moving all admissions decisions - and the accompanying anxiety attacks - to late spring.\n\nIn other words, the push to make things better for students could actually make things much worse. It would strip students of a voice regarding first choice, put off all admissions decisions until late in senior year, keep all students in the dark until late in the process, and clog the application pipeline with increasing numbers of low-interest applicants.\n\nEarly-admissions programs aren't perfect. No part of the admissions process is. But early programs can be responsive to student needs.\n\nAt Muhlenberg College, we've pushed early deadlines back to give students more time to think about the big first-choice decision, guaranteed that students will not be disadvantaged in financial aid if they go early, provided early financial-aid reads to families so they know before a deposit is required what kind of aid to expect, and actually counseled students to wait when an early decision seems inappropriate for them.\n\nPerhaps ending early-admissions programs is the right thing for the most elite institutions. For the majority of schools, however, early admissions is an opportunity to balance multiple, often competing, priorities in a thoughtful, responsible way.\n\nContact Christopher Hooker-Haring at hookerh@muhlenberg.edu\n\nhttp://www.nacacnet.org/MemberPortal/News/newsfeed/newsarticle.htm?id=I2451682790 "}, {"date": "2007-02-08T15:34:02+00:00", "url": "http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/parent-cafe/298149-jury-duty-a-waste-of-my-time.html", "messages": "\n                    Well, I just spent all day yesterday hanging around a jury lounge since I was required, under penalty of law, to attend. I had to show up by 8am, the first jury pool (50 people for one case) was called around 10:30am followed by a second one (45 people). I wasn't called to those but was called to one (among 45 people) at 11:45 so they told us to report to a particular coutroom after lunch at 1:30 (the only people I know who have an hour and a half lunch period). So I kill time for almost 2 hours and then go hang out in the hallway with the other 44 people for about 45 minutes when they told us to return to the jury room while they decide if there'll be a plea bargain or not. So I return to the jury room and hang around there while the plea's being discussed until 3pm when they finally told us a plea bargain was reached and we could go home.\n\nThe end result is that I had to waste a day and not even actually serve on a jury all because some idiot criminal decided to break the law or because somebody decided they were going to file a civil lawsuit against someone (one of these in the past was some lady who slipped on a spilled drink at a mall so was suing the mall - if she'd have watched where she was walking I and 44 others wouldn't have had to waste our day). That criminal or that civil litigator caused about 200 people to have to waste their entire day.\n\nI think we need a more efficient system. I say we should do the following -\n\n- Have many of the lower level cases, especially civil ones, judged by a pool of judges or professional jurists.\n\n- Eliminate the jurist ejection by lawyers option. This would reduce the 'panel pool' form say 50 to more like 15 to 20 and would reduce the tweaking and bias of the actual jury which often ends up to be not so random at all.\n\n- Require that if there's a jury court date officially set, that's it - it's going forward and it's too late for last second pleas/settlements (while the panel's standing in the hallway). let them do their plea bargaining and settlement bargaining before without impacting potential jurists.\n\n- If the above were done the number of people called to jury duty would be decreased substantially, it would boost productivity of the nation and reduce the burden on employers since those people could now be at work, would reduce the cost to the government (and my taxes) by not having to pay the jurists their paltry entitlement, and would allow those called to feel as if they actually served a useful purpose other than as a seat warmer.

So I spent a lot of time on a League Board, including a stint as president and chief flak-catcher.  And over the years I saw more BS parading as \"principle\" than I could ever forget.  And I observed some patterns and learned some truths about human behavior.\n\n1)  Good People will do bad things if they can justify it as serving a noble goal.\n2)  Good People will act in self-serving ways as to which they don't want to admit their actual motives - sometimes even to themselves.\n3)  When a Good Person is motivated to do something bad and/or self serving,  they are highly motivated to recast the reason they are doing it as being based on some laudable abstract principle or noble cause, instead of their actual selfish motivation.\n3)  Anything that's \"for the children\" is a noble cause.\n5)  When Good People do self-serving or bad things under the cloak of a noble purpose, they are impelled to exaggerate and distort reality to reinforce the cloak of an abstract principle at issue and direct attention away from their true motives - again, not necessarily consciously.\n\nHow does this pan out in real life?  Well, let's say Johnny's dad wants to coach the \"prestige\" team that year.  His competition is a long time league coach - Bob - whose own children have grown up.  Gossip will start to circulate about the importance of the \"bond\" between fathers and sons in sports.  Dark mutterings will crop up about sexual deviates - why does Bob want to hang around little kids, anyway?  Has the league really done a good background check?  Hey, legitimate questions, right?  All asked for the benefit of \"the children\", right?  But its not really about That.  It's about John Sr. beating out Bob.\n\nDoes Mary want her older son to play on the \"cool\" team but is worried that better but younger players will get chosen instead?  Prepare for a debate about the importance of peer group bonding, appropriate social development, etc. which mandates forming teams by age, not skill.  (Or the opposite argument from the dad of a skilled younger player.)   Again, legitimate subjects, but not really the point.   Prepare to be accused of not caring about \"the children\" if you disagree - even though it's really not about them at all.   I heard the damndest theories spun about lofty ideals - which always seemed to end up with the source (or the source's best friend) obtaining some inconceivably trivial advantage.  I've seen grown men hatch bizarre plots over what spot their kid was in the batting order.  I've heard vicious rumors circulated about kids who competed with little Johhnie for preference at a given position.  When a few innings of a game between 10 year olds had to be played over because one of the coaches messed up his batting order (with, predictably, the result that his best hitter - a girl - batted four times for the other players' two) the do-over somehow offended the United States Constitution - and lawsuits were threatened - on principle, of course.  I'm not kidding.  In an older age group a high school coach at a nearby school was fired after a huge uproar sparked by a group which circulated anonymous letters accusing him of all kinds of things - including things I personally knew to be untrue (because I was the person they would have been reported to if they'd happened.)  The real problem?  The son of one couple who was a legitimate third string player was told that he was - third string at his position.  But that was never mentioned, even once.  It's not just Little League - it happens in every arena of modern life, from schools to neighborhood issues to the workplace.  But Little League is where I learned the lesson.\n\nAnd the lesson I learned is that Good People can do bad and/or self serving things, and will, if they can cloak their concerns in the guise of an issue which is based on a noble principle divorced from their personal interests.  And I'm not being sarcastic or ironic when I refer to the \"Good People.\"  Many of these folks were friends of mine; almost all of them were legitimately honest, upright citizens - bona fide \"Good People.\"   But somehow when they're able to convince themselves that it's not about their personal interests (which just happen to coincide with the proper application of the Noble Cause) they justify to themselves conduct that I honestly think they would never indulge in if they fairly and honestly assessed their own motivations.\n\nSo when I see people distorting and exaggerating events to make them appear to fit the mold of a noble cause, I'm inclined to look to see how they are likely to benefit (or how is someone they dislike likely to suffer) from the battle over that principle.  Because likely as not, while there will be some factual basis which, if distorted and exaggerated enough, will provide a fig leaf of justification for the struggle, it's really Not About That.  And when that's the case arguing about That is often a mistake, because when backed into a corner, the Good People will redouble their cloaking efforts.  So if you disagree, you are now \"against the children\" or \"for premarital sex\" or whatever.  And you can never effectively counter that accusation, since \"it\" really isn't actually \"about\" the cloaking noble cause you're now accused of being against.\n\nThat's what I learned from Little League.

The Foundation of Anti-Oppressionist Morality\n\nIn an absolute sense, we humans mean nothing.  What's so important about the human race in general?  What importance do we have to the universe?  Assuming that there is no God (for as a friend of mine once said, \"The burden of proof lies on the one claiming the positive\"), our importance does not exist, and we are all equally irrelevant.\n\nHowever, it is pretty clear that, pending morality, we are all important to ourselves.  It therefore follows that because I am important to myself, every conscious being must be (relatively) important.  It is possible for humanity to be important and non-important at the same time, much like it is possible for a marble to be big and small at the same time.  The marble is big relative to the atom, while it is small relative to the solar system.  Similarly, the human is important to himself, and therefore, to other humans, while it is unimportant in an absolute sense.\n\nBecause every conscious being must be objectively equal, it therefore follows that the sum of many conscious beings is more important that one conscious being alone; in other words, that the majority is more important than the minority, and that \"the greatest benefit for the greatest number of people shall determine the moral course of action,\" which is, in effect, the theory of utilitarianism.\n\nII.     The Hierarchy of Morality\n\nYet it is quite clear that giving the majority what they want will eventually cause things to become ugly and immoral.  Utilitarianism dictates that slavery would have been moral in the 19th century, and that it is morally acceptable to ostracize one person in order to strengthen ties between the others.  It is therefore obvious that utilitarianism is subordinate to other moral ideals.  It must be below compassion and freedom as well as justice.  (It obviously isn't fair---or morally acceptable---to vote the winner of a nine-person race out of first place just to improve the standing of the other eight.)  However, utilitarianism is occasionally the principle to be followed.  If ten people want to play hide-and-seek, three people want to play house, and all of them want to play together, the kids ought to play hide-and-seek because there's no reason not to benefit the majority (assuming all are in good physical condition).\n\nBecause we have now established that at least three moral ideals are superior to utilitarianism, we now know that utilitarianism is not the ultimate (highest-ranking) moral ideal.  But if not utilitarianism, what is the ultimate moral ideal?\n\nLet us first begin with freedom.  It is clear that if we put freedom above all else, society shall crumble (unless it's an anarchic society, but anarchism requires the assumption that the majority is anarchist).  If we put freedom first, or even above compassion, corporations will be able to exploit people to the best of their ability, poor people will be left to starve to death, and people will be allowed to rape and murder people whenever they want to.  Society, in other words, will be governed by force.\n\nWhat if we put compassion above all else?  Then everyone would be forced to live for everyone else, religion would be banned (it creates too many religious conflicts, thus disrupting the peace), and political activists would be prosecuted.  So as you can see, all-out compassion destroys freedom, and all-out freedom destroys compassion.  Because there cannot be more of one than the other, the two must be equal in value, or at least close to equal.\n\nWhat if we put justice above compassion and, therefore, above freedom as well?  This, of course, depends on what justice is.  In this essay, we shall take justice to mean the \"an-eye-for-an-eye\" principle, the \"you-get-exactly-what-you-deserve\" law.  (Some people use the term \"justice\" to refer to the sum of all moral ideals, for example \"It's just not right.\")  Needless to say, this makes justice an abominable ideal.  Under the law of justice, if one takes a life, he must have his life taken.  Under the law of justice, everyone is treated equally regardless of the situation.  Under the law of justice, we humans would all have to commit suicide because of all the bacteria we have destroyed by washing our hands.  It is therefore fairly clear that we cannot have a society in which justice is more important than all other moral ideals, or even one in which justice is more important than compassion.  So this makes justice at most third place.\n\nSo currently we have established that compassion and freedom are equal and tie for first, that justice comes third, and that utilitarianism comes fourth.  What about reason?  Let us imagine a society in which reason is of no importance....\n\nA fleet of robots, each specializing in a very specific area, control the earth.  When they feel the urge to do so, the humans urinate and defecate in a little tube.  This tube leads to machines that make oil from organic compounds.  The oil powers the robots, who not only replicate themselves but also serve the humans.  All knowledge has been destroyed, for with knowledge, humans would know how to turn off the robots and thus subvert society.  Nobody has a job; the robots do everything for the humans.  Innovation is not necessary, for humans are content as is.  What's wrong with this picture?  Absolutely nothing---if one ignores the moral law of reason.  We must declare as axiomatic the relevance of the truth, or else we end up with a society that frightens most sane members of the population.\n\nReason is also necessary because without reason, one cannot pinpoint the path of maximum morality.  For this reason, reason is the most important moral law of all.  It trumps both compassion and freedom, or at least ties with both.\n\nIII.     Reason and Absolute Power\n\nAuthority is the arch-nemesis of reason.  I say this not only because authority alone can diminish a person's reasoning capacities, but also because when a person has authority, he doesn't have to reason, and tends not to do so.\n\nAn example of authority diminishing a person's reasoning capacities can be found in the book 1984 by George Orwell, in which Winston, an undercover anti-Party crusader, is captured and is slowly brainwashed through the systematic use of force.  An example of this occurring in real life can be found in the Milgram experiment on authority, in which the subject is told to ask another \"subject\" a series of questions and to administer electric shocks of increasing strength if he did not provide the correct answer.  Now what this subject didn't know was that the person he was supposed to shock was actually a researcher, and that this researcher was not connected to the shocking apparatus.\n\nThe shocking apparatus supposedly could not give more than a 450-volt shock, and both the subject and the researcher were given a 45-volt shock before the commencement of the experiment; the subject because it was required for the moral conflict (between following orders and following conscience) that he know what he was supposedly doing to the researcher, and the researcher because he was trying to act like a fellow subject who had been given his role at random.\n\nWhen the subject reached 150 volts, the researcher sitting in the chair asked him to stop the experiment, as it was allegedly becoming increasingly painful and dangerous.  However, another researcher told the subject to continue with the experiment; if the subject was hesitant to do so, the researcher would tell him that he was responsible for anything that happened to the other \"subject.\"\n\nDespite the fact that the subjects knew (or thought they knew) the pain they were inflicting upon the researchers and that reason, coupled with the rest of morality, would have likely impelled them to stop had they not been exposed to authority, 65% of them went all the way; i.e., \"administered the experiment's final 450-volt shock.\"  This was in stark contrast to what was expected; most people that Milgram had asked beforehand had predicted that very few people would actually do so.  And it shows quite well how much impact authority can have upon a person's judgment and actions.\n\nThe second reason I have given for my statement above is that when a person has authority, he need not reason, and tends not to do so.  This is quite evident in many families; next time you see a parent with a teenager or child, wait for him to say \"Because I said so\" and threaten the kid with spanking, grounding, or revocation of a privilege in order to force the child to abide by a personal prejudice of the parent's.\n\nIt is also evidenced by what is now known as the Stanford prison experiment; in this experiment, which was designed for the purpose of observation of prison behavior, the subjects were divided into two groups of people, one labeled \"guards\" and the other labeled \"prisoners.\"  They were then brought to the basement of the Stanford psychology department, which had been designed to look like a prison, and the guards were told to keep control of the prison in question without resorting to the use of physical force.\n\nAfter a while, the guards started mistreating and abusing the prisoners; that is, they started acting as if they were somehow superior to them, even though the roles of the subjects had been chosen randomly.  This continued to the point where five prisoners had to be released from the experiment before its termination, despite the fact that the experiment itself was terminated eight days before it was supposed to end.  As the people chosen to participate in the experiment were the most normal people applying to participate, and as most did not behave in such a monstrous way in real life, it is relatively safe to say that during the experiment, authority had clouded the guards' judgment and had removed them from a sense of moral responsibility.\n\nSo, in short, authority is the arch-nemesis of reason; this proposition can be restated as \"absolute power corrupts absolutely.\"\n\nIV.    The Ultimate Utopia\n\nSince authority is the arch-nemesis of reason, it therefore follows that the only way to achieve a rational society is through the elimination of all authority.  This proposition has some very far-reaching consequences; in order to eliminate authority, we must eliminate government, capitalism, the structure of family, and religion.  It's easy to see how the proposition necessitates the elimination of government; as government gives government officials authority over average citizens, or, in some cases, puts the majority above the minority.  The religion proposition is also fairly straightforward: religion puts the alleged will of a \"God\" not proven to exist (note that faith is not subject to reason and is therefore immoral in a way) over all of humanity.\n\nSome would deny the fact that capitalism puts bosses above workers; these people state that the two are in a mutually beneficial joint partnership.  This is true to an extent; however, the boss is still often above the worker, as the boss can force the worker to do anything so long as his practices are less merciless than those of all other employers.  And often other employers run scarce; this would explain why Third-World workers line up by the thousands to apply for sweatshop position in which they are constantly abused, overworked, and underpaid.  One could even say that these laborers are doing backbreaking work under the threat of starvation, for they know very well that the bosses have the power to fire them at will and to reduce them to a state of hunger and homelessness, and the bosses know that the workers know this.  This is little more than slavery, and obviously represents a relationship tarnished by authority.\n\n(One could also say that capitalism puts the rich in general above the poor in general, as money grants one the power to have other people work for you, and the rich have more money, and therefore more power, than the poor.)\n\nPerhaps the worst hierarchical relationship currently visible is the relationship between family members.  The father is above the mother (fortunately, this is changing, albeit slowly), who is above the children.  I say this is the worst form of authority because it influences children at a very young age.  It impresses upon them that might makes right, that life isn't fair, that it's useless to challenge authority because the parents can make you suffer for doing so.  The adults have a means of enforcing their will.  They're the ones with the whips, so you'd better stay on their good side, even if they're wrong.  In effect, the structure of family trains children to tolerate totalitarianism, and in doing so, forces them to accept the patterns of exploitation and dominance exhibited in other hierarchical relationships.\n\nWhat would a society without these patterns of dominance, that is, a rational society, be like?  First of all, government would be replaced by a system in which people resolve issues through discussion and debate, thus allowing the most reasonable solutions to flourish while the oppressive ones die out.  (Contrary to the belief of many, voting in most cases would be a bad idea, as it would only serve to put absolute power in the hands of the majority.  But of course in situations in which no side is clearly in the moral right or the moral wrong, on in time-sensitive emergencies, it is acceptable to vote, as there's no reason not to appeal to the desires of the majority.)  Of course, everyone would be allowed in these debates, as nearly everyone has the potential to have good ideas.  (If the meetings become too big, groups of people send delegates to groups of people who send delegates to groups of people who send delegates to the meetings.)  Although some people say that the lack of government would cause crime, this would not be the case, as in a rational society, the rational majority would likely form a huge group dedicated to the prevention and termination of crime, owing to the fact that most people desire law and order.\n\nOf course, this begs the question \"How do we know it's going to do that?\"  This is where the revolt comes in.  Unfortunately, this society can only be achieved through majority revolt in the name of such a society.  (It's sad, but it's a clear case of the ends justifying the means.)  Although this is mainly because revolt is the only way of abolishing a government without creating a new one in its place, the revolt also comes in handy due to the convenient fact that anyone who willingly revolts in the name of a society will probably be dedicated to the creation of that society in question.  It also provides a sort of safeguard; if I'm delusional and this idea is far too idiotic to be even worth thinking about, the revolt won't happen, as I probably won't be able to persuade the masses to revolt in the name of a rational society.  Of course, someone eloquent and persuasive could attempt to do so, but with rhetoric rather than reason; this, however, would lead to a revolt by the brainwashed rather than a revolt by the consenting majority and would therefore not be the type of revolt necessary for the achievement of a rational society.\n\nOf course, some people claim that any revolt will be squashed by the government before it succeeds in achieving its objective.  This is not altogether true, despite the fact that some governments are extremely difficult to assail.  Why?  Because no leader wants to kill everyone he rules over.  It's hard work rising to power, you know.  (This is another reason why we need a majority revolt and not a revolt by two or three radicals.)\n\nBut in any case, the huge crime-fighting group which I mentioned before would not treat criminals in an immoral and uncompassionate fashion, as its constituents would all be morally righteous, and all practices of the crime-fighting group would be open for debate, just as all other issues would.\n\nThis crime-fighting group, by the way, would also have as one of its duties the prevention of totalitarianism; that is, it or some other newly-formed group would prevent any hopeful despot from rising to power.  This would be easily accomplished, as the majority would be highly sensitive to tyranny, and would also be relatively skilled in revolting, having revolted before.  (This is another reason why the minority cannot liberate the people for them; if some despot decides to take over the world, the majority will be left completely defenseless.)  It would also be easily accomplished because in this society the majority would give everyone one standard gun in order to eliminate inherent differences in strength and therefore put power in the hands of the majority (Alex can shoot Betsy as hard as Betsy can shoot Adam, but without guns, Alex would undoubtedly be able to intimidate Betsy as well as Chris) and for the purpose of protection against tyranny.  Of course people would be able to make better guns, but those people would be disarmed by the majority.\n\nWhile guns would ultimately put absolute power in the hands of the majority, ultimately power must lie somewhere, and the rational majority is the safest place to put it.  (Unfortunately, no society is perfectly rational, much like how no chemical reaction can give you 100% yield, and although this society is more rational than many, it falls short of perfect rationality.  Despite the fact that absolute power, even when placed in the hands of the majority, corrupts absolutely, the majority is far less corruptible than the minority is.  Besides, if the majority starts becoming incredibly tyrannical, the minority could always attempt to influence its policy using terrorist tactics.\n\nThe economy would be organized in one of two possible ways: it would either be organized in a manner similar to the government, with people resolving economic issues through discussion and debate, or it would operate on a \"from each according to ability, to each according to need\" basis (sorry for the cliche).  The former option would lead to a rational society, while the latter would lead to a compassionate and free one.  (Recall that reason may tie with compassion and freedom.)  Of course, the people might find a better option (through debate, of course), in which case they would (hopefully) adopt it.  But in any case, it would be unacceptable for the economy to be controlled by any small group of people, as that would create a measure of authority in that grouop of people.\n\nWhat would the family structure be replaced by in a rational society?  My guess is that anyone who wanted to take care of children would be able to do so, but that nobody would force any child to do anything.  Of course, they would warn them that their actions would have real-life consequences; for example, that playing in the street may result in their getting hit by a car.\n\nReligion hopefully wouldn't be replaced with anything, as religious belief is based on faith rather than on reason and therefore doesn't belong in a rational society.  Of course it'd be oppressive to harm someone for his religious beliefs, but religion hopefully wouldn't matter during the rational decision-making process.  In other words, there'd hopefully be separation of church and state.\n\nPerhaps the most pressing question of all is whether this society shall ever actually be realized.  In the end, what will determine whether this revolt which sets all this stuff in motion happens or not will be whether humans can conquer their own instincts through awareness of their faults.  If they can conquer their tendency to be capitalistic, to always look out for themselves, to stay on top of the hierarchy rather than abolishing it altogether, then this revolt may eventually happen.  Otherwise, humanity will forever continue to live in illogical misery and despair.\n\nI am indebted to the following sources, yet have not relied exclusively on them in forming my opinions (in short, Bibliography):\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milgram_experiment\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_Prison_Experiment\nhttp://www.stanford.edu/dept/news/relaged/970108prisonexp.html\nhttp://www.zabalaza.net/pdfs/sapams/ffa.pdf\nSteiner, Claude M.

You can get a vague idea of dorm personalities that way.  Also, go online and read up on the FSILGs.\n\n2) CPW (optional but recommended): CPW is a great time to explore housing options!  Take advantage of this time to visit lots of living groups in person.  This is a stage where you want to be open-minded - you might have gotten vague impressions from the i3 videos or whatever, but in-person visits are much more significant.  Talk to actual residents, both to find out their thoughts about their living group and to get a sense of what they are like and whether they are people you'd enjoy living with.\n\n3) Rank temp housing preferences: Based on the info that you've gathered thus far, rank the dorms.  MIT will use your choices to determine where you live during Orientation.  Choose carefully, because depending on how heavily subscribed various dorms are, being able to switch out is not guaranteed.\n\nWARNING: McCormick and some of the Cultural Houses have binding RBA, which means that if you get assigned to them in the summer, you will NOT be able to switch out.  Next House has RBA, but it is (they finally changed it!) not binding, and you can still move.\n\n4) REX (Dorm Rush to students): This is the period of Orientation where you actually choose your dorm.  If you want to get the most out of your housing experience, it is very important that you take this seriously and try to find the best place for you!  Don't be lazy and complacent!  If you love your temp dorm, great, but you still need to make sure that there's not an even better place.  I don't care what the latest admin propaganda says, just about any student (students being the people who, unlike most admins, actually know what it's like to live in the housing system) will tell you this.  Students have fought for years to ensure that this time will still exist for you as it did for them...don't blow it off.\n\n5) In-House Rush (for most frosh): Many of the dorms have subcultures based around halls (e.g. EC, B-C, Next), floors (e.g. Random, Senior Haus), entries (e.g. MacGregor) or other subsections (New).  This is where you get to choose one.  You'll still be living in your temp dorm, but by this time you'll have your permanent dorm assignment.  All the dorms with In-House Rush (sometimes called Hall Rush, Floor Rush, etc) have it at the same time, and you go to your permanent one for whatever they have.  Each dorm that has In-House Rush will have its own procedure.  Some number of people from that dorm will spend all night assigning frosh to rooms, and the results are generally posted in a prespecified location in that dorm early the next morning.\n\n6) Move-In: Don't worry if you are moving from, say, Next House to Senior Haus (which is nearly a mile walk).  Or if you're moving from the first floor of your temp dorm to the fifth (I did this).  A sizable corps of current students will be mobilized, starting early in the morning and going most of the day, to help you move your stuff.  Traditionally, fraternity brothers (who like getting the face time with the frosh) run between-dorm moving.  They will help you carry your stuff to a shuttle van, load it, drive it to your new home, and unload it for you.  Current residents of your new dorm will help you carry your stuff from the unloading point to your new room.  Many living groups will have welcome-the-frosh dinners/events/meetings.\n\n7) FSILG Rush (optional, but recommended): A few days after you move in (generally starting the final weekend of Orientation), Rush starts for fraternities, sororities, and ILGs.  Each of these FSILG systems has its own rush system.  Fraternity Rush is generally a few days long, and rushees can go from house to house (there are a lot of fraternity houses) at will.  They have a lot of rules about house behavior to make sure they don't step on each other's toes.  Sorority Rush is also a few days long, but highly centralized...you have to sign up for it, and neutral guides will take you in groups from house to house, advise you on your choice, and conduct structured events.  ILG Rush tends to be highly informal and highly decentralized.  Each house does their own thing without much regard for what the other houses are doing.  It tends to be lower-pressure and keeps going in the same low-key, informal way, off and on, for months (ET might be an exception to this - their procedures are sort of ILG/fraternity hybrid from what I understand, and they have a pledge program).\n\nKeep in mind that participating in FSILG Rush is not binding.  You can (and probably should) explore this other set of options, without feeling like it will force you to abandon your dorm living group.  Even if you are sure you want to stay in a dorm, it will give you a better understanding of cultures around campus.\n\nA couple of tips:\n\n- Don't bring your parents!  Housing selection activities are geared toward students by themselves!  There are numerous CPW and Orientation activities for parents, including dorm tours, and numerous opportunities during CPW and Orientation for parents and students to hang out together that are not during housing selection.\n\n- Relatedly, if you need something from the dorm deskworkers, talk to them yourself!  Don't have (or let) your parents be the one to do it.  I can think of few better ways to create a bad impression with your new dormmates, and it happens to a bunch of people every year.\n\n- Don't bring a bunch of stuff!  I brought two suitcases initially - one of stuff that I would need right off the bat, and one full of camping stuff for my pre-Orientation program, which was a camping trip/geology expedition in Colorado for a week before Orientation.  Everything else, my parents shipped to me after I had moved into my permanent room.  This made moving much easier.  I advise you to do something similar.\n\n- Even if you stay in the same living group, most dorms will not allow you to stay in the same room.  This is because they don't want people to refrain from participating in REX or In-House Rush so that they don't have to move.  They want you to realize that you will have to move anyway!\n\n- Be wary of stereotypes.  Like any other stereotype, they range from completely true to completely false, with most falling in the \"overgeneralization based on a grain of truth\" category.  Things that I have heard from outsiders about my own hall over the years, often from people who didn't know where I lived, include: We're all insane, we're all scary druggies, we're all hackers, we're all goths, we only go outside at night, we're satanists who conduct satanistic rituals, we never wear shoes, we have wild orgies all the time...you get the idea.  Go check the place out for yourselves instead of relying on stereotypes!\n\n- The best way to learn about a living group is to talk to the residents.

If I would stay in Estonia I would go to the leading university in here.\n\nGPA - about 4,6/5 or 93% but it's not actually calcualted. This is based on my course grades and I have about 110 courses in high school.\n\nRank - also, school does not rank, but I should be 3/29 (I know, small class. But again, very very competitive)\n\nCourses - we don't get to choose our subjects but follow the national curricula. so, we have about 20 different subjects throughout high school (meaning that every year I have the same 20 subjects) This gives a very strong base but has a negative effect on my GPA. This year we actually had some electives and I had the most difficult course load possible.\n\nSAT - not taken yet, but shouldn't actually be very difficult. I'm sure I'll get atleast 2000 on the reasoning test and 700 on subject tests (Physics, US History, MathII)\n\nBackround - white, but grandmother from a small minority group and grandfather from Ukraine\n\nAwards:\nIII place in History olympiad 2006\nIII place in G5 debating contest (G5 - the 5 best schools in Estonia) 2007\nA diploma from the President's Historical Research contest 2006\nA diploma form the National Archive for Historical Research 2007\n\nExtracurricular Activities:\n1996-2006 gymnastics/showdance\n2008 ballroom dancing\n2001-2004 art school\n2006-2009 debating (one of the organisers of Tallinn Open - an international debating contest)\n2008-2009 judge in various debating competitions\nphotography + photo editing\n2008-2009 the school choir\n2008 \u0084Security Policy and National Defence\u0093 \u0096 course in university, earning college credit, will continue in autumn (with a different course)\n\nWork experience:\n2007 - translated scientifical research from English into Estonian\n2008 summer - worked as a shop assistant in a phone shop\n\nVolunteering:\n\n2008 \u0096 Clean Estonia\n2007 \u0096 planting trees\n2006 \u0096 cleaning forests from garbage\n(all this is very popular in Estonia and is almost the only volunteer work possible)\n\n\nAs for my college preferences... I'm not sure. I seem to like almost every environment - small town, big city, you name it. I've lived in both and understand that both have their pros and cons. I would like to go to a smaller school (15000 undergrads is too much). I'm mostly looking for east coast schools (easier to travel from Europe + I like the weather).\n\nWith many schools I just feel they are right for me. Yale, Oberlin, Colby and MIT seem to be my favourites right now. With the others I'm not so sure, maybe I just don't know enough about them.\n\nI greatly appreciate your help :) "}, {"date": "2008-10-15T02:44:51+00:00", "url": "http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/what-my-chances/580932-help-chances-suggested-ca-schools-for-scholarships.html", "messages": "\n                    Hi everyone,\n\nPlease forgive my ignorance here, I am trying to help my daughter do some legwork before we start her actual applications next week, her dad and I never went to college.

I want to attend graduate school for the same subject. Here are my stats:\n\nGPA: 3.65\nGRE: 690 Verbal; 800 Math (don't have writing score yet)\n2 year of research in an old group.\n1 summer and this fall semester in a new research group.\n\nFirst question is should I retake the GRE? The verbal score is low, although I know it is considered high for engineers. I am just concerned because my GPA isn't high enough to compensate for it. Should I retake the test?\n\nRegarding my GPA, I didn't do well my first two years. I did not perform well in my second semester of organic chemistry (I didn't do well in the first semester either) and second semester of inorganic chemistry. I had a B and B- in those classes, respectively. I also took some superfluous classes (English), because those were requirements for a chemistry degree (I later transferred to chemical engineering). I didn't do well (B+ for both English classes) in that it lowered my GPA.\n\nSo I don't know if my GPA is competitive enough. Some of the schools I wish to apply to (UC Santa Barbara) have average admitted student GPA's of 3.8: ( UCSB - Chemical Engineering - Graduate Program )\n\nBut I did work really hard my third year:\n\nFall 2007\nCHM ENG 141 (Thermodynamics): A-\nCHM ENG 150B (TRANS & SEPARA PROC): A\nCHM ENG 170 (BIOCHEM ENGIN): A\nCHEM 201 (\tFUND INORGANIC CHEM): A   (This and 250A were only 1-unit grad classes)\nCHEM 250A (INTRO BOND THEORY): A-\nENGIN 198 (DIRECTED GROUP STDY): P\nMAT SCI 102 (BOND CRYS & CRY DEF): A\nMAT SCI 120 (MATLS PROD): A\nPHYSICS H7C (SCIENT ENGIN PHYS): B+\nUGIS 192D (RESEARCH PHYSIC SCI) P\n\nSpring 2008:\n\nCHM ENG 142 (CHEM KIN REACT ENG): A-\nCHM ENG 157 (TRANSPORT LAB): A-\nCHM ENG 170B (BIOCHEMICAL ENGIN): A\nCHM ENG 176 (ELECTROCHEM PROCESS): A+\nCHM ENG 179 (SOLID STATE DEVICES): A\nCHEM 135 (CHEMICAL BIOLOGY): A-\nCHEM 250B (INORG SPECTROSCOPY): A (this and 253AB were only 1 unit)\nCHEM 253A (MATERIALS CHEM I): A\nCHEM 253B (MATERIALS CHEM II): A-\nMEC ENG 151 (ADV HEAT TRANS): A\nUGIS 192D (RESEARCH PHYSIC SCI): P\n\nI boosted my GPA from a ~3.53 to a 3.65. I also took some graduate courses in inorganic chemistry to compensate for that B- in my undergraduate course. The chemical biology course was to atone for my organic chemistry grades (but that class didn't have too much Ochem). But is this too little, too late? I took so many classes, but my GPA is still not nearly as good as the average admitted student of a top school. I don't know how a school is willing to look over the fact I wasn't studious enough my first two years (I lived in the noisy dorms and couldn't study, and was depressed over a girl). And I've generally been only able to get A-'s, at best, in my core chemical engineering classes (the actually hard classes).\n\nI might do well enough this semester to boost my GPA even more. Since my finals are in mid-December, I might get my grades before the grad school application deadline (near January). Should I really wait to send in my application that long? Do those schools even care?\n\nMy research has also been not the best experience, too. My first year, I rarely showed up because it was boring. When I had to do a presentation at the end of that year, my lack of data (I didn't show up enough to do a sufficient amount of experiments) resulted in my adviser criticizing me extremely. The second year, including the summer, I decided to work harder, even though the research was ass-boring. I felt I did well, but when I presented my findings and proposed a new project (the current research was just so boring), my adviser didn't seem keen towards my proposal. Instead, he asked me if I liked the current research. When I told him no, qualifying that some of the previous experiments were worthwhile but the current project was a dead end, he told me to either leave or work on a new project with my grad student. I cried after the professor left the presentation; I felt he wanted me to leave and that he mentioned working on a new project only to be diplomatic. I eventually left the group because indeed no new project materialized, and I didn't feel the professor could ever write a good recommendation for me.\n\nNow I work in a new group. The professor definitely communicates more with me; the lack of communication might have been what caused the split between the old adviser and me. I haven't done anything substantial in the new group yet, though, so I am worried a lot. I don't know if I have enough research experience for grad school. And the new adviser is extremely nice; I don't know if that is preparing me for grad school.\n\nI am tempted to ask my former grad student/mentor for a letter of recommendation, since I did two years of research under him. But then he saw my lack of passion the first year and my breakdown at the end of the second year. Would he mention I cried under pressure by my old adviser? The one thing he did tell, when I left, was that I had on my ability to focus on tedious tasks; I was willing to do some of the most boring experiments for the overall project (grunt work?). And for some reason, the old adviser nominated me for a scholarship (I did get it), possibly because he saw my course grades or felt bad.\n\nSo, what are my chances at the following schools:\n\nUC Santa Barbara\nUC Davis\nCaltech\nUniversity of Minnesota\nUniversity of Michigan\nUniversity of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign\nStanford\nMIT (Not holding my breath for this one)\nUniversity of Wisconsin\n\nI've actually just started looking at grad schools/applications. So some other schools have caught my attention (McGill). Can you guys recommend any schools that might fit me more?\n\nI've actually got a ton of more questions about rec letters, so I'll post that soon, too.

D got into 6 schools with merit money, was waitlisted at 1, and denied at 4-- the waitlist and denials were the reaches. She has some very good choices, but still, she is feeling devastated, embarrassed and wounded.\n\nToday will be the day all her peers are celebrating their impressive acceptances and decorating each other's lockers with the appropriate college logos. Most of them made it into one or two of these most hotly desired East Coast schools or U Chicago. One even got into basically all the Ivys. But my D did not, and she feels like a big loser. She looks at the selectivity ratings and judges herself by that. Her friend who doesn't even have stats as good as D's got into a school that admitted just 7% of applicants this year, while the most selective school D got into admits around 40%.\n\nWe keep trying to get her to see that she cannot judge her worth in this fashion, but the culture surrounding her makes that very, very hard. One of her friends was denied at every school except for one, which has a 27% acceptance rate. But even though D got into 6 good schools and got scholarships at most, she thinks she did worse than this friend because of the selectivity rating.\n\nShe also compares herself to us, judging herself a failure because Dad and Mom went to two of these more prestigious schools, including one where D was just denied.  We try to get her to understand that it was a whole lot easier back then and that the school I attended was not nearly so competitive or so popular in my day. She actually did much better overall as a student than I did, and in a much harder school, but it's all so much more difficult now. I've been aching for her all night.\n\nI know it's a life lesson and that she has to come to terms with the fact that, to quote from Joan Didion's essay On Self Respect, \"lights won't always turn green\" for her. But it is so hard to watch her pain and disappointment. She feels that her \"best wasn't good enough\" and it's really the peer comparisons that make it hurt so much.\n\nTo H and me it just seems so arbitrary and unfair. Yes, some of these kids are either somewhat stronger students or harder workers than D, and even she acknowledges that. She says that so-and-so \"deserves it.\" But in other cases it's a mystery why a certain kid got into a certain school. No way is that kid more deserving or impressive than D, save for slightly better test scores.\n\nAnd on that topic, I have another gripe. Who knows how many of these kids got themselves diagnosed so they could get extra time on the tests? We know that some of them did, in one case a kid who is quite brilliant but has emotional issues, doesn't get along with her peers and has trouble controlling her temper. As D said, why should something like that get her extra time on the tests? But it did, and she made it into a school where D was denied. I'm sure the extra points helped.\n\nMy D actually has a diagnosis that could have gotten her more time, but she refused because she didn't like the whole idea and didn't think she needed it. She did well enough (we thought) without the extra time, but I am certain she would have done better with it. Who wouldn't? To state the obvious, the playing field is anything but level.\n\nTime to move on to choosing among her actual options. Unlike D, I know that they are not really \"second rate schools.\"  I have no doubt she will be fine and happy at any of them. I just had to get all this off my chest. One of the harder moments of parenthood.

I wonder what else people use.\n\n1. The Common Data Set. Schools fill out a thing called the Common Data Set, which they often abbreviate CDS. State schools generally have it stashed somewhere on their sites because the government requires a bunch of reporting, but many schools hide it or abstract out a few data points. I know there are threads with links to the CDS for some schools, but these tend to change and thus break. I find most by googling and looking around.\n\nWhen you read a CDS you realize the guidebooks take this material and format it so it looks like they've done more work than they have.\n\nMy belief is that a kid should look at a school that \"fits\" him or her and which has the program he or she likes. The CDS gives a window into programs, noting retention, how many kids are in each major - which indicates importance in a school and resources allocated - and a bunch of other real info. Kids hear a lot of absolute crap about schools from the most dubious sources so it's nice to be able to see actual facts. Schools brag about student / faculty ratios but you can often look at the actual numbers by department and thus by your interest.\n\nState schools often have entire research lists that go into tremendous detail. Private schools have much less. A few schools just post the CDS.\n\n2. ASEE. American Society for Engineering Education gathers material from almost all engineering departments - which now, of course, includes computers, biomedical, etc. If you go to asee.org and then to publications - the site is clearly organized by engineers (LOL) - and then to profiles, you can search for any program. Page through and you even get to how much money each program gets in external grant funding - government and corporate - broken down by department. So when a kid says, \"I want to go into engineering,\" you can look at how much research actually occurs at each school and then ask, \"Well, what kind of engineering?\" and look at which school gets money for that particular program. The differences are startling; schools get no money in some areas and tons in others so you can clearly see the strengths and research opportunities. Now when someone says, \"But x is great for engineering!\" you can say \"But y gets 3x more research money and x doesn't even get research money for z.\"\n\n3. Naviance. If your school doesn't have naviance - meaning a college application / guidance site powered by naviance.com - beat on them to set it up. Seriously. It's amazing. Naviance is a website that allows you to look at anonymous data for your high school's applications and admissions to schools. You can see basic data like the average gpa and SAT's for students admitted ... and then you can see the real data, which is all the applications plotted on a scattergraph with admissions, deferrals, etc. all listed. I say real data because some of the results are shocking - and kind of disheartening for many.

For example for my job I've had to create a java based GUI that connects some fortran based research models that are used by BSU's civil engineering department to monitor waterflow in the snake river basin, and then based on the results allocate water resources to things like recreation, industrial and municipal use, and power needs. Basically it makes their modeling quicker, easier and user friendly.\n\nAssuming that this GUI actually works as intended and does a good job would any college admissions actually give a crap about it? I'm really curious as to how real life, \"tangible,\" accomplishments are factored into admissions decisions because it seems to me that clubs and activities, while important, can create somewhat of a facade as to how capable someone in \"real life situations\". AKA people that just join clubs to put them on their application and then dont actually participate.\n\nAnyone tossing in their two cents would be greatly appreciated.\n\nPS sorry in advance about bad spelling and the over-usage of commas, its been known to happen :P "}, {"date": "2009-06-28T17:50:03+00:00", "url": "http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/transfer-students/737588-very-personal-life-story.html", "messages": "\n                    Hello\nActually, this is very personal and I did not intend to let anyone other than my family members to know about this, but\nI'm a Reagent Scholar and a neuroscience major at UCLA so basically, all my tuition fees including dorm are covered by the school.\nMy family immigrated to the U.S. about 3 years ago when my parents divorced and I started attending high school as a Junior.\nAt the time, my mother was applying for an E-2 Visa by starting her own company with someone but later it turned out that her business partner deceived her and took all of her money.\nEven in such situation, I tried my best at school to be successful so that I can be able to support my mother and sister.\nI managed to get straight A's in high school and was able to take AP classes and etc. starting my senior year.\nDuring my senior year, I accelerated my study in high school by taking AP courses and preparing for SAT exam.\nIt was then when my mom told me that my grandfather who died many years ago died of a disease called Huntington's disease, which is inheritable.\nSo, I had 50% of chance that I might carry the disease and I was tested to figure this out in hospital.\nDuring the winter break that same year, I got my result and in fact, it turned out that I had that disease in my gene and it is going to degenerate my ability of thinking and everything that defines who I am.\nI struggled the rest of my senior year since I could not acknowledge the fact that I was dying of some neurodegenerative disorder that I have never even heard of.\nI graduated from my high school and reluctantly went on to UCLA to continue my study.\nHowever, I lacked the willingness to study or basically do anything since I already knew that at some point in my life, my body would start to be hardened and I would lose control over my body and eventually die hopelessly.\nDays went by and bitterness grew inside of me and I actually attempted to commit suicide by taking pills because I was so depressed.\nBut I survived and even my own family was losing the hope to encourage me.\nOne day, one of my roommates recommended a book called the Last Lecture by Randy Pausch.\nThat book gave me a life-changing experience and basically became the turning-point in my life.\nI suddenly felt a huge responsibility over my life and decided to give a 1000% in my life everyday until the final day comes.\n\nSo, last month, I finally decided to stop my study at UCLA and start fresh at community college.\nSince I was very young, my dream was to go to either Stanford or Brown University. I realized that even though I have so limited time compared to other people, I wanted to achieve my childhood dream one by one.\n\nEven though I declared a non-attendance term at UCLA starting this fall, I am planning to continue my research at UCLA Medical School and internship at UCLA Medical Center.\nMy ultimate dream is to become a neurosurgeon/neuroscientist and get to the bottom of the disease to find a cure.\nSo, other many patients and their families do not have to suffer from this as much as I and my family did.\nI know some people would laugh at me and say it is not possible and I also know I cannot guarantee anything. But one thing that I know for sure is that I will throw my entire life for this without a single moment of hesitance and my desperateness will eventually get me there someday.\n\nHowever, I actually have no idea how the transfer process works, so if you are okay, I'd like to hear from you guys how this is going to work. Also, I'm planning to apply to those private schools right as soon as possible (right after my first year at CC?). Is it possible to get accepted to those schools since they are really competitive.\n\nThanks and have a great day!

It is a literary magazine for creative authors. We do publications in little booklets every month, and then at the end of the year we have a large book printed in color of all the works that students can buy for $10. The money we raise every year goes into paying for a coffeehouse held around Christmas time for students to come, drink coffee, listen to local bands play, and we always have a few creative outlets to entertain them with.\n\nI'm very involved in Theatre. I was in my 10th grade production of The Wizard of Oz (As a flying monkey, which I'm not ashamed to say. In fact, it was extremely fun, because we got to run down the aisles and scare all the audience members) and then last year I was a part of Anything Goes. I will also be involved in my senior musical, Bye Bye Birdie. There are about 12-14 weeks of rehearsal, and we spend roughly about 3-4 hours a day, 4-5 days every school week practicing, and then the final week, we are there all day sunday before opening week.\n\nI'm in the National Honor Society and the National Honor Society of Secondary Schools. I have aided in numerous drives and collections, as well as running the famous volleyball tournament at my school. It's a very popular event, where students come and \"Sleep\" over (But no one really sleeps) at the school. You can form teams and play volleyball in a tournament, or you can bring videogames, a guitar, anything your heart desires to entertain you and your friends. It's a great time. We also have a large project coming up for Senior Year in which those who enjoy creative writing, such as myself, will go and interview a Senior citizen at the local home and create a novel for that person about their life. I think that's so awesome...I get to write a novel, and to be involved in making someone happy.\n\nI'm also involved in a personal volunteer group, SHIP. It stands for Students Helping International Peace. We've been very busy this year with a number of projects. We have raised over 400 letters to send to the soldiers in Iraq. We had a massive book collection and raised about 1700 books to send to the children in Africa, sorted by age and genre. We are currently working on an Appalachia Project, collecting toothbrushes, shoes, clothing, and things of the sort for these people. We also have an International food festival planned for next April, the money raised will go to the Invisible Children fund in Uganda.\n\nHobbies:\nI am currently learning/teaching myself Japanese. I'm in love with Japan and the culture, and I would love to study abroad there during college. I have Rosetta Stone, which is extremely helpful. My love for Japan took off from my love of Anime and Manga, which I still love to watch and read, respectively. This stems from a love of foreign languages. I'm drawn to them, and I don't know why. Spanish wasn't my favorite, but I want to someday master English (Ah the work is never finished), Japanese, Mandarin Chinese, German, Russian, Hebrew, and Sign Language. I know a few words in sign language, because my mother used to teach it, but I really would love to learn how to communicate fully with a deaf person.\n\nI recently got into video editing, and I fell in love. I like making music videos, using Windows Movie Maker (Hopefully I'll upgrade to something better soon). I also make these things called AMVS, anime music videos. I take clips from an anime show or a video game, and I edit them and put a song to it all. It's a lot of fun, but it's also a lot of hard work.\n\nI love writing, if you guys couldn't tell already :P Sorry if I'm a bit longwinded. I've always had a knack for creative writing. I've written a couple of short stories on a writing website that have won Gold Trophies in contests, and I'm currently working on two novels. I have more than one because it breaks up the tedium. If I get bored or frustrated with how one is turning out, I simply focus my attention to the other and my motivation is restored.\n\nI'm a movie fanatic. I have my mom to thank for that. I'll seriously watch atleast 2-5 movies during a week in the school year, in the summer I lose count. I love all genres, and I love, especially, getting lost in the story of a movie. My mom tells me I should be a screenwriter, but I'm not quite sure. I would love to be a director, to really paint a picture that only once existed in my mind. Regardless, I've seen way too many movies, and I love watching indie films and foreign films. I actually prefer reading subtitles, probably because my affinity for foreign languages.\n\nProbably my biggest hobbie is music. I'm probably in love with music. I listen to it constantly, and I'm always on the search for new and unheard of artists. I've discovered a ton of underground artists who are more talented than the mainstream ones, and I've turned a ton of friends onto them as well. I listen to every genre, and I absolutely love to sing (Whether I can or cannot sing in a pleasing way, that is for you to decide ~ ) I actually discovered this Norweigan boy (You really should look him up btw!) named Sondre Lerche about 7 years ago. Since then, my mother and I have seen him in concert 5 times, and I met him on my birthday last year and got an autograph ^-^  Now that he's starting to pick up, he created the soundtrack for Dan in Real Life and appeared in the last scene :D I almost fainted x_x  Now instrumentally wise, I'm not the cat's pajamas. I know how to play a total of two songs on the guitar, Yankee Doodle and Ode to Joy. I do, however, have an organ and a keyboard down in my basement. I wrote my own song on the keyboard, and mind you I have no knowledge of musical language so to speak, and I think it's pretty darn decent! I'm taking a keyboarding class next year, so I'm excited to finally learn how to finetune my creations. I also would love to learn how to play the harmonica =D\n\n\nI'm pretty big into reading. I love reading Russian authors especially, such as Fyodor Dostoevsky, Nabakov, and Tolstoy. I recently finished reading The Brothers Karamazov, Lolita, and Anna Karenina respectively. I recently finished a report on Tolstoy's Religious Anarchism for my AP Composition class. I suppose it is because I'm 50% Russian that I admire them so much <_<   But no, really. I love the old fashioned sense of language that they implore. I'm not one for modern writers. It seems like these men really experimented with language and the plethora of adjectives and created a new way to write a novel. And that really inspires me. I try to avoid the common type of writing of the nowadays, and to really..go beyond that. The words escape me now even as I struggle to find a definition for what I mean, I apologize. I will say, however, that my favorite novel of all time is still For Whom the Bell Tolls by Ernest Hemingway. I was wary of the book that my teacher recommended, because I had read Old man and the Sea, and disliked it. Ernest Hemingway has definitely redeemed himself in my eyes. Also, if any of you would like to check it out...An author that is indeed strange..See if you can find Artaud Anthology. It is the workings of Antonin Artaud, a deeply disturbed but almost existential man. I love trying to find meaning in his jumbled up rants (Does that remind you of anyone, guys? lol)\n\n\n\nI think maybe with what I lack academically, perhaps I can make up with personality. I'm very polite to my teachers, and I'm really a student who wants to achieve. I'm at school to learn, and sometimes I do socialize, but I really look forward to actually learning. For me, knowledge was always something endless, always something that I longed to gather more of. I've seriously asked the weirdest, offbeat questions you could ever imagine, simply because my mind drifted away. I'm also always asking hypothetical questions, because I'm always curious of how the world around me works.\n\nAs for teacher recommendations, I'm getting one from my 10th grade english teacher, who was very helpful for me, school-wise and personal-wise. He really got to know me through some of the drama (Hey, it happens). We talked about the grateful dead (My mom's a big dead head, our sirius radio is programmed to the dead station :P) and about Mcfly and all types of things. I loved reading whatever he had to recommend, and he even let my date at the coffeehouse play his guitar (Which was a really expensive heirloom, so I was like O_O )  We've had a ton of really nice conversations about this and that, and I feel like I was very down to earth, very open and personable, and that I was always polite. I love my teachers (Yuck, I know what you're thinking, teachers pet) but no, not like that. I just like learning, and if they're good at teaching, I like them.\n\nI'm also getting the other one from my 11th grade Chem teacher who is also going to be my 12th grade AP Chem teacher. We get along very well, and she loves how many questions I ask, which are a little out of the ballpark. I volunteered to be the tester for the safety shower next year, which will be pretty fun :P\n\nDreams:\nI have had so many fleeting dreams in my short, or long depending on how you want to look at it, 17 years. There are a few that stick with me, no matter how much I evolve over time.\n\nI've always had an affinity for nature. I love the wilderness, and I become lost in it all the time. I've seen the movie Into the Wild (And I still need to read the book), as well as a few other selections from Henry David Thoreau (Walden, ofcourse) which have really inspired (Don't mind if I have a few outlandish dreams) to go live in the wild for a little bit. I doubt I could survive even a month, but to know that I lived, truly lived, for even a week on survival mode...That would really change everything that I know about living. And I'm always looking for those kinds of changes and adventures.\n\nGoing along with Alaskan wilderness, I've always loved the Iditarod. In elementary school, every year in math class, we would track the Iditarod race as a part of some project. And every year I would watch, and wonder..Would that ever be me? I'm no stranger to the cold - In fact, I love it. I love the snow..And I love the sledding dogs. Again, I probably wouldn't be able to even finish the race, but to just reach the first post in such an event..It's been something that I've always dreamed of doing.\n\nHaha, I'm pretty big into crime and what not. My mother reads True Crime, and I've read a lot of her old books, as well as watched a lot of nonfictional movies detailing crimes and the criminals, including some of the most infamous serial killers. I've always had a passion for CSI, and I even went to a CSI camp at Penn State main campus one summer. It was awesome; They set up a (Fake) murder, with real crime scenes, and real suspects. Then you had to go looking for clues, establish a motive, interview the suspects and then present your case at \"Court\" at the end of the camp. Not only did it ignite the flame within me for such a career, but it also showed me a little bit into college living. We stayed in the dorms, ate in the cafeteria etc along with real Penn State students.\n\nAnyways, I would love to study Forensics and perhaps acquire a job in the FBI, whether it be as a Forensic technician or as a linguist (I'm keeping my options open currently). That is one of the things that makes U of Chicago so appealing to me. Other than Washington DC, it's the best place to be for the FBI. I recently saw Public Enemies, about John Dillinger's bankrobberies in Chicago, and how the FBI sought to capture him. Hollywood glam aside, I really feel like Chicago is the place to be for me.\n\nI could keep going on and on, but I figure I should stop and let you add your comments and questions, and hopefully you aren't asleep by now :o  lol, but yeah. So please...Let me know what you think.  Be honest, be critical. I think I should be able to take it. I know the odds are looking a little weak right now, but that's when a miracle really occurs. I hope maybe the school really gets a feel for me in my interview and in my essays. That's really where my hope lies currently.\n\nAlso, what were the interviews like? I had one other interview at U of Rochester (My second choice school) and I thought it went pretty well. It was very laidback, my interviewer and I gushed over things like Bubble Tea, Robert Pattinson (Don't ask!), Computer Programming and the what not.\n\nAlso, question. I'm sorry, It's a bad habit v.v   Does anyone know if U of Chicago has a very rigid curriculum or if it's more open ended? We went to a local information session and the school gave a fabulous presentation (Ok, I might be a little bias to the others schools there) but I'm very curious. I need a lot of freedom to study what I want to learn. I'm very..all over the place. I don't think that's a bad thing, but I know that I looked at Cornell University (Yes, another stretch) and I hated instantly how they were like \"If your major is this, first year you take this this and this. Next you take this this and this.\" Etc. You only had about 5 elective classes for the whole 4 years. Uh uh, that ain't gonna work (Don't mind the slang.) So I was wondering where UoC fits into that ballgame.\n\nI want to learn Japanese as my language for college. But I also want to take C++ Programming (My friend is trying to teach me, but he says that it would be better if I had a professional teacher) And maybe I want to learn fencing. And maybe study film and linguistics, as well as international relations. I want to explore my interests until I find where I fit. I need a school that can accommodate that need.\n\nThank you very very much for all of your time, and for your responses.\nBrooke\n\nPS.

For me, knowledge was always something endless, always something that I longed to gather more of. I've seriously asked the weirdest, offbeat questions you could ever imagine, simply because my mind drifted away. I'm also always asking hypothetical questions, because I'm always curious of how the world around me works.\n\nAs for teacher recommendations, I'm getting one from my 10th grade english teacher, who was very helpful for me, school-wise and personal-wise. He really got to know me through some of the drama (Hey, it happens). We talked about the grateful dead (My mom's a big dead head, our sirius radio is programmed to the dead station :P) and about Mcfly and all types of things. I loved reading whatever he had to recommend, and he even let my date at the coffeehouse play his guitar (Which was a really expensive heirloom, so I was like O_O ) We've had a ton of really nice conversations about this and that, and I feel like I was very down to earth, very open and personable, and that I was always polite. I love my teachers (Yuck, I know what you're thinking, teachers pet) but no, not like that. I just like learning, and if they're good at teaching, I like them.\n\nI'm also getting the other one from my 11th grade Chem teacher who is also going to be my 12th grade AP Chem teacher. We get along very well, and she loves how many questions I ask, which are a little out of the ballpark. I volunteered to be the tester for the safety shower next year, which will be pretty fun :P\n\nDreams:\nI have had so many fleeting dreams in my short, or long depending on how you want to look at it, 17 years. There are a few that stick with me, no matter how much I evolve over time.\n\nI've always had an affinity for nature. I love the wilderness, and I become lost in it all the time. I've seen the movie Into the Wild (And I still need to read the book), as well as a few other selections from Henry David Thoreau (Walden, ofcourse) which have really inspired (Don't mind if I have a few outlandish dreams) to go live in the wild for a little bit. I doubt I could survive even a month, but to know that I lived, truly lived, for even a week on survival mode...That would really change everything that I know about living. And I'm always looking for those kinds of changes and adventures.\n\nGoing along with Alaskan wilderness, I've always loved the Iditarod. In elementary school, every year in math class, we would track the Iditarod race as a part of some project. And every year I would watch, and wonder..Would that ever be me? I'm no stranger to the cold - In fact, I love it. I love the snow..And I love the sledding dogs. Again, I probably wouldn't be able to even finish the race, but to just reach the first post in such an event..It's been something that I've always dreamed of doing.\n\nHaha, I'm pretty big into crime and what not. My mother reads True Crime, and I've read a lot of her old books, as well as watched a lot of nonfictional movies detailing crimes and the criminals, including some of the most infamous serial killers. I've always had a passion for CSI, and I even went to a CSI camp at Penn State main campus one summer. It was awesome; They set up a (Fake) murder, with real crime scenes, and real suspects. Then you had to go looking for clues, establish a motive, interview the suspects and then present your case at \"Court\" at the end of the camp. Not only did it ignite the flame within me for such a career, but it also showed me a little bit into college living. We stayed in the dorms, ate in the cafeteria etc along with real Penn State students.\n\nAnyways, I would love to study Forensics and perhaps acquire a job in the FBI, whether it be as a Forensic technician or as a linguist (I'm keeping my options open currently). That is one of the things that makes U of Chicago so appealing to me. Other than Washington DC, it's the best place to be for the FBI. I recently saw Public Enemies, about John Dillinger's bankrobberies in Chicago, and how the FBI sought to capture him. Hollywood glam aside, I really feel like Chicago is the place to be for me.\n\nI could keep going on and on, but I figure I should stop and let you add your comments and questions, and hopefully you aren't asleep by now  lol, but yeah. So please...Let me know what you think. Be honest, be critical. I think I should be able to take it. I know the odds are looking a little weak right now, but that's when a miracle really occurs. I hope maybe the school really gets a feel for me in my interview and in my essays. That's really where my hope lies currently.\n\nAlso, what were the interviews like? I had one other interview at U of Rochester (My second choice school) and I thought it went pretty well. It was very laidback, my interviewer and I gushed over things like Bubble Tea, Robert Pattinson (Don't ask!), Computer Programming and the what not.\n\nAlso, question. I'm sorry, It's a bad habit v.v Does anyone know if U of Chicago has a very rigid curriculum or if it's more open ended? We went to a local information session and the school gave a fabulous presentation (Ok, I might be a little bias to the others schools there) but I'm very curious. I need a lot of freedom to study what I want to learn. I'm very..all over the place. I don't think that's a bad thing, but I know that I looked at Cornell University (Yes, another stretch) and I hated instantly how they were like \"If your major is this, first year you take this this and this. Next you take this this and this.\" Etc. You only had about 5 elective classes for the whole 4 years. Uh uh, that ain't gonna work (Don't mind the slang.) So I was wondering where UoC fits into that ballgame.\n\nI want to learn Japanese as my language for college. But I also want to take C++ Programming (My friend is trying to teach me, but he says that it would be better if I had a professional teacher) And maybe I want to learn fencing. And maybe study film and linguistics, as well as international relations. I want to explore my interests until I find where I fit. I need a school that can accommodate that need.\n\nThank you very very much for all of your time, and for your responses.\nBrooke\n\nPS. I'm always open for any questions you might have  ^_^                "}, {"date": "2009-08-01T14:12:09+00:00", "url": "http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/parent-cafe/756856-what-are-your-views-on-legacies-and-affirmative-action.html", "messages": "\n                    So I am reading this non-fiction book (And Still We Rise: The Trials and Triumphs of Twelve Gifted Inner-city High School Students) about 12 inner city African American students in LA, California who attend a gifted program in this inner city school which is consisted of predominately minorities. This story takes place in 1996. During the time California voted to end Affirmative Action (Proposition 209). For those who don't know, Affirmative Action is the process in which colleges give underrepresented minorities a little \"boost\" in their application. Most people think that Affirmative Action helps minorities with very low GPA and test scores beat out rather smart Caucasians and in some cases Asians. However, statistics show that many of the minorities who are accepted actually have test scores and GPA similar and only slightly lower than their counterparts (Caucasians and Asians). These 12 students in this book are the last ones to benefit under Affirmative Action in California.\n\nFoes of Affirmative Action states that minorities with lower GPA and test scores should not get a boost and admitted to elite institutions because they won\u2019t be able to compete and will be demoralized. However, a study of the academic record and postgraduate lives of 45,000 students at 28 of the nation\u2019s most selective university over 20 years reveal a big contrast. This study (primarily on white-black comparison) revealed that the graduation rate among African Americans who entered elite colleges in 1989 was 75%. On the other hand, Caucasians attending these schools across the country had only a 59% graduation rate. The study also found that black students earned advance degree at the same rate as other students at elite university. What\u2019s more interesting is that African Americans actually earned professional degrees (law, business, medicine etc.) at a slightly higher rate. These black students were more likely to be involved in civic affairs after graduation than their Caucasian peers. (This book is called The Shape of the River: Long-Term Consequences of Considering Race in College and University Admissions. It is written by economist William G. Bowen, former president of Princeton, and Derek Bok, a political science and former president of Harvard)\n\nThey state \u201cA mandate to ignore race in choosing applicants would require that more than half of black students attending these selective institutions be rejected\u2026would society be better off as a result? Considering the educational benefit of diversity and the need to include more highly qualified minorities at the top ranks of professions, our finding convince us that the answer is no\u201d. Even General Colin L. Powell stated how absurd he regards the argument that blacks would be stigmatized by affirmative action.\n\nNow at the time California\u2019s governor was Republican Pete Wilson. He opposed affirmative action and campaigned against it. He persuaded the Regents of University of California\u2019s to prohibit affirmative action. He called this \u201cunfair\u201d. However, what is surprising is that he and the UC regents actually used their position to obtain admissions to University of California campuses for family, friends, neighbors and business associates and beat out better qualified applicants. They had their own \u201caffirmative-action program\u201d. This program benefited children of rich and influential white people, people Wilson said \u201cplay by the rules\u201d.\n\nAt most elite universities (Ivy League and equivalents), children of alumni-known as legacies-have a decided advantage (much like affirmative action, and in some cases, these advantages are much better than affirmative action). A report by the Berkeley\u2019s Institute for the Study of Social Change states: \u201cIn American higher education, far more white have [gotten admitted] to elite universities through \u2018alumni preferences\u2019 than the combined number of all the blacks and Mexicans enter through affirmative action.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. Department of Education\u2019s Office of Civil Rights conducted a two year investigation into Harvard\u2019s admissions after complaints by Asian applicants. The office concluded that whites were admitted to Harvard at a higher rate than Asians because of the number of students at the college who were legacies and recruited athletes-who had SAT scores about 130 points below the non legacy group. However, the office said that that it was \u201clegally permissible\u201d. And Asians are the most represented minority at Harvard. (It\u2019s worthy to note that minorities barely fell into the athlete and legacy category)\n\nHowever, affirmative action benefits in the case that a lot of minorities live in the inner city and can\u2019t afford to get good education. Affirmative action benefits in which a lot of these minorities can\u2019t afford to take the SAT/ACT many times and can\u2019t afford to take SAT/ACT classes (these classes can cost up to $1000 dollars for only a couple of hours, a price that most inner city kids can\u2019t pay). The reason why I say inner city is because a good percent of minorities live in the inner city and less wealthy areas. A good percent of minorities don\u2019t go to private schools. It has been shown that African American scholars do just as well as Caucasian scholars even when the black scholar was admitted through affirmative action.\n\n\nSo what I ask is: Do you think legacies are fair?  What are your views on affirmative action? What do you think about having legacies but removing affirmative action?\n\nSources (all facts are from):\nAnd Still We Rise: The Trial and Triumphs of Twelve Gifted Inner-city High School Students  by Miles Corwin.

I'll be starting my freshman year at the University of Nebraska-Omaha later this month.  It's really not ever where I wanted to go; it was a safety net that I was arrogant enough to think I wouldn't actually have to rely on.  Unfortunately, I procrastinated too much on my other college applications, resulting in some pretty bland, uninspired and glib essays being thrown on top of average extracurriculars and a teacher recommendation that I later found out was awful (not because of what she said about me - she was very complimentary and nice - but because it turns out this teacher couldn't actually write very well.  At all).  Therefore, I was waitlisted at Macalester, Oberlin, and WashU and rejected from Cornell and Columbia.\n\nI feel like I've learned a lot about the college process and myself in the months since, and I'd like to try it out again.  Right now, I'm torn about whether to apply to transfer for Spring 2010 or Fall 2010.  I know that the longer I wait, the less my high school record will count.  So I just wanted to get some opinions on whether (assuming that, this time I around, I fix my essays and get better recommendations!) my high school record and one semester of college at UNO is impressive enough to give me a good shot at the places listed below or whether I should wait a little longer.\n\nHigh school stats\n\nGPA: 3.92\nACT: 32 (36 English, 36 Reading, 27 Math, 27 Science)\nSAT: 2060 (800 CR, 500 Math, 760 Writing)\nSAT IIs: 740 US History, 750 World History, 770 Literature\nAPs not offered at my school, with the exception of AP Calculus.  And...uh, looking at my math scores, it should be fairly obvious why I did NOT take that.\nECs: School newspaper - 3 years - I was the editor my senior year and got 3rd place in Class C Entertainment Review Writing at State Journalism\nMock Trial - 3 years - our team was one of 12 that advanced to State Mock Trial both junior and senior year\nTheater - 3 years - I got a small part in one production my freshman year, supporting roles in two productions my junior year, and leading roles in three productions my senior year.

I'd also like to volunteer around the community more (I volunteered in high school, but that was because it was mandatory to graduate), get involved with Amnesty International or a similar humanitarian organization, and join a political group (eying the Socialist Alternative group at UNO hopefully...).

Please chance me based on my profile. My SAT 1 scores are not impressive. Will the rest of my profile in some way compensate for it? I will not be able to take the SAT again die to reasons mentioned in Misc #1.\n\nHere is my profile.\n\nTesting Scores:\nSAT 1 : 2000 (690 math, 630 Critical Reading, 680 Writing, 10 Essay)\nSAT 2 : Math 1 - 760\nPhysics - 760\nMath 2 - 690 (yes, I screwed up. Will use Score choice wherever applicable)\n\nWill take SAT Math 2, Chemistry and World History in December. Expect 760+ in all of them. Also TOEFL in December. Appeared for ACT in October, probably will have scores on November 10.\n\n\nGPA : School doesn't officially calculate GPA, but using their method of calculation it comes about to be approximately 3.95/4.0\n\n\n\nClass Rank : 1/385 throughout middle and high school, except for one semester in Grade 10. School is widely recognized in city as one of the elite schools.\n\n\n\nAPs : APs or IB are not offered at school. My school has an accelerated curriculum for all courses that is equivalent to an AP, although Physics, Math and Chemistry courses go much beyond APs. Here are my mid-year marks: (Considering the difficulty of the curriculum, school considers 80+ marks to be an A (there are no '+'s or '-'s) - this is mentioned on the transcript as well, although the rule of the thumb for other CBSE schools is that a 90+ is an A+.) Also, my school has a limit on the maximum number of courses a student can take - 5 subjects.\n\nEnglish : 90/100\nMathematics : 100/100 (Includes Calculus)\nPhysics : 97/100\nChemistry : 92/100\nComputer Science : 100/100\nSocial Sciences : 95/100 (Grades 9 and 10 only - Includes World History, Geography, Economics, Political Science, Disaster Management)\nForeign Language : 80/100 (Grades 9 and 10 only)\n\nI have similar grades, 2-3% lesser actually, but all 90+, in previous grades. I improved in Grades 11 and 12.\nI self studied all other courses offered but not available to me at school (due to cap on maximum subjects), did appear for their tests and topped, but they don't appear on my transcript. I requested my principal to mention this is her rec, and she probably did.\n\nImportant Awards:\n\n1. 1st position at the International Students Science Fair (ISSF)for my presentation on the future of computing and my paper for the same among 22 countries. Note : I was 14 at that time when the maximum age of participation was 18).\n2. 1st Position at Odyssey International English fest in the English Quiz among 7 participating countries. I was 14 when the maximum age of participation as 18.\n3. 5th position at Macfair International Computer Quiz. The quiz is for Grades 11 and 12. I was allowed on an exception.\nNote : Macfair is basically a math and computers event where a host of competitions take place with participants from many countries - don\u2019t remember how many. I was 13 at the time of participation when the maximum age of participation was 18.\n4. Won the 2nd position at the National Environment Quiz conducted by the Govt. of India at the national Level.\n5. Among the nation's finalists at an environment test organised by an NGO ATREE, went to an environment camp to study environment first hand.\n6. Huge pile of certificates and wins at the state level in oratory arts, quizzing, panel discussion, creative writing, build-it-from-scratch etc. Widely regarded as one of the best quizzers and orators in the state.\n\n\nSchool Positions Held:\n\nPresident/Vice President of every school organization there is except for one (commerce - I am ineligible to be a member).\nComputers - President\nOratory Society - President\nQuizzing Society - Founder and president\nSchool magazine - Director and Editor\nMultimedia Team - Head\nScience - Vice President\nCaptain of the school gymnastics team till grade 9\nHead of School's Student Council.\nAnd School's only Student Representative in History. Also only student to be head of all organizations I am eligible to be a member of in about 60-70 years of school's existence.\n\nNote : Generally membership is restricted to Grades 11 and 12, an in some cases, 10th. I have however been a member since grade 6 of almost all of these organizations. My principal said that she would mention this on her recommendation as well.\n\nECs:\n1. Built the computer cluster my school's intranet runs on.\n2. I helped another school organize their computer fest. Actually they particularly asked my school to allow me to help them. The commerce society (which i am ineligible to be a member of) often asks me to look over their organization.\n3. Taught a poor kid 2 hours (usually) everyday for two years now.\n4. Developing my own style of martial arts.\n5. Studied first year course for engineering by myself, nearly finished enough courses that I can go through my freshman year through Standing exams.\n6. Mentored a few students for quizzing, trained them personally for the quizzing society I founded and now they are winning quizzes all over the country. Analogous results at the oratory society. Grades 11 and 12.\n7. DIYing - Over the years I have built computer harware, software, electronics, faster bicycles. Nothing worthy of a patent though. DIY = Do it yourself; Geek speak for building things.\n8. Conducted a leadership workshop for Grades 10 and 11. (I know sounds wierd - a 12th grader doing this, but my school really insisted that I do it; they really liked the organization of various annual events).\n9. Generally play sports - Gymnastics, Tae Kwon Do, Boxing on my own, haven't participated much in high school leagues because my schedule and other activities do not leave me with any time. But in general, I am as fit as any other athlete should be. I did win many prizes at the national level in middle school.\n\nHonors:\nValedictorian, also will be awarded a \"Mr. (School's Name)\" title at graduation.\n\nJobs : Have worked as a freelance programmer/web designer/software engineer for an year (grade 10). Working at a 4-8 Job after school on weekdays and 9-6 on Saturdays since Grade 11 to date. 29 hours a week in total. I don't get paid - I do it just because I want to and for experience - otherwise I enjoy all benefits any traditional employee would receive.\n\nRecommendations:\nPrincipal : Best student in history of school.\nMath : Best student in career. Explained how I went out of my way to learn, emphasized on my research for the ISSF and my ability at math.\nEnglish : Best Student in career. Wrote about my character and my writing and oratory abilities.\n\nMisc :\n1. A lot of disturbances and violence at home, serious, but still I managed to keep my grades from tumbling. Home environment did not allow me to participate in international events such as ISSF again. I however made up by participating more at school clubs.\n2. Basically I have school to leave for school at 6:30 AM to 2:00 PM. I stay at school till 3:30 PM working with one of the organizations I am leading, job from 4:00 PM to 8:00 PM. Reach home around 9 and then after homework and other activities, I have no time left for anything else. mentioned this on app.\n3. Actually there were more things I wanted to mention, but I realized that i did not mention them when i submitted the common app, so i have not mentioned them here. Anything written here is also on my app.\n\nEssays : Generally I am a good writer and I think my essays have turned out well. (Wherever applicable) Wrote about how I overcame the disturbances at home and decided to make a life for myself ahead.\n\nMajor: Double Degree : One is definitely computer Science or CS + EE and the other would be a humanities/arts subject. Right now I am thinking of International relations/studies.\n\nFinancial Aid : Will need aid. Will be able to meet only 10% of the cost on my own.\n\nI am applying to the following schools; what do you think is my chance? I have only sent my application to Stanford so far, so do you recommend my adding or removing any names from the list based on my profile?\n\nMIT\nPrinceton\nStanford (EA - Application sent)\nHarvard college\nYale\nTrinity College\nCornell\nNorthwestern\n\nWhat (included in the list above as well as not included) schools should I take as safeties? I am sure I want a strong engineering department.\n\nThis was a very long description, and I thank you for reading the whole of it. Please do leave comments below. You can be brutally honest. :)\n\nP.S. Note: Just in case, I thought I'd mention for the 'difficult for IAs with aid' replies, Harvard, MIT, Princeton and Yale are need-blind, even towards international applicants. However this is not true for the other schools.

Electrical Engineering is in the same department and share a lot of the same courses the first 2 years as well. Some Engineering departments are better taught than others so I don't know how it is in other departments.\n\nThe bottom line is, 75% of the professors who I've had in Engineering/Physics/Math ect don't teach very well at all, that is a fact. They are there for research mostly and are required to teach classes.\n\nYou may get one or two good professors that actually do a great job organizing the class and the material but that is rare. Virginia Tech is a researched focused institution so don't expect outstanding educational quality in Engineering like I did, your in for a let down. The rankings reflect mostly the money put to research and the results...less on the education itself. If you plan to do research as an undergraduate...Virginia Tech is for you.\n\nThe basic classes for all Engineering students are rough in general and also lack great teachers but there are some good Engineering professors on that note but mostly upper level, you just got to do some research when signing up for classes. If you do get a good professor or one that sticks out...make sure to commend him/her and right a good review so other students know.\n\n\nIn particular for computer engineering they throw advanced programming problems at you 6 weeks into the intro level programming courses. It's taught with an assumption you've been programming for several years. It's not uncommon for students to repeat that course. I had to take it 3 times, first time was a drop and the 2nd a 69 when you need a 70 to get credit.\n\nSo if your in high school make sure you are well versed in C++. Electrical Engineering majors also need to take one C++ course.\n\nHere are my major points:\n\n****Make sure you are well versed in Calculus and Physics BEFORE college as all courses will utilize that knowledge. That is kind of obvious though but I really do emphasize that too.\n\n****Physics and Calculus are not as rough as the in major engineering courses if you form study groups and I got by first time around by studying and doing homework in groups and office hours if needed. It's advanced level though so they assume you know the basics and don't teach them.\n\n****A lot of the professors have foreign accents so it is hard to understand so be prepared.\n\n****The exams are very very hard and usually have problems much harder than any of the homework problems\n\n**** Most course grade layouts are as follows exams: 25-30%, Final 20-25%, labs 15-20%, homework/pop quizes: 10-15%\n\nSo usually the exams and the final alone are about 50-60% of your grade and that's how most students fail. So study a little each day, well actually that is the only way to pass. All nighters don't work as I found that out the hard way even though they did in High School.\n\n****Computer Science students: Be well versed in Java(primary language used) and good at math before college.\n\n****Electrical Engineering students: Know your basic circuits in High School BEFORE you come to college in particular RL and RLC circuits and the various methods to solving them, some AP Physics courses may introduce them but mine didn't and I was in for a surprise since the basics were ignored.\n\n****Computer Engineering students: Be well versed in C++ and good at math BEFORE college they expect you to know and don't teach you the basics like I had thought. Be prepared to spend 20+ hours a week doing various labs starting Sophomore year. Not every course has a lab but one or two a semester do.\n\n\n****All other Engineers: Same as above and prepare to work/study 30 to 40 hours a week with some lab work too. Everyone is different but the majority will have to work hard for C's and B's. That's right..C's and B's.... A's are harder but not impossible to get in college but maybe the top 2%-5% of the class get A's and they literally study all the time and have no job.\n\nSo make sure to get rid of that high school mentality of freaking out over anything lower than a B+ be happy your passing because some courses you will have to work hard for a C. Also be prepared for a course called \"Statics\" , I haven't had to take it personally but most of my friends have and I've seen the tortures they go through so be prepared.\n\n****45-60% exam averages are not uncommon too especially in physics and Calculus and more common in Engineering. Most professors do curve but not all, it's not uncommon to repeat a course so don't feel bad if you do, if you repeat more than a few Engineering might not be for you.\n\nI'm not trying to discourage anyone but just giving a heads up. If I could go back I would have utilized more office hours to get the professor to actually teach you any stuff you don't know or was assumed you did know.\n\nA good amount of friends I started off with freshman year switched to Business or another major by the end of Sophomore year so if your an Engineering major MAKE SURE it is really what you want to do and you are up for the challenge. The challenge I mean studying 30 to 40 hours a week to pass sometimes even more depending on who you are rare partying and very few if any extra-curriculars. I was told this and shrugged it off when I was a senior in HS and suffered the consequences.\n\nFinally be prepared to teach yourself most of the material on your own time or seek tutors, don't rely on the lectures or the notes as much unless you have a good professor and they are easy to follow, most aren't though. There are plenty of online resources. Sad but true.\n\nThe easy route if one would be to go 2 years at a community college then 2 years at tech for an Engineering degree, believe me.... I wish I had done that. They teach you the basics at community college and a lot of things that Virginia Tech leaves out. Trust me I took a semester at community college. It also saves you so much more money and you get the same degree from Virginia Tech as a 4 year student there.\n\nJust giving a heads up and feel free to ask me any particular questions too. Anyone else willing to shoot some advice please do. Just trying to better prepare incoming freshmen engineering majors.

She graduated in 2006. She fought with my mom tooth and nail for MONTHS because she couldn't decide where to go. She felt like she had to prove something to everyone, started dating a boy who narrowed her sights completely, zoned out of school, and put on 25lbs in the three months prior to graduation. She applied to eight schools (Clemson, Denison, Grand Valley State University, Calvin College, and a few others) and it really came down to GVSU and Calvin. She actually showed up to orientation at both places but finally decided on one. Long story short she ended up hating it and the lifestyle she started in those three months before graduation continued with a vengeance.\n\nShe's going to Community College this Spring and after a semester (or possibly a year and a half) will transfer into another school. I need help finding such a school. She had a VERY hard time finding a school, and actually sent out deposits to several schools. She feels like what she picks now, requires her to make a decision on her career as a freshman. So I turned to my trusty CC to help...\n\nRequirements:\n- Location: Preferably in the midwest (she lives in Michigan), but she looked at Eckerd College the first time around. No further west than the Rockies.\n- Tuition:  Isn't of issue right now. Definite plus for places with any applicable merit scholarships for transfers (though it would be up in the air if she would be a transfer or just considered a HS graduate with college credit, depending on the school)\n- Size: From approx. 2000-12000ish\n- Not very religious -- or at least socially tolerant. She just finished up a semester at Calvin College -- she attends church fairly regularly but was astounded at how much religion was in the classroom.\n- Internships/Fellowships: My mom wants a place for her (since my sister continues to be ambivalent even after the experience not caring got her)  where she HAS to have an internship (or a program like the Teaching Fellows at Elon) to give her experiences and help her develop a passion that neither my mom or I have seen since she finished diving. She thinks that she wants to be either a Marine Biologist, and Engineer or a Math Teacher\n- A decent Study Abroad program would also be a plus\n\n\nStats:\n- ACT: 22\n- SAT: took it, but for all intents and purposes n/a\n- School: Very competitive public\n- No APs\n- High School GPA: 3.4/3.5 UW 3.6/3.7 W\n- High School Extracurriculars: Varsity Diving Team all four years, Captain Senior Year\n- College GPA: n/a right now, will be the result of that one semester (or more) at Community College\n- College Jobs: Teaches diving for two separate teams. Our local middle school being one of them. Also volunteers at a local senior living home.\n\nThanks for any and all help CCers -- Mom and I are truly at the end of our ropes.

Ima try my best not to show any bias and give you a truthful, accurate representation of the camp based on my experiences.\n\nSo this camp costs 2700 for 6 weeks and includes room, board, supplies, field trips, food, and etc and compared to other camps, its actually pretty darn cheap. But 2700 dollars is still 2700 dollars and if any of you are interested in attending this camp, here are my experiences.\n\nWhat makes this camp special is that if you go to the camp for your 2nd summer and above, you get the chance to do a group research project with a professor at Texas State. Obviously, you can then submit your research paper to the Siemens competition and potentially earn a lot of recognition through you hard work.\n\nAnd yeah, this math camp is now quite famous since the first place $100000 team came from this camp and it has numerous semi-finalist and regional finalist. However with the glitz and glamour of this recognition, here is another perspective.\n\nBased on my experiences, I feel like they stack the teams. Like they purposely put all the smart math kids together so they have a better chance of winning; I can't blame them because the math camp is trying to gain more publicity but I feel like it is unfair to the other students. I have noticed that the URM kids are put together in the same group for the research team and for the 4 hour study groups in the evening. However, I'm not sure if they did that on purpose or on accident and if on purpose, if they had a good or bad intention.\n\nIn addition, the amount of actual \"classes\" you take as a first year is not worth it. Basically you are paying 2700 to take a number theory class and a mathematica programming class. They have something called Honors Seminar and Special Topics but most of the time it's just free periods where you get to goof off and play games. 2nd years and beyond take more meaningful classes such as number theory, analysis, and another math topic that gets changed every year and get to work on the research project.\n\nHowever the method they use to assign research topics is... unorganized in my opinion. Basically they send you a list of the title of the topics available without any description of what your going to do and you pick your top 3. Then they put you in groups without you having your say of who should be in your group. And if you get stuck in a bad group, the staff won't let you change it.\n\nIn addition the counselors, although geniuses themselves with many of them attending prestigious universities like MIT, Cornell, Caltech, UT, Rice, UChicago, behave like the math camp students. As a result a lot of them goof of during break periods and stay up into the wee hours of the morning (like 4 AM) and also kind of encouraging the first years to stay up late as well even though they shouldn't be.\n\nHowever the good thing about that is the atmosphere is very casual, laid back, and there isnt really a competitive vibe at camp allowing students to develop strong relationships and bonds with each other. And even though they do have a casual atmosphere, students still get a lot of work done in the 4 hour study sessions every night solving complex therems by writing page long proofs.\n\nOverall, most students love the experience at camp and they develop a lot of friendships through it. However as for the actual \"substance\" you will get from this camp, unless you are really gifted in math, you probably won't get much out of it because chances are you wont be placed in a good research group your 2nd summer. The proof writing experience you'll have is only for the higher levels of math contests like USAMO and is not very applicable to every day school math. I'm not saying you wont have a fun time because you'll have a blast as the math camp director is very nice, the staff is nice, and counselors are concerned about the students. However, just be aware of what might you be facing with if your going to spend 6 weeks and 2700 on something.\n\nI know some ppl might not care about the research project and might just like to solve complex theorems and write proofs. If this is the case, this camp is for you because they do a lot of that. However please be aware that in order to solve these proofs, your math level needs to be quite advanced or else you'll get very confused and be unable to comprehend what you are doing. At best you'll be able to understand how to solve something if somebody explains it to you, but you won't be able to solve it by yourself if your math is not advanced enough. Chances are if you dont know how to solve it by yourself, your going to forget all of the theorems you proved very soon after camp is over and everything you learned would just sink down the train. (No joke because that happened to me. )\n\nOverall the atmosphere and environment of the camp is absolutely amazing you yourself will be amazed by the talent of the students at camp. However unless you enjoy writing proofs or are very talented at math, this camp probably is not right for you. I know how they advertise it as a place where anybody can discover the joys of math and all, but honestly, from a frank point of view, you gotta already have a strong background in math to understand what on earth the people are talking about. If you are one of those people, then chances are you'll do very well with your research topic and place well at Intel, Siemens, and etc with your paper and you would benefit a lot from camp.\n\nAnd compared to Ross, this camp is like 180 in terms of atmosphere. At Ross, they do math theorems into the wee hours of the night, at Texas State, you play games until the wee hours of the night. It is extremely laid back outside of classes unlike Ross which is hardcore math 24/7 (slight exaggeration but still... very intense) but I stress that this camp still makes you do a lot of work, but just only during classtime hours and not outside. The staff is very nice and care about the students although what I didnt like about it was sometimes the counselors, being high school graduates or lower classmen college students, can sometimes be a bit immature and cause some camp drama themselves. However overall they are very fun ppl to hang out with.\n\nHope my review helped. :) "}, {"date": "2010-04-03T14:48:53+00:00", "url": "http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/sat-preparation/898327-i-really-dont-understand-how-my-essay-got-11.html", "messages": "\n                    Hello.

Since it's kinda late, I'd figure I might as well show it to you guys so you can see if you agree with me.\n\nBasically, it's a letter to John Gardner, the author of Grendel. Here are the instructions for writing the letter:\n\nYour task is to write a letter in response to Gardner\u2019s letter about Grendel and Beowulf.  In your letter, you should cover the following ideas:\n1.What is a hero? What is an artist? How are they alike? What does Gardner say about the role of the artist/\u201cShaper\u201d in society, in both his letter and in the book?   How does this relate to the concept of \u201cinner heroism\u201d that Unferth represents?  What can heroes and artists provide us with \u201cin dark times\u201d?\nWhat Beowulf says, in effect, is this: one looks at the world--bangs one's head against it--and one has two choices, to accept it as it is or to transform it, shake it to life by imagination. (\"Sing walls,\" Beowulf says. He means, of course, not just the wall Grendel's head has just banged but all life's walls--the walls which lock us away from other people, finally the great walls birth and death.) Grendel has asserted a dead, mechanistic world of brute accident; but by the accident of meeting Beowulf he's forced to discover how accident can be turned into a good, how imagination can reshape and ultimately improve the world--at least for the lifespan of a given civilization.\n2.Given the reality of Time and death, what choices does Gardner say we have in our lives?  What is the difference between \u201cshort-term gratification\u201d and the need to \u201cdream up a future better than the present and try to create it\u201d?\nHopefully all readers will recognize the central question, namely: if the world really is meaningless (as it now stands) how should I live? We all know that love sometimes dies, that people who at one time love each other truly and deeply may at another time stop loving each other. But \u2026 that is no reason for people to stop trying to love each other all their lives. In other words we don't need eternal values to assert and try to live up to eternal values.\n3.Finally, do you agree with Gardner\u2019s closing statement that \u201cGrendel is a considerably more optimistic book than Beowulf\u201d?  Explain, using quotations from both books.\n\nI thought I did a pretty good job at this, but my peers didn't. Here's my first draft:\n\nDear John Gardner,\n\nI recently read your book, Grendel, and it's very interesting compared to Beowulf. It certainly has a lot of the same themes that Beowulf does, but from different points of view. For example, in Beowulf, there are physical and spiritual heroes, but in your book, a new type of heroism (inner heroism) is introduced in which anyone can be a hero without being quite as strong or brilliant as real physical/spiritual heroes. Your book also deeply explains the Shaper's job and how he lies about the world or \u201creshapes it\u201d to make it seem better, while in Beowulf  he is just portrayed as a man who sings about the world to entertain people. Both books also discuss the meaning of human life in different ways. Beowulf simply shows that the Danes are existentialists, but in Grendel, existentialism and nihilism are thoroughly explored, thanks to Grendel and the dragon (so, monsters can allow us to understand the world more easily).\n\nHeroes and artists work together around the standards and values of normal people, and Grendel really shows it. You said that an artist, like the Shaper, \u201cmakes up a vision of the future, makes up glorious values such as heroism, queenliness, etc.\u201d, which is done as a result of choosing a way to live life (they make up their own values). Then, heroes become inspired by this poetry and these high values (called the projected possible) and strive to live up to these standards \u2013 they want to make that projected possible or better future a reality (and win fame, as well as other prizes, in doing so). In your book, Unferth tells Grendel, \u201c'Except in the life of a hero, the whole world's meaningless. The hero sees values beyond what's possible. That's the nature of a hero... it makes the whole struggle of humanity worthwhile.'\u201d (page 89, Grendel). This shows that heroes go beyond the normal standards, values, and what's thought to be possible (which is what makes them heroes).\n\n\nWhile Unferth talks about the nature of true heroes, he also represents inner heroism. Unferth acknowledges that he will never be the kind of physical hero that Beowulf is, and in doing so, he becomes an inner hero. He does the right things in society, and he makes the best of his situation, even if it's not the best at what he does (all of these \u201cpractices\u201d make him an inner hero). Unferth says, \u201c'A hero is not afraid to face cruel truth... No man above us will ever know whether Unferth died here or fled to the hills like a coward. Only you and I and God will know the truth. That's inner heroism.'\u201d (page 88, Grendel). This small speech shows how Unferth represents inner heroism, and it also shows that the Shaper's projected possible inspires everyone (not just heroes); everybody who listens to the Shaper can become an inner hero by, according to the values that the Shaper sets, doing the best that he or she can and following/striving for those values. This also demonstrates that the Shaper inspires people to live their life to their maximum potential by becoming inner heroes (if they can't become complete heroes). Heroes also inspire people by acting with/living up to the values/standards the Shaper sets. You said that, \u201cBeowulf has not only the physical strength to kill Grendel, he has the intelligence to force Grendel to see his mistake, or at any rate to glimpse it.\u201d This gives Grendel the joy that he feels towards the end of your book (Beowulf is actually a field of grayness to Grendel; he makes him experience joy and terror simultaneously).\n\nBesides the roles of heroes and artists, we also learn about existentialism and nihilism from the two books \u2013 the Danes are determined existentialists who acknowledge that nothing lasts forever (but at the same time strive for the best according to their values), and Grendel, being a confused outcast, develops a nihilistic philosophy and decides to cast away his hopes and values. Seeing as nothing will ever really satisfy Grendel since it all goes to waste anyway, he searches for short-term gratifications (events that will make him happy for short periods of time). For example, at one point, Grendel kills many of the Danes just for amusement (albeit his amusement dissipates quickly): \u201cI laughed... they came, they fell, howling... I saw myself killing them, on and on and on, as if mechanically... I saw myself swelling like bellows on their blood, a meaningless smudge in a universe...\u201d (page 81, Grendel). He doesn't need to kill the Danes; he's just doing it because he wants to and he knows that it won't matter in the end.\n\nOn the other hand, as you mention, one can make up values or follow ones that have already been put in place. This is different than Grendel's short-term gratification (nihilism) because it allows people to have something to live for in their lives (but at the same time, not be ignorant because they understand that the world will eventually end). As you said, \u201ceither you behave as if there were a god and try to determine what's right, in other words you make up values, you dream up a future better than the present and try to create it...\u201d. The other choice is that of nihilism where one \u201cscoff "}, {"date": "2010-08-14T15:38:04+00:00", "url": "http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/college-search-selection/980097-small-college-vs-research-university.html", "messages": "\n                    10 Reasons to Go to a Small College\n\nJuly 28, 2010 09:22 AM ET | Lynn F. Jacobs, Jeremy S. Hyman\n\nShare ThisOne of the critical decisions to make in choosing a college is between the research university and the small college. In the spring, we looked at the case for the research university. This week, we consider what advantages a small (or liberal arts) college has to offer. The typical small college is a school that has an enrollment of less than 5,000 students, doesn't have a graduate school, and has a student-to-faculty ratio of under 10:1\u0097some are even as low as 5:1.\n\nHere are some of the pluses of choosing a small college:\n\n1. You get small classes. Unlike large research universities where you could regularly find yourself in lecture halls with many hundreds of other students, at a small college you'll rarely be in classes of more than 50 students; in most cases two-thirds of your classes will have fewer than 20 students. (Again, the U.S. News Best Colleges rankings include the percentage of classes under 20 at each school.) The small class environment will give you a much greater opportunity to ask questions, participate in discussion, and have a professor who actually knows who you are. It's always nice to be a real person, rather than a nameless spectator in the crowd of a mega-university.\n\n2. All the teaching is done by professors. Since most small colleges only grant undergraduate degrees, they don't have graduate students. And if you don't have graduate students, you don't have to stick graduate students in the classroom to get trained on how to be a professor. This means that you won't have to deal with inexperienced TA's teaching your class. (It doesn't mean that you might not get stuck with inexperienced young professors. But with many colleges \"tenured in,\" and with not much chance for professors to change jobs in this ultra-tight economy, there should be fewer beginning professors compared to the steady stream of green graduate students coming into the research university.)\n\n3. Your professors will be more committed to teaching. At many research universities, \"publish or perish\" is still the phrase of the day. As a result, professors there who seek tenure and promotion have to make research their No. 1 priority and teaching, at best, No. 2. At small colleges, on the other hand, teaching is often the main criterion for advancement, so the professors will put more effort into preparing their classes and, often, into developing new classes.\n\n4. Your work will be evaluated more carefully. In larger schools, professors, TA's, and/or graders have to rush through huge stacks of papers and exams to grade (that is, when they haven't relegated the grading to a computer), so they don't have much time to offer feedback and suggestions on individual pieces of work. At small schools, the professor will have more time to read your work and offer detailed comments. While to some this might seem intimidating, it's one of the best ways to learn and grow intellectually \u0097if you actually pay attention to the comments, that is.\n\n5. You'll have a chance to write more papers. Grading papers is quite time consuming and papers are one of the first things to go when an instructor is faced with a large class. The limited size of classes at small colleges, though, makes it possible for professors to assign more written work (or other sorts of projects). This is important because the more you write, the better you get at writing. And with the rise of the Internet, communication skills are becoming more and more important compared to just memorizing lots of facts. It's also likely that you'll have more of a change to do bigger projects, such as junior papers and senior theses, usually with one-or-one supervision by a real expert.\n\n6. You'll have more opportunity for one-on-one contact with your professor. At the big universities, your professor may just be a speck in the distance, someone you would never dare approach. But at small colleges, you will get to know your professors and they will get to know you as well. You often will get better advising than you would at a larger university and this professor will actually know you when the time comes for getting a letter of recommendation for graduate school or for an employer.\n\n7. You'll have more freedom in the curriculum. Often smaller colleges are more flexible about requirements and give you more leeway to construct programs that meet your individual interests. Some even allow you to design your own majors or don't have majors at all. What's good about this is that you can take only the courses that you want, rather than sitting in on endless classes that the \"college\" or the \"department\" thinks all students should take.\n\n8. You'll have more opportunities to collaborate with a professor. At larger schools, the are endless hordes of graduate students waiting in line to partner with a professor in his or her research program. At smaller schools, it's the undergraduates who are called upon to look up the sources, help conduct the experiments, and often even write up\u0097or present at a conference\u0097the findings with the professor. And it not just a work-saving move for the professor; part of the teaching mission at many small schools is to engage the students in the research of the faculty\u0097sort of a shared experience rather than a one-way communication of information.\n\n9. You'll face less bureaucracy. At small colleges you will be spared the endless lines at registration, the hand-to-hand combat to get into closed classes, and the sprinting between innumerable offices to try to get your simplest questions answered. Sounds like a good deal, doesn't it?\n\n10. You get the feeling that you count. Large universities can be very alienating places. There it's easy to feel that no one cares about you and whether you learn anything. At most small colleges, they have room to care. Group hug, anyone?\n\n\u00a9 Copyright 2010 Professors' Guide LLC.

I just recently finished my additional information, but I'm still unsure about a couple of things\n\nHere's how it goes:\nOn my Junior Year, I participated in a very complex, but rewarding, project known as Integrated Project (IP). IP is a yearlong commitment that requires continual involvement. It requires a team to choose a time period and thoroughly research it, as it would be carefully examined and critiqued by my AP US History teacher. By the end, I had over ten pages worth of social, political, economic, and daily life information of the time. It requires the team to use the researched knowledge to create a presentation, which includes a play and film.\nMy project involved the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) during the Reagan Era. The first half of my presentation captured the subculture of fear of Nuclear War during the time. The second half offers a 'what if' SDI was real, and the Soviet decided to try to bomb the US. The result would take too long to explain, but the audience reaction would not. The audience found the presentation humorous, education, and overall fantastic.\nI was the group leader, director, video editor, researcher, video editor, co-scriptwriter, and actor in my group for this project.\nIf interested,\nHere are excerpts of the hour-long IP presentation.\nYouTube - IP Presentation- Beginning\nYouTube - Scene- Tony runs away from home\nYouTube - Scene- Reagan Day\nThe live presentation was captured on film. Unfortunately, the quality of video and audio are not exactly ideal. Standoff in Space on Vimeo\n\n\nQuestions:\n1. Do you think the officer will actually watch all those videos? I would love it if anyone who has actual knowledge of the process chimes in.\n\n2. Should I upload the video of the end, with the crowd\u2019s applause? I mean it sounds kinda self-indulgant on paper, but maybe colleges would like it, as a verifier of the project\u2019s actual success. What do you guys think?\n\n4. Should I rephrase what I wrote or is it just fine?\n\n5. Should I upload any other parts of the play?\n\nThanks guys, sorry for the so many questions but I\u2019m just really unsure about everything hah. If you don\u2019t know any of the questions, that\u2019s fine. Questions and comments are welcome.

I only have one final left, and have a decent idea of the grades I\u0092ll get, so I thought I would write a little about my transfer experience. Plus, I need a little break from studying.\n\nI transferred to UC Davis. I had the choice of going to UC Berkeley, UC Santa Barbara, and UC Santa Cruz. I was really tempted by Cal, but for those of you who will be on the fence between two or more schools, I just want to say that I have never regretted my decision. I picked UCD because I loved the town and knew I would be happy here, and I was right \u0096 that definitely made my transition easier.\n\nWell, orientation sucked. I mean, it was great until it came time to pick our classes. Continuing students had higher priority over transfers, so at first, I only got one class I wanted. It was incredibly frustrating, but during Pass 2, I managed to get in all the classes that I needed.\n\nI was a little worried about getting used to the 10 week system, but I actually didn\u0092t have any trouble adjusting. As it turns out, I actually prefer the quarter system better, as I don\u0092t get burnt out during Week 13 or something.\n\nAlthough there is more reading at the UC level, I think I\u0092ve been pretty lucky. This quarter I had four courses and read two textbooks, two novels, and many, many articles. In all, I think I only read about 100 pages a week \u0096 which is more than I read in community college, but easily manageable. I was a fairly good student, but I was never very good with time-management.  I ended up attending a Time Management workshop and they gave us a mini-calendar of the quarter. It all fit on one page, so students could mark off which days they had essays due, midterms, etc. That way, a student could see ahead of time that he or she would have two essays due on the same day or something and prepare for it in advance. This may sound stupid, but being able to see all my deadlines really helped. If you\u0092re a procrastinator like me, I suggest either getting or making something similar for yourself when you transfer (or even now, it\u0092s still useful).\n\nI didn\u0092t make many friends at my CC, so I resolved to get more involved after I transferred. I joined MSU (Mixed Student Union), volunteered at the Cross-Cultural Center, and was a volunteer Outreach mentor (went to high schools & helped prepare minority students for college). Getting involved made school much more enjoyable (although, I already loved UCD to begin with), so try to find something you like once you transfer.\n\nI\u0092m a French major, and due to a very interesting Linguistics Course I took, am currently torn between double-majoring in American Studies or Linguistics. These were the courses I took Fall Quarter:\n\nFRE 23 (5.0) \u0096 Intermediate French (last course before upper division)\nLIN 01 (4.0) \u0096 Intro to Linguistics\nNAS 01 (4.0) \u0096 Intro to Native American Studies\nFRS 02 (2.0) \u0096 First Year Seminar\n\nOf course, it\u0092s not necessary to take a seminar, but they do come with benefits. My seminar professor gave the class tickets to plays, concerts, etc. at UC Davis\u0092s Mondavi Center, which was awesome.\n\nThis quarter, I wrote a total of eight essays, including two research papers. I\u0092ve gotten A\u0092s and B\u0092s on my essays. I only had two midterms (LIN and NAS), which I received 88% and 100% on, respectively. I\u0092ve spoken to three of my professors during their office hours; they do seem harder to reach at UC\u0092s, but TA\u0092s are pretty helpful.\n\nRegistering for classes does seem to get easier. I just had my Pass 2 for Winter 2011, and I got in \u00be classes I want, and I\u0092m only #2 on the waitlist for the last class.\n\nLet\u0092s see\u0085I transferred with a 4.0 and right now, I know that I will get all A\u0092s, all B\u0092s or something in between depending on the results of my finals. The average transfer student drops in GPA during the first quarter, so I\u0092m actually pretty happy with my grades. Also, it does help that I did not work during my first quarter here. However, I plan on doing research next quarter, as well as starting an internship, so we\u0092ll see how my grades fair then.\n\nI can\u0092t think of anything else to mention, but if you have any questions, feel free to ask.

I just got finished taking the GRE about an hour ago and I can't help but feel a little gutted.\n\nMy scores weren't terrible (750Q, 590V) but I was expecting much more than that (I would prefer a higher Q score especially).  750Q only puts me at a little over average for mechanical engineering applicants according to ETS powerprep statistics. :(\n\nThe real reason I feel gutted is because I do really well in math and I've been preparing for the GRE for some time now.  I started reading and going over vocab as early as last summer and starting early December I've been studying all three sections of the test.  Three weeks ago I took a GRE Powerprep test for the first time (which is supposed to be a good indicator of how you actually score).  I got a 780Q, 660V.  I decided that this was a good result for my first practice test but that I shouldn't get complacent.\n\nSo I took more and more practice tests, worked through lots problems in Barrons and Princeton Review and in their practice tests, developed strategies, studied more vocab, etc... fairly intensely up till test time.  The day before the test I was consistently scoring 800Q on powerprep and all my verbal scores had always been atleast above 640 on powerprep (I got a 730 on one).\n\nThen I go to take the actual test, and after all this work, I get LOWER then what I got on powerprep in the first place.  I realize that the GRE is only one consideration out of several in grad school admissions but I am aiming to get into a top 10 mechanical engineering grad school (i.e. MIT, Purdue, Cornell, Caltech, etc...) and I was really hoping to get a good GRE score and be done with this.\n\nI'm especially concerned about my GRE score since my school (University of Louisville) isn't particularly prestigious in engineering (atleast not on a national level) so some schools, especially ones that are farther away, might attribute my high GPA (3.9) to grade inflation unless I have GRE scores to back it up.  (FYI, my school is actually notoriously difficult in engineering regionally and GPAs at the school are far from inflated).\n\nI'm not going to be applying to grad schools till this winter so I have time to take the test again but this still sucks.  I put in all this work so that I would not be in this situation but it happened anyway.  Anyone been in this type of situation or have advice for me?\n\nAdmittedly, half the reason I'm writing this is just to vent but I'm also looking for ideas on what to do.  Should I be as worried as I am about a less than perfect math score?  Should I definitely take the test again if I want to go to a selective engineering school?  Should I try different studying techniques?

I joined this site when I looked up \"How to get accepted into Phillips Exeter Academy\", and I was led to this community site. While I was reading the thread that I had been led to, I got a feeling this was the site where I would be helped sincerely.\nI am going to tell a story now, so if you don't like stories, please do press that back button and not leave hurtful comments please.\n\nBackground Info: I'm Asian. (Explains most things about me.) I live in Los Angeles, CA. Not the richest, but not the poorest either. Been taking piano lessons for 9 years until I quit 3 years ago. Current 8th grade at a public school. Figure Skater, never went in competitions though. (But this is the sport I love most and want to pursue.) Playing flute for 4 years, currently on hiatus, playing in my free time. (Again, no awards. Yet.) Math Olympiads Highest Individual Score 3 years ago (not important, but Im proud of it.) President's Award 3 years ago when graduating elementary (not important but still, I like saying this, makes me feel important.). Assorted collection of Awards from basketball, water polo, junior lifeguards, piano, and synchronized swimming. (embarrassing to say, most of them are \"most improved player\" awards. :S)\n\n\nSo while I was applying to the Ten Schools (you know what they are) I got lazy and the only application I completed was Exeter. I didn't take any SSAT prep classes, or tried studying hard. I did take the ISEE to see what it was like, since they are similar. When the results came, I thought I did pretty good. 78%. Yeah, as a fresh 8th grader, I was proud to be that score with a test taken by up to 12th graders. But that was only my fantasy. Because I didn't take up to reality. I knew straight As were a given, and since I had straight As and taking the highest honors classes, I thought I was in. I wrote an essay that I myself was very proud of. My English teacher told me he didn't believe I wrote it because it was so good. So there I was, full of myself, so sure that I was a future Exonian. The more I saw the video I was sent, the more I looked through the courses booklet, I felt getting more and more absorbed in the thought that I would be packing soon and taking my flight to New Hampshire. My transcripts were sent, and I had my whole future planned out. I would go to Exeter, be in the Harkness Table. Find my true inner strengths academically. Study French (because I am self-taught, but I suck) and Animal Behaviour. Go to M.I.T. to study medics for animals. Get a license. Go to Harvard. Study law. Get degree. Have a job in the Supereme court doing cool juries on Animal Rights. Even though I was 14, I had the brain of a 5-year old. This \"plan\" I had was equivalent to my cousin's \"I wanna be a princess\" future. But I never realized this till the admission decision email. Yep, got turned down. Not even waitlisted. I can translate their \"I am very sorry but honored..\" to \"Arrogant fool, you think this is a joke? We are THE rich people school. Go away.\" Haha, I was pretty stricken. I dropped my phone (i was reading the email from it) and bawled. This was in my house, at night. I went to my parent's room, and mom tried to console me. Didn't work, so went to the roof of my 12 story building, and cried, looking at the moon. I didn't know why I was crying, the shock was still settling in. Since this was thursday evening, I went to school the following Friday. I went in my pajamas, all depressed. When my friends did the usual \"are you okay\" rounds was when everything finally sunk in. My future, my plans, shattered. No alternate paths. Nothing in front of me, no more stepping stones. For the whole week I cried myself to sleep. But I know that this experience had matured me. If I were to be really accepted, I would never have tried my best, do things the easy way. In all honesty, I suck up to my teachers, never really study for tests, and I never did try my best for my applications. I was pushed to try harder, and I set a new goal, graduate in AT LEAST the top 10% in my middle school. I am actually going to open a book and study. I was blessed with a talent for memorizing things, but I never really used it. When I read in CC about the girl who was the class president of 900 students, captain of VA volleyball team, 99% on SSAT, I sank more into self-regret. Can you see how ashamed I would be? A mere straight A student, not trying hard, and proud of 78%. No awards, no captain, nada. I'm in yearbook, for goodness sake! So this is my review on my non-acceptance into Exeter. As they say, a blessing in disguise. I will try again to Exeter, apply to other schools with it, and actually complete applications. I also want to admit, my applications were completed a few days after the deadline, because there was a delay in transcripts. I am going to be a better and renovated applicant, someone who actually tried their BEST. Not have stupid fantasies about doing things the easy way. I am going to win awards, and be the best of best, not \"good enough\". So this was my share on Exeter Admissions.\n\nP.S. I would like to sincerely apologize to all the other applicants out there, to have someone as low as me be competeng with them. I promise in the future, I will be a worthy enough opponent.

Several examples from history and current events prove that my viewpoint is legitimate. The process of doing something will always prevail.\n\nThrough the actions of Robert De La Salle, we can see that his preparation to discover the North West Passage was better than the actual outcome. In the late 1860's, a French explorer named Robert De La Salle spent many months preparing for the expedition of his life. He wanted to be the first man to discover the infamous North West Passage. For the to happen, he had to devote his life into drafting several maps of the North American terrain for his planed through the cold waters of the St. Lawrence river. The was pretty tedious and left him unable to sleep for weeks. Furthermore, the actual expedition was a complete flop. The vessel Robert De La Salle was pull off its intended course by strong currents and was sent traveling down the Mississippi river. As a result, instead of discovering the North West Passage, he claimed Louisiana for France. Thus, Robert De La Salle got more of a reward when he was drafting maps of America than actually looking for the passage way.\n\nHayao Miyazaki, a Japanese animator, proved to the world he loves making animated films more than accepting awards. In 2001, Hayao Miyazaki\u0092s \u0093Spirted Away\u0094 won best animation over Treasure Planet and Ice Age at the 77th annual Oscars. When the awards host at the Oscars announced the films win, Hayao Miyazaki didn\u0092t come onto the stage. In fact, he didn\u0092t he attend the award ceremony in sunny L.A. California. Furthermore, back in Akenbono Japan, press questioned Mr. Miyazaki at Studio Ghilbi. They wanted to have a clear explanation to why he was absent at the Oscars. \u0093I have more glee when I pull out a sheet of paper and draw my characters,\u0094 he stated ,\u0094 that I think accepting prestigious awards is a bit trifling.\u0094 Thus, Hayao Miyazaki\u0092s absence at the 2001 Oscars proved he holds his hard work more momentous than accepting Oscars.\n\nAfter a critical analysis of Robert De La Salle and Hayao Miyazaki, hard work is indeed better than its outcomes. Had Robert De La Salle and Hayao Miyazaki been asinie, they would have not been have any outcomes. The process of working should be a reward in itself.\n\n "}, {"date": "2011-04-06T22:18:22+00:00", "url": "http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/financial-aid-scholarships/1122259-advice-appreciated-scholarship-appeal-canada.html", "messages": "\n                    Hi,\n\nI\u2019m not sure if anyone here will be able to provide me with information that I need, as I live and will attend school in Canada. However, this is the only forum that I have found that discusses the issue of financial appeals, and I would appreciate an educated opinion.\n\nI come from a very low-income family (single working parent in skilled trade, four child home, no financial assets). I cannot expect family financial contribution for my post secondary education. Fortunately, I will be able to live at home for the duration of university; however, my family\u2019s financial situation is such that I must contribute in some part to household finances. We just moved cross-country from British Columbia to New Brunswick. I was previously set to attend university in Fall of 2010, but had to defer admission due to a sudden loss in the family.\n\nI can really no longer afford to attend university in my home province \u2013 I would have struggled in any case with the price of tuition, so the price of residence is out of the question. Happily, I have the opportunity to attend a university in New Brunswick that is even better suited to me. I met with an admission counsellor before I applied, and she guaranteed me a minimum scholarship based solely on my grades. The scholarship is awarded to students with a calculated admission average of 90% or higher \u2013 my average is 95.5%.\n\nIn addition to my grades, I provided two letters of reference from two veteran teachers who told me that they counted me amongst the top five students they had ever taught. I provided evidence of the many academic honours I had achieved in my final year of high school. My high school was extremely successful and competitive, and BC is second in the country for quality of education. I compiled a summary of activities. I summarized my capabilities and passions, both of which I felt set a place for me in the highly active extracurricular scene they pride themselves on.\n\nToday I received my scholarship offer. They chose to offer me the minimum amount \u2013 the amount guaranteed by a 90% admission average.\n\nA little background on both the universities at which I am accepted (and although the numbers I\u2019m about to give may seem petty in the US, they mean the world to me):\n\nThe university in NB is a liberal arts school consistently rated as the best undergraduate university in the country. It has the highest per-student endowment in the country, at 49,000. It has an enrolment of approximately 2,600, which is kept low as a part of the university\u2019s appeal. Tuition is 6,700 per year.\n\nThe university in BC is often counted as the best comprehensive university in the country. It has a per-student endowment of 7,000, and an enrolment of 25,000 undergraduates and 5,000 graduates. The admission requirements are actually slightly more stringent than at the NB university. Tuition is 5,200 per year.\n\nFrom the BC university, I was offered 5,000 a year based solely on my grades, with 3,300 renewable annually with a 3.50 GPA. From the NB university, I was offered 1,500 renewable annually with a 3.7 GPA.\n\nYou may know that BC is a very wealthy province, and NB one of the poorest. I feel that the university may have overestimated my financial capability for this reason. In fact, my family moved to BC when trades work was scarce in the East. We moved away because, after 18 years, the cost of living had far outweighed the work opportunities, and my family was left in debt.\n\nIn my application, I didn\u2019t want to blame my background or make excuses for what might be seen as a lack of accomplishment. My parents (the world\u2019s best, actually) were never able to afford music lessons and sports, and without higher education themselves they were not able to prepare and coach me for application to university. I have, on my own initiative, developed a number of skills and passions, and I am dearly hoping that university will give me the chance to expand. I am afraid, however, that they are not quantifiable, and I can see how that might give reason to doubt the prospect of my contributions.\n\nMental illness runs in my family, and I have spent the better part of my life depressed and at times suicidal. Depression took my mother. Still, I have intellectual and creative capability that I have put to good use in an academic setting.\n\nI know that extenuating circumstances, such as those I have described, can be weighed against a perceived lack of demonstrated ability. As I said, I was reluctant in my application to make excuses for myself or use my hardships to gain sympathy and reward. Now I have to hope that a better explanation of my background may yield better results.\n\nSo, my questions:\n\nWhy would a university, seemingly better financially situated and with higher tuition, offer such meagre financial aid?\n\nNow that the scholarship decisions have been made, is it really worth appealing? If so, what, of the information that I have here described, might actually help my chances?\n\nThank you,\n\nKate                "}, {"date": "2011-05-20T00:10:34+00:00", "url": "http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/summer-programs/1150008-collected-responses-about-ross.html", "messages": "\n                    Over the past year I've posted a lot about my experience at Ross last summer both on the site and at art of problem solving as free spirit. Given that the responses are in like 8 threads on two sites I've decided to try and collect all my responses in one thread. This will also be posted on art of problem solving.\n\nFrom the 2010 Ross thread on college confidential\n\nshushugah, I don't think it makes sense to compare the camps from best to worst. The camps cater towards different interests. For example, if you want to spend 8 weeks doing math almost constantly Ross is probably the best choice. But if you want to do things that aren't math related Ross isn't as good of a choice. From what I've heard HCiSSM places a large emphasis on its inside jokes and having fun. Awesome Math seems very geared towards competitions. Mathcamp seems to focus on various interesting subjects of math. Ross and PRMOYS are both entirely number theory. Another consideration is whether you prefer to work alone or in groups. At Ross working in groups is generally looked down upon. Often times at Ross you might spend hours or even days working alone on one particular problem. My understanding is that the doesn't really happen at other camps. While spending 8 days on one problem like I did at Ross last year might simulate actual reseach it wouldn't be very helpful in terms of math competitions.\n\nIn terms of instructors, I'm only familar with Ross. The instructors are good but most of the learning you do by yourself anyways so they're not that important.\n\n\nGlad to have helped. At Ross, there is an hour of lecture each day and 3 days a week there is a 1 hour seminar. The lectures generally either explain new concepts, explore interesting tangents, or will go over old problem sets. The seminars are run by different people and some of them explore more tangential stuff like set theory while others focus on discussions of problems from the problem sets. Another important thing to note is that you work at your own pace. Oftentimes, a lecture will go over a proof from an old problem set so if you're going at a fast pace you'll have proved it by yourself but if you're going slower they'll give you the proof sometimes.\n\nFrom the 2011 Ross thread on college confidential\n\n\nThe instructors are professors either at OSU or nearby colleges.\n\n\n@kgppra053420 Essentially, the Ross program is doing number theory problem sets. The only required activites are 1-2 hours of class per day Monday-Friday. The rest of your time you can spend as you like though you will be expected to spend a lot of it working on the problem sets. The problem sets are composed of a mixture of numericals, where you will look at patterns and formulate conjectures and theorems to prove. Some of the problems are trival, while others are extraordinarily difficult. After you finish a problem set, you'll turn it in to your counselor. Then after a day or two usually you will meet with your counselor and discuss the set. Although different counselors have very diffirent methods for doing this, you will usually be expected to redo any problems you didn't solve correctly the first time. The rest of your time can be spent exercising, with friends, or doing other stuff although generally you won't have too much time for this. The quality of life is also pretty good. You'll get a 2-room dorm and will have 1 roommate. You'll also get a meal card, which allows you to get more than enough food. The food is also of pretty quality as well but the lack of choices can get old by the end of the summer. If you have any more specific questions, I'd be happy to answer them as well.\n\n\nThe facilities are pretty decent. Our dorm building last year was pretty old but the dorm rooms themselves were nice and had a bedroom with bunk beds, a study room, and a bathroom. There was some communal rooms in the dorm where a lot of people would hang out. Although I never went to the athletic center, I heard it was of excellent quality. The student center where most people ate is also very new. Sets can either be done alone or in groups of people of like 2-3 people although there are no hard rules regarding this. You certainly would be able to work with your roommate as long as both of you pulled your own weight but not nobody will force you to work with them or anyone else for that matter.\n\n\n@kgppra053420 Ross is pretty strict about not letting you bring laptops. If you have a specific purpose that you'll need one for they may allow you to bring it for that purpose only. However, while it is not exactly true that there are computers in the dorm, you can go to the campus library to use computers. Although the counselors will be unhappy if you spend too much time using the computers, you will be able to use them for pretty much whatever you want to do.\n\n\nYou will probably initially be a bit behind but you should be able to catch up pretty quickly if you are well prepared. Some people came late last year and it certainly didn't effect them by the end of the summer. I am not positive that they will send you the work you miss but I've heard that other places and would think that it is probably true.\n\n\nI don't think Ross is terribly strict on its no leaving policy. If you have a good reason, they should be fine with it. If your reason is not so good, they'll probably grumble but let you go anyways.\n\n\nThe Ross program gives a list of course topics here: The Ross Mathematics Summer Program for high school students, held on The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio. I wouldn't worry about looking like an idiot due to lack of talent. Ross will only accept people who will be able to do decently well if they work. The people who do the worst at Ross are without exception those who are too lazy to work hard. I wouldn't recommend studying number theory before coming to Ross; you'll do more than enough number theory at Ross. However, if you want to prepare for Ross I would recommend working on proof writing. I think you'd be better off studying something like logic or set theory before coming to Ross.\n\nRoss will not allow you to bring a laptop for gaming. Although playing games on library computers is technically prohibited and will make the counselors like you less, plenty of people do it anyways and they won't actually stop you.\n\nPeople spend wildy varying amounts of time on the problem sets. Some people might only spend a couple of hours a day on math although those people don't do that well. Others will spend like 12 hours a day every day on problem sets. I think it takes the average Ross student 2-3 days to do a set although there is wide variation. You can work in groups or by yourself. Although it is kinda frowned upon if you come up with the solutions with other people it is not prohibited and it is certainly acceptable to bounce ideas off other people. People at Ross are on about every schedule imaginable. Some people work in the morning and afternoon and relax in the evening. Personally, my schedule was roughly like this\n9 AM wake up and go to classes\n10-11 AM after classes have lunch\n12 PM go back to the dorm and take a nap\n4 PM wake up and either work or go to the library to use computers\n6 PM dinner\n7 PM -4 AM work on problem sets\n4 AM go to bed. Every week there is a frisbee game and some weeks there is another scheduled activity. For the most part though, free time is yours to use as you wish. Some people like to go the gym or hang out. You can also take a break more or less whenever you want as long as you remain productive.\n\n\nStudents are not allowed off campus without a counselor. However, there is a CVS on the far side of campus and counselors routinely take people to the closer one as well. There is a also a university bookstore on campus but I think those are only two place you'll have easy access to. There is a movie theather near campus but I don't think students are normally allowed to go there. Essentialy, there are 5 major rules at Ross:\n1. Get problem sets done at a reasonable rate\n2. Don't leave campus without a counselor\n3. Be in the dorms after dark\n4. Go to the 1-2 hours of classes a day.\n5. Don't possess prohibited items such as laptops.\nOther than those 5 rules, your behavior at Ross is more or less unrestricted.\n\n\nThere are no classes, so most people sleep in. You're expected to work on math for part of the time but the rest of the time is free. I guess at Ross the line between free time and math time is very blurred. Some camps might be like 4-6 work on math and then 6-8 free time but at Ross other than for classes all the time is free but you're expected to get stuff done. There were certainly weekends where I was on set [at Ross you're said to be on set if you've finished all the problem sets handed out so far. in the beginining there are typically a small group of people on set which shrinks until more or less everyone is no longer on set] and spent little to no time during math. Even if you are never on set, you could probably take a day or two off from math if you really wanted to.\n\n\nI'll be coming back as a junior counselor. I'm not sure if you're allowed to use all the athletic facilities but I know you're allowed to go the main gym center. I think some people played tennis but I'm not sure. I assume you'd be allowed to bring a racket but again I'm not really sure. To be honest, I never used the athletic facilities although I think almost everyone else did.\n\nSo my friend tells me you're allowed to use 'Everything but rock wall, basically'.\n\nFrom the thread PROMYS, ROSS, or mathcamo on art of problem solving\n\n\n\nthink nikeballa96 describes Mathcamp and PROMYS pretty accurately but isn't as familar with Ross. I went to Ross last summer and will return this summer as a junior counselor. Another important difference between the camps is how much time is spent learning techniques and theorems compared to how much time is spent proving theorems. My understanding is that Mathcamp is more like a regular math class in this regard and that classes due to their short length just go over the major results. At Ross however you'll spend most of your time coming up with proofs. I think PROMYS is somewhere in between in that everyday you try to prove some theorems and then you get solutions at the end of the day. I would agree that if you're into competition math then go to Mathcamp. If you want to focus on number theory than either PROMYS or Ross. I would say go to PROMYS if you care about having fun but go to Ross if you want to truly learn math as the longer and more intensive experience allows you to come up with some really deep ideas.\n\n\nMaybe this is just my skewed perspective but I'm not sure PROMYS is just as intense as Ross. For one Ross is about 2 weeks longer than PROMYS which is something to consider. Maybe I am mistaken but I was under the impression that at PROMYS every day you get a problem set, work on it and then at the end of the day go over it with your counselor. Maybe this is wrong but at PROMYS is everyone working the same set? At Ross you spend as much time as it takes to solve all the problems on the set which can is some cases be more than a week. This leads to by the end of camp some people being on set 30 and others on set 10.\nI agree that both are overall at the same level and have similar levels of students. I think there are stylistic differences between the camps though as some people from PROMYS have talked about spending time exploring Boston. I'm sure that's what some people want to spend their summer doing but that's not what people at Ross do.\n\nFrom the thread PROMYS and Ross on art of problem solving\n\n\nFor a general overview of the two programs, you should look at each program's individual thread and the thread comparing Mathcamp, PROMYS, and Ross. Ross and PROMYS are actually pretty similar as PROMYS was created to be like Ross. Here are some differences though\n1. Ross is 8 weeks and PROMYS is 6 weeks. This allows you to do considerably more math at Ross but at the cost of more of your summer. I think the programs charge similar amounts of money so Ross is considerably cheaper per day.\n2. Ross is Columbus, Ohio and PROMYS is in Boston. Although Columbus, Ohio has to be one of the most boring places in the US, the lack of interesting surroundings helps you focus on math. I heard at PROMYS people explore Boston which may be exciting but probably does not encourage doing math.\n3. At Ross, first years are not allowed to bring laptops. I think PROMYS allows first years to bring laptops. I can imagine that laptops would signigicantly cut down on mathematical productivity although they would allow you to play more games. At Ross you can still use computers in the library but you have to be in the dorms after dark. At Ross you can also get yelled out for playing computer games. I do not know the policy for this at PROMYS.\n4. At Ross first years focus pretty much exclusively on the number theory problem sets. According to the PROMYS thread, some first years at PROMYS do some kind of research thing which does not seem directly related to the number theory problem sets.\n5. At Ross you work at your own pace so different people can be working on very different stuff at any given time. By the end of the camp, the number of sets people have done resembles a bell curve. The top students are usually on sets 25-30 (there are 31 sets and typically one student every 2-3 years finishes all the sets). the good students are on sets 20-25, the average students on sets 15-20, and the lazy students fail to finish 15. At Ross if you do something wrong on a set you end up redoing the probelm.\nI'm not entirely sure how PROMYS works so if someone who went there can correct me if I'm wrong about this that's be great but I think at PROMYS you get a problem set every day similar to Ross but then you go over it with your counselor at the end of the day. I think this means that at PROMYS everyone is on roughly the same set and if you don't solve a problem you'll eventually get a solution for it.\n\nIn conclusion, I think at Ross you'll end up doing more math while at PROMYS you'll end up doing more other stuff.\n\nIf you have questions that aren't answered in any of these posts feel free to ask and I'll do my best to answer them.

I remember raising this discussion more than once, and I wish it was no longer an issue for me but it's still there.  This is the first summer he stayed on campus in his apartment, so he's not living here, so perhaps the lack of communication is wearing on me more since he's been home so little\n\nHere's the deal---he's a terrific student---4.0 both semesters this year.  He got enough scholarship money that our only contribution consists of buying his books.  We do maintain the old van he drives, and pay for his cell phone and of course clothing and health insurance etc. so I wouldn't call him completely independent, but he's a lot closer than some.\n\nBut---and as Pee Wee Herman said, everybody I know has a big but---I just never hear from him unless he wants or needs something.  I've tried for four years not to take it personally.  I've given him his space.  Kept visits short and minimal, rarely call unless I have a reason to, and only the occasional e-mail or facebook post.  I don't want to be a pest, and I don't want a relationship with him based on a sense of guilt and obligation. Truthfully though, I thought he'd come around a little more as he matured.  I thought if I gave him lots of space he'd eventually want to see and hear from me.  It's hard not to take it personally and I'd be lying if I said I wasn't completely devastated.  We didn't have any issues or problems when he was growing up and I think if you asked him he'd say he had a happy childhood.  The only thing that might be a cause for complaint was that our house was where all his friends hung out, so he might have felt I was a little too omnipresent in his life.  It's not like I was hanging out in the basement with his friends.  My main contribution was to make food and keep the fridge stocked.  I was friendly, but I never pretended to be friends with his friends.\n\nBut this is an example of how our interactions now go:\n\nI call him because a friend is taking her son to Bloomington for a day on campus and asked me if I'd like to ride along.  I let my son know that I'll be in town, and I'd like to buy him lunch and take him food shopping or whatever he needs.  He asks when we'll be having lunch.  I say noon.  He says he guesses he could do that, but he'd have to set an alarm.  He stays up very late and generally sleeps til three, but I've never said anything because again, he does well in school and who am I to complain about him being nocturnal if he doesn't even live here.  He's very slow to answer texts, so a day passes and it's getting close to when I'm supposed to be coming, and I'm still not sure if he wants to meet or not.  I text him and say they've got a 10a.m. appointment, so I could have them drop me at the apartment, and though I know he'll be sleeping I could get his keys and take his van for an oil change.  He said,\"Well, I guess you could do that but Chris is visiting and he's sleeping on the couch so you'll have to be very quiet.\"  I make some joke about not wanting to wake Chris and say I'll text him when we're headed to lunch and he can meet us if he wants to.  I do that, and he doesn't respond for over an hour and then texts, \"are you still eating lunch?\"  We were just finishing up, so I said yes but I'll order takeout and you can come pick it up.  He seemed genuinely happy to see me, and we spent a couple of hours at his apartment before it was time to meet up with my friend.\n\nSo here's the thing, I think it's incredibly rude to not be able to get out of bed and meet me, but I'm not saying that because hey, he's a college kid and blah blah blah.  I don't want to be this dictatorial bore who demands things from him and never treats him like an adult---the way my mother-in-law treats her son.  On the other hand, I'm really freaking fed up with this.  Later this summer he was passing through town on the way to a concert and first it was---hey, might be coming through with a few friends to stay Friday night.  Then it became, not sure if I'm stopping Friday night or maybe stopping by on the way back. Fine.  Just let me know. Of course he didn't let me know until he was actually leaving Chicago and on his way back.  I get it. I know these kids don't plan.  They never know what they're doing.  But still.  I'm to the point where I don't even WANT him to come home, because I won't have a clue when he's coming, when he's leaving, and he'll stay up late and sleep til three so what the hell good is that anyway?\n\nI did take him to task once during the spring semester because I had written an e-mail with several questions and he responded---two days later---\"your e-mails are like homework!\"  And I said yes, they are like homework and that's because I don't want to call you because you don't like to talk on the phone and those e-mails should really be phone conversations.  He said he was happy to talk on the phone to me and preferred that over e-mail because he does so much writing for school.  He said he gets busy and neglects the people that truly matter.  Nice to hear.  But it didn't seem to make him any more considerate.  And forgive me, but he's taking 15 credit hours and he's a communications major. Really, you're not that busy dude!\n\nThe problem is my strategy of just letting it be is not working for me any more.  I can feel this building up of hurt and anger. I feel like a chump.  I know right now he's running low on funds and the financial aid won't disburse for a few weeks.  He posted on Facebook that he cashed in his change jar and doubled his money.  I posted that I recently saw a documentary on tunnel dwellers in NYC and that would be cheaper than his rent---and then I said,\"or you could just call your mom.\"  That was three days ago.  No response.  No phone call.  I think he wants me to put money in his account without having to actually ask for it or talk to me about it.  When we talked about it through texts last time I suggested maybe he could come home and help me paint the bedrooms and then I could pay him and pay his rent. He said,\"I could do that.\"  But notice that's not the same as \"I will do that.\"   I understand why that's not wildly appealing.  He thought his savings would last through the summer and they didn't---see Chicago concert reference above.  He waited too long to look for summer jobs and thought applying online would net results without following up too much in person.\n\nSo how do you parent a 21 year old? Do I just flat out say I think he's inconsiderate and rude?  It seems unlikely he'd respond well to a lecture.  Do I just ignore the fact that he's out of money until he calls me and asks for help?  I could give him the money now and then tell him to pay for his own books.  It's not exactly even because his books are cheaper than his rent, but it's not too far off.\n\nAnd really, I can't force him into anything other than this perfunctory relationship we have now.  So do I just let go and expect I'll get a Christmas card every year if I'm lucky?  I know lots of people that demand a weekly phone call from their college kid, but it's too late for that now.  I'm afraid that in trying to let him have his space and freedom, I've actually helped create a self-absorbed jerk.                "}, {"date": "2012-03-13T08:18:45+00:00", "url": "http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/prep-school-admissions/1302763-ask-a-deerfield-graduate.html", "messages": "\n                    So I understand that many of you Deerfield applicants have or will receive your decision in a few days. I had posted some answers to questions in the \"Ask a Freshmen\" thread, but I just wanted to make a new thread title in case any of your were ignoring the freshmen threads and want the thoughts from a recent graduate. So good luck on your decision and feel free to ask away. Nothing is off limits.\n\nBelow are the old questions/responses to avoid redundant questions\n\n\nA moderate amount. There will always be a group of students drinking before dances. The two biggest drugs used are weed and adderall/ritalin (mainly by the male students). There is not drinking and partying in the dorm every weekend as many students find it is not worth it and amuse themselves in other ways. If a student wants to be part of it, they likely can, if they want to avoid it, they can as well.\n\nNow away from Deerfield is a different story. Students from many different backgrounds and many different social groups at school get together on long weekends/vacations and party. There are many students who refused to drink or do drugs at Deerfield but feel perfectly comfortable doing it on these weekends. Some parents knew this and sheltered their kids from these breaks. Ultimately they did their child a disservice in two ways. First, they removed them from their classmates during times when everyone was relaxed and bonding. They therefore missed out on many great stories and shared experiences. Second, when some of these kids wound up on college campuses the results were disastrous. I know many parents think their children won't binge drink because they have been raised well, I can tell you that is a naive view to hold. Let you children get exposed to drinking in high school with their friends, not when they show up to college with many unknown people in an unknown environment.\n\n\nNot many at all. I'm not sure where the freshmen are getting there numbers but while 88-91 is the average range, above 93/94 is generally top 5% of the class. I believe our classes top two students were 95% or 96%. Basically it's hard to get below an 85 but hard to get above a 93.\n\n\nVery fair question and one that the answer will vary slightly by year. First of all, there is a limiting factor that there won't be any venue or house that can hold all 150 students on a long weekend. Tho two times that generally all can be accommodated are senior spring break (Nassau) and the first clump of senior parties. Sadly these come at the conclusion of ones Deerfield tender. Nassau is also generally limiting but we were lucky to have 3 students with homes there, so that helped to alleviate some of the parental tension and financial tension for their friends.\n\nThe second limiting factor is that if a student has an empty house or parents that are willing to let them make use of the house they tend to want to keep the numbers down (especially if their parents are monitoring) and like to limit it to their friends. The largest event I can recall was a 100 student (combination of two grades) get together at a bar/restaurant followed up by a few smaller more exclusive parties.\n\nFinally it is important to note that while everyone is quite friendly at Deerfield and I think its one of its best attributes, when people tend to have close friends, they tend to come from similar backgrounds. There was not one group of friends; however, I can point to that came from all one background or one region. The largest group of friends, in our year, was dominated by boys & girls from the NYC,CT&LI geographic areas. Included however were students from California to all the way to Bermuda. That group was also fairly close with a group of lower income boys from the same area and I felt they always treated them with respect. The lower income girls did not appear to ever be close with the girls in that group of friends.\n\nSo when it came to these parties and vacations the initial factor was friends. If a party had a limit it was filled with one's close friends first. Now these parties were initiated by many different groups of friends so it was always possible that the larger or popular groups were excluded. People generally were very loyal to their closest friends and there is very little social climbing as most students feel very secure with their friends and their place within the Deerfield community.\n\nI apologize for the long explanation, and I realize I may not have gotten my point across. Let me try and conclude. Lower income students who left for the long weekends could almost always find a party or event to go to. There failure rate to find a party was the equivalent of the wealth students. Was there always one big party or one city that everyone conversed on, no, this only happened occasionally. That said I never felt that income or friend group was a limiting factor on the fun one could have on a long weekend. Friends were always sharing rides and Deerfield offered buses back to NYC. Did certain group of friends not want to party, yes, they would go home and they enjoyed that too. Effectively a lower income student never was excluded because of their income.\n\nExtremely little. This was actually one of the ironies that came up frequently on campus with the administration. They wanted to take away large monitors and projectors as they felt they were items of have/have-nots. Yet there were about equal number of students that came from low income backgrounds and high income backgrounds that had these devices. Eventually it was dropped our year (although I believe later reintroduced).\n\nAnother item that comes up is dress code and this applies more to the female half of campus. For the men it can be quite had to distinguish between somewhere wearing a $500-1000 outfit to class or one wearing a $100-200. For the girls, it becomes much more apparent and I believe actually affects them more. The boys can wear the same blazer and tie all week without anyone noticing, caring, or saying anything. The girls cannot get away with wearing the same top or dress all week. The school does provide funds for those who need it for uniforms but it tends to only solve the situation for the boys not the girls. Sadly I'm not quite sure how to fix this as even if the school provided more to the girls on FA, the wealthy girls would certainly go out and buy more expensive clothing and jewelry to distinguish themselves.\n\nI also should clarify that with both of these answers I'm not trying to pick on the girl subculture at Deerfield but it is generally harder to fit into and I have known multiple girls (from all walks of life) that struggled with it. Possibly because all girls can somewhat feel like they are always trying to fit into the male dominated Deerfield culture. The boys all tend to mesh better regardless of the backgrounds, its not exceptional, but its pretty good.\n\n\n\nWill there be pressure on the students to succeed both academically and athletically, yes. Does it compare to the pressure that would be placed on the same student as Andover or Exeter, no. We highly value our accomplishments in and out of the classroom but most of the pressure appears to come from within and from parents. Different students will feel more or less stressed and pressured at different times during their tenure at Deerfield. The school is competitive but it is done in a lively manner and students don't tend to be lampooned by their peers for falling short. Everyone is going to fail at some point.\n\nCollege acceptances certainly raise the competitiveness and anger will ensue when a student feels that they were turned down for a less qualified Deerfield student. That said, the power of the Deerfield community tends to keep this to a minimum and the community really does a fantastic job of keep spirits high. I remember talking to two students who were displeased with their final choices and I believe I was able to help both of them. I also know many others who did the same. So yes, pressure will exist, but it is certainly not a pressure cooker school.\n\n\nNot a chance at Deerfield. The school and faculty are extremely accommodating for outside activities even when not connected to the school. I never knew a student who wanted to participate in any Extra Curricular and wasn't able to do so. The more you take on, the less free time you have, sure; but if you can handle it the school won't stop you. If a debate, conference, or competition take you away from the school for a week they happily accommodate. Dr. Curtis does a fantastic job of congratulating students for their outside endeavors and accomplishments.\n\n\nI've seen both. Entering as a 10th grader is standard. Half of the class does it, so it is normal. Entering as an 11th grader is a little more difficult; however, most times by the fall break they already have close friends. Living in dormitories does wonderful things for friendships. The school has mandatory class events and trips in an effort to promote class bonding, but I doubt this is any different than other top boarding schools. The biggest aspect that I feel is different about Deerfield is our community. It is an amazing feeling to walk around a campus and have everyone wave and say hi. This is not just some face that gets put on for visiting students, it actually happens. I never experienced this anywhere else. As a new student it is a remarkable feeling and makes you feel welcome.\n\n\nOh boy.\n\nI wouldn\u0092t change anything major and much of what I\u0092ll list below is a list of classic complaints from a high school student. The largest thing I would have changed would have been the removal of two faculty members who consistently made life miserable for students. One of them has already been removed/left as far as I can tell.\n\n-The sexual intimacy policy: Everybody knows what goes on with students during co-ed visits. Which is why some faculty overlook this rule and let it go on. Other don\u0092t. So as you\u0092d imagine the students know when and where to do certain things. It becomes a somewhat comical joke and a game. I understand the school needs the rule for legal reasons and to somehow ease the nerve of protective parents but it is impractical and needs to be addressed. When a student is caught in violation of this rule the book is thrown at them. There is also a policy on lights/lighting during these visits, don\u0092t get me started\u0085\n\n-Housing: It should be simple, but it\u0092s not. Every year there is a flaw that allows disgruntled students to claim the process was unfair or not transparent enough which is why they claim they were giving bad housing. Have a open lottery and let students pick their room.\n\n-Internet: It shuts off at 11. This is silly considering most students have smartphones with internet. There was also a group of students that managed to hack the internet so it worked all night for them. Another outdated rules that just irritates students.\nThere is probably more to add, but I just can\u0092t think of it right now. If I do later, I will post it.\n\n\nPeople will know who is on Financial Aid and who isn\u0092t. It\u0092s a small community and many openly talk about it. Quite honestly it would be more awkward if there was a conversation going on about Financial Aid and a student people knew was on it, kept their mouth shut. It would seem they were ashamed and Deerfield respects openness. There are plenty of ways people will know if you are on Financial Aid, it\u0092s not a big deal, and nobody is going to say anything about it. I never once overheard a student being picked on in public (or in private) for being poor or on Financial Aid.\n\n\nIf they are home they absolutely know. I\u0092ve seen parents provide the alcohol. A word of advice: You\u0092re children WILL drink in high school. Provide them an environment that is safe and controlled for them to do it. As I said earlier, the parents that did everything to protect their children in high school ultimately failed them. The most protective parent I knew, her child was in the hospital first semester of college. Enough said.

I want to write down some things I learned along the way so that future ACT takers will benefit. However, before I get to the tips, I would appreciate it if you helped my out and clicked the link below. I'm about to go to college next year and my parents need to save money so I'm trying to get some money for myself online anyway possible.\n\nPlease visit my site: ACT Tips: Science | Quazen\n\nHere is the same information you will find on the site above:\n\nACT: Science\n\nThis started out the hardest section for me. When I started studying, I had a 24 and when I took the ACT, I got a 33. Here are some very useful lessons I learned along the way:\n\n*Timing is the key to getting a good score on this test and many of these tips are to increase efficiency to save time.\n\n*Not all these tips will be useful to all people so if something isn\u2019t working for you, don\u2019t follow it. However, please give this advice a fair shot.\n\n*USE A TIMER. When I took the SAT, the timer was not really necessary because there was no real time crunch. However, on the ACT, the time crunch is everything so using a timer is very helpful to see how long you have beeen working on a passage. If you have been working on one passage for more minutes than there are questions for that passage, go to the next passage.\n\n*Answer the questions first. When you fllip to passage, read the questions first EVERY TIME.\n\n*If the question refers to a graph or table, go to that figure and study only what the question is asking for. For example, if the question asks for the general trends for water level and plant growth as time increases, look at only those on the graph even if there are lines representing other results.\n\n*If the question refers to the passage, skim the passage for keywords. You DO NOT have to read the passage because reading will slow you down as you try to understand all the technical terms.\n\n*Read a question once. If you do not understand it, read it again slower. If you don\u2019t understand it the second time, skip the question and come back to it after you finish the section/passage.\n\n*The order that you answer the passages doesn\u2019t matter as long as you are concious of your time.\n\n*When practicing, time yourself by type of passage:\n-On the ACT, there are three kinds of passages: short(4-5 questions), medium(6 questions), and long(7-8 questions). These passages have different content and types of questions.\n-Regardless of the types of questions and the content, time yourself passage by passage and give yourself as many minutes as there are questions minus one. For example, I would give myself 5 minutes to do the medium sized passage.\n-Once you are able to meet that standard, take the science section together and if all goes as practiced, you should finish the science section with 2 minutes left to check over answers you skipped.\n\n*Knowing science helps. By that, I mean that taking physics, chemistry, biology, enviornmental science, geology, etc. at your school helps but it not a prerequisite. This will mostly help because much of the material is easier to understand if you have taken a similar course already.\n\n*Use the knowledge you learned in class. Many of the scientific experiments that are given in the ACT science section are labs done in class and ,usually, the data and other information that you learned in class can be used to solve the questions for those experiments. This saves tremendous time because you don\u2019t even have to look at the graph or the background information.\n\n*Recommended Study Materials:\n-Barron\u2019s ACT 36 (about at level of actual ACT)\n-Peterson\u2019s Real ACT Book (these are actual ACT tests)\n-Princeton\u2019s 1,296 Practice Questions (more time consuming that actual ACT)                "}, {"date": "2012-10-22T00:59:09+00:00", "url": "http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/other-college-majors/1405964-to-stem-or-not-to-stem-college-major-troubles.html", "messages": "\n                    I'm a high school senior this year and, contrary to all my sophomore year hopes, I have yet to figure out what I want to major in.\n\nOn the one hand, I'm very, very bright. I have excellent test scores, varied interests, and 'A' grades in subjects across the board. Whatever colleges I end up getting into, they're sure to be good. As a result of this, along with my femaleness, I have for a long time felt pressure to go into a STEM field. After years of insisting it wasn't for me, I finally conceded, and decided I would go for astrophysics. I like math, I like having the right answer, and I have a philosophical interest in the subject (after all, \"there's a big, big universe out there, and we are but ants\"). Unfortunately, I have recently realized that might be about as far as it goes. Labs are a bore, I hate the laboratory environment, and, when it comes down to doing actual physics, I can think of a great many things I would rather be doing.\n\nOn the other hand, we have... those things I'd rather be doing. I love literature, and history, and philosophy, and all those things that are generally considered by society to be \"useless.\" If I could have my way, I would be an academic, or a writer, or an editor (but, yes, mostly an academic), and would (in my estimation) be perfectly happy, despite the small salary. If I do this, though, it would be seen as \"wasting my potential.\" The way those around me see it (HS counselors and the like), I have a duty to society to do what is in the interest of that society, and being a philosophy major just isn't going to cut it.\n\nOn yet another hand (which we will assume I have three of, since that would be sort of cool), I have a sort of a middle ground. Whenever I take tests on this sort of thing (\"what's your major,\" etc.), I always end up with political science-type majors, and especially things like international relations and foreign languages. I do love languages (I've worked hard to keep French on my schedule every term, at the expense of other opportunities at the university where I have attended class for the past two years), and I do have sort of a vague notion that I might like to work with an NGO or even (*legasp*) the United Nations, but I'm not sure if I'd actually enjoy the coursework for such a thing. While I love travel and would like the chance to bang some politicians' heads together at the international level, I'm not sure if I even /like/ polisci. I hated economics, and, while I enjoy debating my own, highly idealistic brand of politics, I'm not sure I'd enjoy dealing with politics as it applies to the real world. (Aside from which, I have difficulty imagining myself fulfilled with a real /job/ like my parents and the rest of boring old America, as ridiculous as that sounds.)\n\nThe majority of the colleges I'm applying to are actually in the UK (I wasn't motivated about college until I decided I wanted to study abroad, so it's sort of non-negotiable), and require me to choose a course of study when I apply, so I have to figure this out within the next few months. So what should I go for? The STEM field that would always offer a challenge, but which I have no real passion for? The liberal arts degree I have all the passion in the world for, but would be seen as wasting my talents? Or the IR path that could be a potential source of either unparalleled excitement, or absolute misery?\n\nAny and all opinions are appreciated.

Do your worst!\n\nColleges:\nStanford\nBerkeley\nCornell\nCarnegie Mellon\nUniversity of Chicago\nUniversity of Pennsylvania\nColumbia University\nPrinceton\nHarvard (Doubt I'll get in, but parents want me to apply here anyways)\n\nAbout me:\nMale\nAsian\nUpper Middle Class (Gross household income is ~150-175k,)\nPublic School\n\nSAT: 2330 (M: 800 CR: 800 W: 730) - Only took it once, this October.\nNMST: 222 (M: 80 CR: 73 W: 69)\nSAT II tests: Math II: 800 Chemistry: 800\nACT: 33 (Without writing, was a mandatory that we all had to take as Juniors)\n\nGPA: 4.00 Unweighted, 4.8~ Weighted\nClass Rank: 2/770 (I might be valedictorian next semester though)\nCourse Load: Nothing too rigorous, I guess the important classes are:\nCalculus BC and Chemistry\n\nAP Scores are all 5s for the following subjects (8/8):\nHuman Geography\nComparative Government and Politics\nCalculus AB\nCalculus BC\nChemistry\nEnglish Language & Composition\nUnited States History\nPsychology\n\nSenior Courseload is pretty unremarkable, since I kind of ran out of classes to take at my school, they're all weighted courses though.\nRelevant is probably AP Physics B. I'm probably taking 7 AP tests at the end of this year.\n\nECs:\nAnd here's the problem, as indicated by the title, I haven't really done much outside of school, especially in regards to volunteering.\n\nTutoring (30~ Hours) - I've done a bit of all different types of tutoring, for pay, personal tutoring and math lab (just tutoring after school in classrooms).\n\nNHS, SHS (Spanish Honor Society), Science Club, Math Club (~25 hours) - Haven't really done anything major in any of these.\n\nThere have been some other clubs that I've been in or briefly been in, like MUN and Speech and Debate, but I would feel guilty if I actually put those on my application. I don't want to get into a lengthy explanation, because I know it's partially my fault for not being more involved, but I genuinely felt like I was participating in the clubs for the wrong reason (The sole interest of trying to make my college application look better, I wasn't actually interested).\n\nAs far as what I'd call \"Standard ECs\" I've pretty much done the bare minimum required to stay in the organization.\n\nThis is where it gets a little weird (still ECs):\nVideo Game - League of Legends (~1000 Hours)\n\nNot to digress too much, but it's basically a more user-friendly, less-skill based, and more macro-management oriented version of Defense of the Ancients (DoTA). I've been encouraged by many people to talk about this, because it has constituted a significant part of my out-of school life and I do feel like I can talk passionately about this. I legitimately believe I learned a lot about communication and teamwork from playing this game; one of the best skills I've taken away from it is how to keep my cool despite the situation (online disinhibition effect + hormonal teenagers/young adults can get pretty nasty sometimes) and stay focused on greater objectives. Also, the game is a solid example of how paper does not always translate into results; itemization builds which are theoretically the most optimal turn out to be inefficient due to many other variables.\n\nThere is a lot of strategy and theory-crafting that goes along with this game, especially when you have a large group of friends that play the game with you. I feel like this has helped make up for some of the deficiencies I've had at school, and at times I do feel challenged on an intellectual level; I learn new things almost every game I play. The game forces you to think on your feet, which is something that rarely happens at school.\n\nAs for actual awards: I was ranked Bronze elo season 1 (Top 25% of players), and Gold elo season 2 (Top 10% of players). I'm by no means great at the game, but I am slightly above average.\n\nOther ECs - Weightlifting (~400 Hours)\n\nAgain, a personal EC. I don't want to talk too extensively about this one, but it has taught me to be a lot more appreciative of athletes in general. I'll admit I had pretty negative conceptions of athletes before I started lifting, but a lot of that has changed. I feel it was really important for me to do something I'm extremely bad at, because it removed a lot of my pretentiousness in general. For the amount of time I've put into this activity, I'm still hilariously weak, but I'm proud of the progress I've made. Weightlifting also taught me A LOT about setting goals and pushing myself, because grades have always come naturally to me (not trying to sound cocky, but this is a fact >_<).\nI didn't compete or anything for this.\n\nSchool Awards:\nMy school doesn't give out awards :(.\n\nRecommendations:\n1) Calculus BC Teacher - Is going to be awesome!\n2) Chemistry Teacher (both for honors and AP) - Is also going to be awesome! They both know me really well and are super smart.\n3) Counselor Recommendation - Ok-ish. I don't really visit my counselor on a regular basis, so I haven't really ever talked to her until this year. She said she kind of had trouble getting a full picture of who I was as a person and how to market me to colleges. I will admit I tend to be pretty mechanically functional in real life (I'm also a lot more terse).\n\nAdditional Info:\nMy sister went to Stanford, so I guess that counts as a sort of weak legacy.\nI'm planning on majoring in Statistics, with an eventual career of Actuary or Statistician.\n\nA little bit about my general approach:\nI'm mainly going to write about how my ECs are a lot different from the conventional competitive student, and hopefully how I can bring something different to the table than simply the class president or varsity sports team leader. Two themes I'm going to emphasize are:\n\nLearning without the intention of learning - For example, the only reason I ended up doing so well on the CR portion of the SATs was because I knew what erudite meant from playing Kingdom of Loathing, an online video game. This isn't a single example, there's been a lot of opportunities where I've been able to apply random things I did/read to academics with great success. I have virtually no academic ECs and I rarely read books or do anything that would make me a more 'learned' person. I believe that every experience is important, you just need to understand how to apply them to other contexts.\n\nIndependence and integrity - I did what I wanted to do, not what would get me into colleges. NO REGRETS! :)\n\nAnyways, if you're still reading this, please leave a comment. Thank you if you read every word of this post, I appreciate it! :) "}, {"date": "2012-12-14T19:11:39+00:00", "url": "http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/harvard-university/1430127-deferred-due-to-paperwork.html", "messages": "\n                    Hi there! This is my first time posting on CC!\n\nSo I was one of many Harvard deferrals yesterday. However, when I called the admissions office today, I was told that they never really had my SAT Subject Test scores (even though I sent in an additional score report the moment I received the results in November, and have the receipt to prove it from collegeboard).\n\nI was then told by the lady that I actually have two separate accounts (???) and that my subject test scores were in the other one. She merged them into one account this morning, after decisions were out. She actually told me that this might well have been the reason I was deferred: that the admissions team didn't have the scores and wanted to wait until I could take them. Except I already did.\n\nIs this something that happens normally? I'm a Canadian student, so I don't know that much about the common app and how they are received by colleges. However, I still feel this is unfair, because it wasn't my fault those scores weren't placed in my main account. The worst thing is, my guidance counselor actually phoned in two weeks ago and another lady told him they had received everything that was required!\n\nSo my question is, what course of action should I take? Of course, phoning the admissions office and asking? Contacting my admissions officer directly and explain the situation to him? (I have no idea who he is, but it's easy to find out).

And I've sneaked my way onto the internet now to ask you guys how I might salvage this situation and end up somewhere decent this fall.

I started learning how to code Objective-C for fun and soon enough, I created an app! I wanted to submit it to the App Store, but my parents didn't have money. So I decided to work as a waiter at my parent's small business in exchange for a $100 developer license to submit apps to Apple. After I created my account and everything, I submitted my app. (All of this happened in the beginning of 8th grade, I was 13) About a week went by and I got an email from Apple that my app was approved to be in the store. My parents didn't know much about what was going on, but they were happy to see me happy. I didn't know how to read sales the first day so I didn't know how much money I made. Since my app was $0.99, and in the records I thought I made 2 dollars, I'm not sure why. Well I was happy until I checked again and noticed that the \"unit\" number meant the total number of sales for that app. I recalculated and I had actually made $48 on my first day! It was crazy what I had accomplished and I was feeling happy thinking that beginner's luck had struck me. Well, the next day I woke up to check out my competition in my app's category in the store. i was stupid and innocent to think that maybe Google app or the Wikipedia app or the NatGeo app would be competition to me and my little app, but when I scrolled down to number 7 in the top charts, I noticed my name right there! My app had reached the top 7! I ran upstairs to my parents room and woke them up extremely happy, but they didn't really instant the meaning of it, and I'm sure I didn't either. I had made $210 that day so that was a shocker and the next day was $270 and it just kept growing! Until by the end of 8th grade, I was making hundreds of dollars a day. But I wasn't sure what to do with the money, I was only 13! I started high school, but I didn't start like all my friends. I was now running a business. I started getting interviews from many TV stations such as CNN International, NBC, Univision, Telemundo, and a bunch of others. Then people from all over the world began to contact me asking for business deals and I was in complete shock. I had been with about a year of experience in the \"app world\" and I was already a hit! Many owners of companies started to seriously want me to travel to their countries and have meetings over potential ideas. Soon enough, they wanted me to speak at professional universities in different countries! Since I was Hispanic, countries in South America also wanted me to visit and I was only in the 9th grade by then, just starting high school. I learned the ways of television and I began to strategize my interviews on different programs. And then when it came to me holding conferences at top universities internationally, I was once again baffled. I had to speak I front of about 2500 college students and what I was I going to say?! Well I just did what I knew best how to do and slowly I learned public speaking through that. Having a great opportunity if meeting many students from colleges after they heard me speak, I began to have lots of followers and admirers on Facebook and Twitter! It was something amazing and shocking at the same time! Me, a prodigy? What?! No... So that's how my life started for the beginning or entering high school and the interviews and conferences grew every year and became more prominent. Just last year, in junior year I landed a deal with the government of Peru to make their official tourism app and it is launching next month. They have posters ready and printing for their airports and everything. On the other hand, I'm traveling to Uruguay in the summer to speak at a conference in which and executive from Google will also be speaking alongside me.\n\nWell everything seems to go great, but then everything changed halfway through the ninth grade. When the economy hit a new low for my parents, they had not saved any money. My parents had two small restaurants and had to give away one of them, losing everything with it due to the amounts of debt we had. Soon after, my mom told us that we were going to be evicted from our house and my life began to take a turn. I started bringing in lots of money from my business, but my parents had this horrible situation. So what started to happen? My money began being used up by debt. My parents had to maintain the small business because they never went to college and finding a job would be impossible. Calculating the actual income of the restaurant, I turned out to be about negative $4000 a month. And there was nothing I could do, except loan my money. Soon enough we reached a point where we had to find a place to move, and we found a small apartment to live in while I was working with my apps, I managed to earn enough money to pay for that apartment. And then my parents told me that I will have to be taken out of my school in junior year because there wasn't enough money coming in from their small business. So I took things into my own hands and became the father of the family, at the age of 15. I began paying my school and my sister's school. I started paying the rent for the apartment and the small business. Paying all the employees my mom hired and anything else you could imagine. It was great helping out my parents, but I was running out of energy and I just couldn't handle the pressure of maintaining a family at such a young age, which I still do today. Like anyone in the App Store knows, you have to keep making new apps if you want to continue making money, and I hadn't made new apps in a while because of the difficulty of making apps and studying for school! I was in the 11th grade when my counselor pulled me in and asked me, \"What's going on with you? Your grades have plummeted. They aren't what they used to be. Your chances of getting into better schools is going away. Is anything wrong?\" That's when it hit me. I couldn't hold it in any longer. I had to tell my counselor what was going on, so I did and he said that don't worry, we'll fix this, but you need to calm down. I was starting to go to my counselor every week to see what I could do. He suggested to become an emancipated minor, but he knew that the stress from the courts and everything would be worse for me at the moment, so we just kept pulling through. I never liked to talk to anyone or my teachers or ask for favors. And I had to go up to each of them explaining the situation and telling them what was going on. I felt horrible having to ask them for help, but that was the situation. My GPA at the time had fallen to 3.75 (weighted) by the end of the 10th grade and in junior year I was trying my best to bring it up. Now I'm finishing junior year and my GPA (cumulative) is looking like it could reach a 3.89 (weighted). I feel like I could have done more, seeing my Facebook with messages everyday from students all over the world saying how much they admire me and that I'm a genius and what not, but they didn't know what was going on in the inside. I took the ACT and SAT and I didn't think I would do any good either, but my college counselor told me that these tests were made to show your true intelligence. She said you didn't have to study for these. I was extremely relieved at the time because I was working with the government of Peru on the app that was to come out this March. When I went to take the exam, I didn't find it to be very difficult. Instead, I actually thought I did well. When my results came in, I had gotten a 31 on my ACT and a 1290/1600 on my SAT.

I started learning how to code Objective-C for fun and soon enough, I created an app! I wanted to submit it to the App Store, but my parents didn't have money. So I decided to work as a waiter at my parent's small business in exchange for a $100 developer license to submit apps to Apple. After I created my account and everything, I submitted my app. (All of this happened in the beginning of 8th grade, I was 13) About a week went by and I got an email from Apple that my app was approved to be in the store. My parents didn't know much about what was going on, but they were happy to see me happy. I didn't know how to read sales the first day so I didn't know how much money I made. Since my app was $0.99, and in the records I thought I made 2 dollars, I'm not sure why. Well I was happy until I checked again and noticed that the \"unit\" number meant the total number of sales for that app. I recalculated and I had actually made $48 on my first day! It was crazy what I had accomplished and I was feeling happy thinking that beginner's luck had struck me. Well, the next day I woke up to check out my competition in my app's category in the store. i was stupid and innocent to think that maybe Google app or the Wikipedia app or the NatGeo app would be competition to me and my little app, but when I scrolled down to number 7 in the top charts, I noticed my name right there! My app had reached the top 7! I ran upstairs to my parents room and woke them up extremely happy, but they didn't really instant the meaning of it, and I'm sure I didn't either. I had made $210 that day so that was a shocker and the next day was $270 and it just kept growing! Until by the end of 8th grade, I was making hundreds of dollars a day. But I wasn't sure what to do with the money, I was only 13! I started high school, but I didn't start like all my friends. I was now running a business. I started getting interviews from many TV stations such as CNN International, NBC, Univision, Telemundo, and a bunch of others. Then people from all over the world began to contact me asking for business deals and I was in complete shock. I had been with about a year of experience in the \"app world\" and I was already a hit! Many owners of companies started to seriously want me to travel to their countries and have meetings over potential ideas. Soon enough, they wanted me to speak at professional universities in different countries! Since I was Hispanic, countries in South America also wanted me to visit and I was only in the 9th grade by then, just starting high school. I learned the ways of television and I began to strategize my interviews on different programs. And then when it came to me holding conferences at top universities internationally, I was once again baffled. I had to speak I front of about 2500 college students and what I was I going to say?! Well I just did what I knew best how to do and slowly I learned public speaking through that. Having a great opportunity if meeting many students from colleges after they heard me speak, I began to have lots of followers and admirers on Facebook and Twitter! It was something amazing and shocking at the same time! Me, a prodigy? What?! No... So that's how my life started for the beginning or entering high school and the interviews and conferences grew every year and became more prominent. Just last year, in junior year I landed a deal with the government of Peru to make their official tourism app and it is launching next month. They have posters ready and printing for their airports and everything. On the other hand, I'm traveling to Uruguay in the summer to speak at a conference in which and executive from Google will also be speaking alongside me.\n\nWell everything seems to go great, but then everything changed halfway through the ninth grade. When the economy hit a new low for my parents, they had not saved any money. My parents had two small restaurants and had to give away one of them, losing everything with it due to the amounts of debt we had. Soon after, my mom told us that we were going to be evicted from our house and my life began to take a turn. I started bringing in lots of money from my business, but my parents had this horrible situation. So what started to happen? My money began being used up by debt. My parents had to maintain the small business because they never went to college and finding a job would be impossible. Calculating the actual income of the restaurant, I turned out to be about negative $4000 a month. And there was nothing I could do, except loan my money. Soon enough we reached a point where we had to find a place to move, and we found a small apartment to live in while I was working with my apps, I managed to earn enough money to pay for that apartment. And then my parents told me that I will have to be taken out of my school in junior year because there wasn't enough money coming in from their small business. So I took things into my own hands and became the father of the family, at the age of 15. I began paying my school and my sister's school. I started paying the rent for the apartment and the small business. Paying all the employees my mom hired and anything else you could imagine. It was great helping out my parents, but I was running out of energy and I just couldn't handle the pressure of maintaining a family at such a young age, which I still do today. Like anyone in the App Store knows, you have to keep making new apps if you want to continue making money, and I hadn't made new apps in a while because of the difficulty of making apps and studying for school! I was in the 11th grade when my counselor pulled me in and asked me, \"What's going on with you? Your grades have plummeted. They aren't what they used to be. Your chances of getting into better schools is going away. Is anything wrong?\" That's when it hit me. I couldn't hold it in any longer. I had to tell my counselor what was going on, so I did and he said that don't worry, we'll fix this, but you need to calm down. I was starting to go to my counselor every week to see what I could do. He suggested to become an emancipated minor, but he knew that the stress from the courts and everything would be worse for me at the moment, so we just kept pulling through. I never liked to talk to anyone or my teachers or ask for favors. And I had to go up to each of them explaining the situation and telling them what was going on. I felt horrible having to ask them for help, but that was the situation. My GPA at the time had fallen to 3.75 (weighted) by the end of the 10th grade and in junior year I was trying my best to bring it up. Now I'm finishing junior year and my GPA (cumulative) is looking like it could reach a 3.89 (weighted). I feel like I could have done more, seeing my Facebook with messages everyday from students all over the world saying how much they admire me and that I'm a genius and what not, but they didn't know what was going on in the inside. I took the ACT and SAT and I didn't think I would do any good either, but my college counselor told me that these tests were made to show your true intelligence. She said you didn't have to study for these. I was extremely relieved at the time because I was working with the government of Peru on the app that was to come out this March. When I went to take the exam, I didn't find it to be very difficult. Instead, I actually thought I did well. When my results came in, I had gotten a 31 on my ACT and a 1290/1600 on my SAT. My counselor said that was really good. So I was proud of myself, but I still felt like it wasn't going to be enough. I am now ready to apply to my colleges, but I don't know what to do. My dream is and always will be Stanford, but I'm not sure if it could happen now that my GPA doesn't represent me.

Enrolling in my local community college was more difficult than figuring out what I needed for my major and whether IGETC was worthwhile (assist.org), info I had to find and understand myself because of budget cuts to counseling at my CC. You will not be spoonfed at UC, either. Empower yourself now and it will reflect in not only your GPA, but your statement, your writing, your attitude......\n\n\u0095 Is getting a D/F going to hurt my chances of ... ?\nIf you need someone to answer this question:\na) you have a lot of growing up to do\nb) you're probably not going to make it at UC anyhow -- this is geared towards those not who had circumstances which resulted in a loss of personal resources sufficient to doing well, but those on here whose posts are laced with allusions to ennui or laziness.\n\n\u0095 Chancing...\n\nWhat. A. Waste. Of. Time.\nInstead of agonizing about chancing, why don't you go study, or proofread a paper, and improve your chances by improving your skills and thereby improving your GPA. Yes, a 3.9 is significantly better than a 3.75, so go earn one instead of hoping to slide through.\n\nAnd this chide is based on the fact that many posters on here, often the ones begging for chancing, display an atrocious use of English \u0097 even if this is an internet forum \u0097 which could be greatly improved by spending your time reading, again, instead of hoping.\n\nSo, if you're reading this, and thinking about applying, here's some free, rant-laden advice to those future UC applicants I hope to see on campus two years from now. Buck up, wo/man up, focus your questions towards classmates about classwork, try not to sweat the admissions process (tough, I know,) and do the footwork yourself if you actually want success.

I know my first post is a request for help, which is not so good, but I am preparing for SAT in an incredible short time without any prior knowledge of the examinations so I only have time stalk on threads in the forum for tips and all.\n\nI'm having my test on November 2nd and I must say my most feared part is the essay. I still have a lot of troubles with coming up with examples. This is the first complete essay I have actually written in allotted time and I really need some feed-backs from you. The prompt is\n\n\"Is the way something seems to be not always the same as it actually is?\"\n\nand here is my essay.\n\nEveryone grows up in different environments which differ their perspectives. As a result, the public's view is not always the absolute answer - sometimes the truth can be the opposite of what people always expect. Many movies and novels have depicted this paradox of life, two of which are the movie The Shawshank Redemption and the novel Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen.\n\nIn The Shawshank Redemption, the protagonist is a \"hotshot banker\" named Andy Dufresne, who is charged of murder. He was believed to have killed his wife and her lover intentionally for revenge. However, along the years of Andy's imprisonment, it was revealed that the real butcher was another unruly man, who would kill just anyone that \"do **** to him\". Andy found out the truth when he was in his twentieth year of his life sentence.\n\nWe can't really blame the judge or the lawyer because the truth is all the proofs did go against him. They had his fingerprints everywhere, on the broken wine bottle, on the gun and his footprints were found on the muddy road. Even his neighbors testified that he cursed his wife to hell. Anyone with a rational mind would not hesitate to accuse him of murder. However, he was not one. Sometimes, things are not the same as they look like.\n\nThis notion is not new. In fact, it went back to 18th century when a young woman named Jane Austen devoted a whole novel to write about the prejudiced human beings. Mr Darcy in Pride and Prejudice initially came of as an arrogant and self-centered man. He seemed to despise everything he deemed not worthy of his rank: Lizzy was not \"handsome enough\" to dance with him and her family was just a bunch of snobs who just had their eyes on possession. While he in fact did make these remarks, they did not reflect his true personality. He was, actually, a kind brother, a dear friend and a passionate man. There is a saying that says if you want to know a man, see how he treats his inferiors. The servant who took Lizzy and Mr and Mrs Gardiner on a tour around Pemberley complimented Mr Darcy with sincere. Those are probably the first favored descriptions of this man, who seemed like the worst human being in the world, but they are the truest nonetheless.\n\nFacts are facts but facts might not be the true. It's always hard to make a judgement, especially regarding people. Human beings are complicated and the cover usually does not reveal it all.

His eyes examine the cozy classroom. He has acquired a mouth to speak with, but has not yet acquired the language. He is free from authority, but is not yet free from his own consciousness.  The drawings flow from the pencil in his hand. His ears concentrated toward the locution of the teacher, but he hears nothing meaningful. Isolation has always been with him in this classroom; he is left a speechless alien. He notices no loneliness. He notices no bareness. Life in the classroom has always been like this. An ambiguous irony, an unnecessary paradox stalked through his life, leaving him as a victim of the unrevealed future. As the words from his teacher slowly doze out, his conscious comes back to the classroom, back to the place of learning\u0085\nNo five hundred pages of tightly written novel can even superficially outline my life. No one-thousand paged novel can either. My life has been a struggle, it has been a victory. It has been a failure, it has been a success. Since the moment when I walked through the gate of the Portland Airport, a new future greeted me with its devious smile. Separated callously away from my friends, left here in this foreign land, my quiet innocent soul was alarmed by the forewarning of obscurity. My tongue was thirsty for communication. Every time, everywhere, all I was surrounded by the strange language which I have did not know. School, market, neighbors, clubs, everywhere, strange people, strange words haunted me. Fearing human contact, I could not even bring myself to look into the faces of people who spoke to me. So this was it. This was my life. Living as an outcast to the world, living as a prisoner of my own fear. I lost my confidence and zeal.\nJanuary 31, 1996. Snow, storm, hail, rain, ice. The icy chills covered the town. Broken trees, collapsed houses everywhere, and one person lying on the bed, coughing and coughing, unable to resist the might of the sickness, tortured by the undefeatable coldness. This was the day that would change my life and awaken me from my own world. My grandpa, who amused and worried about me, who always stood strong like colossus, helplessly craving for life which will vanish into thin air. That moment, I realized. This was the fate of my grandpa. This was the fate of a person who was left in an unknown place friendless and speechless. From that time on, only one word came into my mind: Learn. It was time to let myself out into the foreign land and face the challenge, and defeat it.\nLearning. I cannot say I\u0092ve been successful. In fact, maybe I\u0092ve been a failure. But I\u0092ve come to realize that life cannot be overlooked on for mere fear. For three years, I\u0092ve always carried a dictionary along with me. Three years of intense hunting for new words, thirsty for the defeat of the language barrier that has been the main obstacle blocking me from the society. Three years of intensely catching up with the rest of the students. Worn out dictionary as the result of my \u0093hunting,\u0094 as I entered the Jr. High school, I was finally able to extricate the dictionary from me. As more social opportunities welcomed me, I begin to harmonize my soul with the world through cello I have started.\nBy the time I reached 11th grade, I had moved five times since I walked through the gate of Portland. I was so thirsty for the words \u0093Honors\u0094 and \u0093Advanced,\u0094 realizing the value of success. Try to go ahead. Don\u0092t just try to catch up with everyone. Work more, Go more. Although the result has not been satisfying enough for my desire, I have successfully gone beyond my imagination of my life. Who would have known? Ten years ago, I was just a little boy who sat way back in the room holding a pencil drawing pictures, always a dictionary by my side. Now, I am walking the same path every ordinary American student is walking, not at all falling behind. All because of the one concept in my mind: Learn.\n\n-the end-  <--- not part of my essay\n\n(I want as many of negative comment as possible so i know exactly what i need to fix) Thank you                "}, {"date": "2004-12-10T02:25:03+00:00", "url": "http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/yale-university/15143-yale-people-listen-up.html", "messages": "\n                    In a few days you all going to be going online to find out your EA results, and unfortunately for most of you the news won't be good.  If the news is good, my warmest congratulations on a job well done.  But if the news is disappointing, well, go ahead and mourn for a day, maybe two at the most.   But after that it's time to think about the future.  And what I'm really here to tell you is that in spite of what you will be feeling at that point, the future is actually VERY bright.\n\nYou see last year at this time my daughter was in your shoes.  In spite of excellent stats and other qualifications, she was REJECTED outright by Yale in the EA round.  She didn't cry.  She didn't say much of anything.  She just stared and the screen for a few minutes and then silently got up and went back to her calculus homework.  And at that moment she also became convinced that she wasn't going to get into any colleges at all.\n\nBut of course that turned out not to be the case.  Fast forward to the RD round in April and Yale turns out to have been the only school to reject her outright.  What had been worry over getting into any school turned into worry over which wonderful school to attend.  What a difference a few months makes.  She was accepted by Harvard, MIT, Stanford, Berkeley, Wellesley, Pomona, and a bunch of UC safeties.

For EA, Yale announced that the letters would be mailed on December 15 and decisions would be available online on the 16th.  In fact, however, the decisions were posted (through a link that suddenly appeared at  www.yale.edu/admit ) late in the afternoon on the 15th--I believe between 5 and 6 pm EST.  I think we knew to check the site then because they had done the same thing the previous year--posted the results a day earlier than promised.  Anyway, if you want to check your decision online, make sure you use your PIN number (which was sent to you in the mail) to activate your account and set up a password in advance, and that you have your username and password handy.\n\nWhen my daughter was deferred on December 15, the link took her directly to a pretty blunt letter (similar to the one on this year's Columbia site).  On April 1, when she was accepted RD, I believe the link was  supposed  to take her to a page with the Yale bulldog and the fight song and the words \"Welcome to Yale College Class of 2008,\" which would then take her to the acceptance letter, with \"Congratulations!\" right at the top.\n\nFor some reason, that's not what actually came up first in my daughter's case:  The link opened to a supplemental page with contact names for people in her areas of interest, and it was only because she saw the words \"Class of 2008\" somewhere in a corner that she started to wonder if maybe she'd been accepted after all.  (Unfortunately, the sound was muted on our computer, so I don't know if the fight song was playing.)  Eventually she followed links that took her to the bulldog and the letter.  Yale's computer people have probably fixed all the glitches by now--but just in case, if the answer isn't totally obvious right away, keep clicking through any links you find.\n\nAgain, the very best of luck to all of you; and please try to remember that things  do have a way of working out.

Im actualy not worried about maths in any way.  What really makes me panicking is the physics exam.\n\nI knew that I still hadnt studied all the stuff at school so i bought the kaplan preparation book. I studied for a whole week and then did the practice tests. In the first one i got 770 and in the second one i got 780. When i went for the exam however I found the questions harder that those in the prep book (and i guess the lack of practice made me feel as if the last time I studied physics was a month ago). Soo i got that amazing result. I've never been a physics genius but i know I can reach the 800 (and im utterly sure I can do better than that bloody 670).\n\nCan u plz give me any suggestions for a good practice book (physics only)? Does the kaplan actually cover all the stuff I need to know or i need a new book + practice?

But I've gotten questions in a few places (and private messages) about how our process works -- the role of faculty, students, etc. -- and thought I could at least note the more unique aspects here. Essentially all of this has been posted before on this board in separate places, but putting it all in one place is probably helpful.\n\nBasically, the unique thing at Caltech is the very high level of involvement of senior faculty and students in the reading process. The majority of schools relegate the admissions process completely to an office that exists just for the purpose of admissions. Caltech has a committee of faculty and students giving input on every aspect of the process, from broad policy questions (affirmative action or not, more girls or not, etc.) to the actual reading of applications and voting on them. The group of students is chosen by a branch of the Student Government.\n\nEssentially every application gets three reads -- one from a professional admisions officer, one from a professor, and one from a student. Each of the three people sees the full application and, like at other schools, every reader writes about a half-page summary noting the nuances of your case, pros and cons, etc., along with a \"vote\" of whether to admit/(defer if early)/waitlist/deny. If everyone agrees, the director usually checks over and confirms the decision. Any case where there is disagreement goes to a committee that is usually about 5 or 6 people in size, typically 2 admissions officers, 2 faculty, 2 students. There cases are discussed in detail and voted on.\n\nAs far as logistics go, we read applications over a period of about two months (for the regular round). Committee meetings take place over several days at the end of the reading period.\n\nIn general, I think this process results in extremely good decisions. I am very proud of the fact that we have active members of the academic community involved in choosing the next entering class. That keeps the process grounded and connected to the larger purpose of the Insitute. It also helps applicants, since you have a chance to appeal to three different audiences who will be able to appreciate different parts of your application. For instance, \"nerdy\" and sceintific boxes (essay III) that might not be completely appreciated by a professional educator (which is usually what the admissions officers are) will often produce a good comment from a prof or a student. At the same time, the latter two groups know from firsthand experience what it takes to make it at Caltech. We're willing to take risks when we see real talent despite problems, and I think we are often good at detecting the presence of absence of passion for science/math/engineering. I'm not saying the admissions people (who are really wonderful, dedicated people) are bad at any of these things -- in fact they are quite good -- but it does help to have the scientific perspective in there, since it often takes one to know one.\n\nAs for my posting on this board, the policy is that I separate my role as a student member of the committee this year from my work here answering questions. That doesn't mean I'm not allowed to explain nuances of admissions that are helpful to you and which I understand better as a result of my work; however, as applicants, your contact regarding your application should be the admissions officer assigned to your region, who are listed at http://admissions.caltech.edu/contact/staff. This is because it helps them to make a record of contacts with you (which can often be quite helpful to you). Secondly, they are the ones who will certainly be involved with YOUR application, and will be able to look at it as they talk to you. Any particular student or faculty member will probably not have read a given application -- and will probbaly have forgotten the details of many of the ones we read, since there will have been so many by the end.\n\nIn any case, it's a pleasure to answer your questions and hopefully make the stressful process of applying a little less scary and more transparent.

Before meeting Ronald Hall, motivation and maturity of life was clearly non-existent. At first sight he did not appear to be the typical sixty seven year old man, instead he appeared to be well-built and had a pulsating personality about him.\n\nHe asked me about my life ambition. My expectations were high; but I was unwilling to disclose them to him. But after speaking to him for some time, I came to the conclusion that he wanted to impart his knowledge to me. Then he quoted \u0093You are a brilliant boy.\u0094 I found it ironic that I would be disheartened by family and friends then supported by a stranger; it didn\u0092t make much sense to me. Then he quoted \u0093In faith there is enough light for those who want to believe and enough shadows to blind those who don't.\u0094 I was confused at first by what he meant but I came to the realization that light illuminates darkness, the sight of the ones who listens to constructive advice; if they are followed and applied it will eventually lead to actualization of their life dream and ambitions. While failure and agony awaits those who refuses to adhere to instruction, as a result they will fall into perpetual darkness full of sorrow and regrets.\n\nConsequently, after the conversation was over, I asked myself what would be the result of my life history; I was convinced he was a god-send. Ronald Hall is a man full of momentum that has brought me to the limelight of success because of his instruction. He encourage me to discover my potential, it is for these reasons I revere Ronald Hall and claim him to be the most influential person in my life.

It is the opium of the people.\" Karl Marx - Critique of Hegel's Philosophy of Right\n\nExtrapolating from November's voting results, I conclude that half the country disapprove of \"Sex and the City,\" \"Six Feet Under\" or the other HBO programs whose scripts include sex as routinely as they do eating or, in the case of \"The Sopranos,\" killing.\n\nPrograms that entertain millions also violate taboos conjured up by super Christian, Jewish and Moslem fundamentalists. Do diametrically opposite morality tracks run through the country? Do both of the tracks scream: \"follow the money?\" TV makes fortunes from sex shows. The sexual sentries also cash in, those who personify modern Puritanism, people H. L. Mencken described as possessed by \"the haunting fear that someone somewhere may be happy.\" Unlike the \"Sex in the City\" producers, the advocates of \"No Sex in the Country\" get federal money.\n\nThe Bush Administration allocated $168 million for 2005 to fund abstinence-only programs. Bush himself told a pious audience of \"no sex before marriage proselytizers that \"Through your educational programs, you reach out to countless young people to give them the support they need to make that responsible choice.\"\n\nDo as I say, the president in effect told the pious, not as I did for decades when I gallivanted with women and used intoxicating substances. When California Democratic Rep. Henry Waxman evaluated the abstinence-only curriculum that circulates in some public and many religious schools he found that adolescents learn that just by touching genitals pregnancy can result and you can catch the HIV virus through sweat and tears. Waxman's report concludes that 80% of the \"factual\" information in the abstinence-only programs about reproductive health is false, misleading, or distorted. (Max Blumenthal (Dec 15 Alternet).\n\nAs we learned from Iraq, Administration ideologues don't care about facts when they fashion policy. So, an ignorant public serves them well. These new Puritans distract a section of the public from thinking about Bush's plans to privatize social security and continue to sacrifice lives and money in his foolish and egotistical wars.\n\nOn the December day that the number of US soldiers killed in Iraq topped 1300 and the Iraqi casualty soared beyond 100,000, tens of millions of Americans focused their attention on abstinence. Apparently less concerned by bloodshed in Iraq and Afghanistan than about teenagers \"getting it on,\" members of Concerned Women for America joined their counterparts in the Abstinence Clearinghouse and Focus on the Family to preach not safe sex, but no sex -- until marriage, and even then in a very limited way.\n\nThese modern guardians of chastity don't want the government meddling in sex education except to teach abstinence. The Administration funds such programs under the heading of faith-based initiatives not because they seriously reduce teen pregnancy and STDs, but because they depoliticize the population.\n\nBy targeting sexual freedom - not massive killing in wars -- as the most offensive element in US culture, fundamentalist preachers divert their flocks from thinking about reality. Fear and repression of sex, the twin engines of distraction, obfuscate or even justify killing large numbers of people for a dubious cause. Indeed, some TV preachers, golden cuff links and Rolexes shining in the klieg lights, beseech their flock to love the unborn and pray for those who are fighting the Lord's fight in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nThey warn that Satan placed on earth homosexuals and other \"perverts\" who wait to pounce on innocent youth and win their hearts and bodies.\n\nThis contemporary fear-mongering rings hollow in the context of 17th Century Puritans who had posited their mission as building a \"Zion in the Wilderness,\" a moral society fit for redemption and thus Christ's return. The new fundamentalists have diluted this theology. Their Kingdom of the Apocalypse, followed by Rapture for the chosen people, will occur only after the Armageddon War brings the world to an end. They have reduced 17th Century hairsplitting Puritan theology to slogans like \"God bless only America.\"\n\nPuritan theologians who landed in Massachusetts Bay in 1624 drafted rules of permissible behavior - morality. They understood that these restrictions ran directly counter to actual human instinct, i.e.; temptation to sin. But the Puritans came to the new world precisely because the old one had grown too corrupt for salvation. They foreswore drinking, dancing, sexual experimentation and even poetry that might suggest the above. Their dogmatic and dubious theology died in the 1690s, shortly after they burned several \"witches\" (devil's agents). But their legacy filtered down into today's simplistic political-sexual guidebook.\n\nContemporary bible thumpers, hardly scholars of Jonathan Edwards' discipline, maintain the old taboos and incorporate empire, and especially the Middle East, into their pseudo Godly mission. Pat Robertson even claims that God talks directly to him - a statement that would cause Cotton Mather to frown.\n\nLike their mission-bound ancestors, the 20th Century hard edged preachers defined smoking, drinking, dancing and sex as Devil's activities. Teenagers in the Bible Belt - even those about to go to war - still share the inherited wisdom: \"Don't do it standing up lest you be accused of dancing.\"\n\nTeenagers hide folded copies of Playboy and Hustler photos inside inspirational novels by Tim La Haye. But the Sodom and Gomorrah signs of cultural decay (widespread masturbation, homosexuality and non-married sex -- or thoughts of the above) have acquired neo-satanic tinges.\n\nIn case the non-ultra world tries to avoid dealing with the contemporary Puritans, movies like Kinsey bring out the contemporary sex haters. One Jewish extremist, Judith Reisman, attributes to Kinsey the basic moral decline that she associates with sexual promiscuity and cultural degeneracy. This ex-communist, Jewish woman, allied with the evangelical prudes who have even tried to limit the screening of the new movie, sees herself as a protector of morals. Her book, Kinsey: Crimes and Consequences, compares Kinsey to Nazi scientists and insinuates that his teenage involvement in the Boy Scouts was equivalent to membership in the Hitler Youth. Reisman called Dr. Alfred Kinsey a high priest of perversion, who opened the door for The Age of Pornography (See Blumenthal, Alternet Dec 15).\n\n56 years after the Harvard educated Indiana University professor published his Sexual Behavior in the Human Male, the Uptights continue to fight their \"moral war\" against the sexual facts. Indeed, they may have just won an election over sexual issues, disguised, of course, as moral values.\n\nKinsey, a zoologist who encountered widespread ignorance about sex and the dissemination of nonsense passing as sex education, decided to find out about human sexual behavior. Having studied wasps, Kinsey knew he had to go beyond observation to categorize American sexual mores. So, his team asked questions. The sample of those who confided in Kinsey interviewers revealed that a substantial sector used their genitals in \"taboo\" ways.\n\nFor example, more than half of the rural Indiana males that Kinsey interviewed confessed to \"doing it\" with animals; not just sheep and cows, but pigs as well. At least they weren't dropping their seed on a barren rock, a biblical taboo.\n\nKinsey also discovered that men - and later women as well - practiced a vast range of sexual behavior. Indeed, Americans behaved pretty much the way the rest of the world did from time immemorial.\n\nBut these facts did not deter the carriers of diluted Puritanism who still maintain that pleasure from sex is inherently wicked and that knowledge of it should remain restricted. And those shocked by sexual pleasure get money for advocating such positions Reisman, for example, recently lobbied the Senate for legislation that would force them to hold hearings about whether Kinsey and his team during their interviews sexually molested children. Federal funds would, of course, finance such \"research.\" Her previous research has served the straitlaced set - at least financially.\n\nThe Abstinence Clearinghouse already receives substantial federal money to promote its abstinence-only programs in public schools. The Department of Health and Human Services funds a variety of faith-based abstinence-only movements who spread their blather through public school curricula.\n\nReisman holds Kinsey, and Masters and Johnson who followed him as sex studiers, responsible for destroying traditional morality. Reisman referred to these \"scholars\" as homosexual proselytizers.\n\nThis line played well before former Rep. Steve Stockman and Kansas Republican Senator Sam Brownback who continues to try to slip funding for Resiman into legislation.\n\nWhat a divided nation! Over sex? HBO viewers shake their heads in disgust over the flap around Janet Jackson's exposed breast during last year's super bowl. But the prudes mobilized around that mammary issue and the FCC fined the offending network - and put a chilling effect on all the media.\n\nTo counter the pleasure haters who benefit financially from their odium, I offer words from the philosopher Woody Allen. \"Is sex dirty? Only if it's done right,\" he said.\n\nLandau directs digital media at Cal Poly Pomona University and is a fellow of the Institute for Policy Studies.

From consumer goods to medical technology, our developments are the key reason why we are the longest-living and most prosperous people in history.\n\nMass production and the assembly line have allowed many products to be within the purchase range of the average citizen. Before Henry Ford\u0092s concept of the assembly line, automobiles were too expensive to be practical for most people, and only the wealthy could enjoy the benefits of speedy travel. Then the assembly line changed everything, and all levels of society could easily buy a car. Some may argue that cars have been catastrophic to the environment, but without cars, people would not be able to have the kind of personal and economic (from being able to commute to work) freedom they enjoy in modern times.\n\nImproved techniques in food preservation, such as canning, have been a great boon for the average diet. Pasteurization made milk safe, an important thing since milk is crucial for a child\u0092s physical development. Canning also widened the variety of a person\u0092s diet, increasing the availability of vitamins and nutrients.\n\nModern medicine is one of today\u0092s greatest achievements, as the old days of superstition and quackery are gone. An MRI machine can take images of the brain in mere seconds, while a myriad of vaccines, from polio to smallpox, have mercifully depleted the number of cases of dangerous illnesses. X-ray machines can determine almost instantly where a fracture is and how serious it is. Because of the advances of modern medicine, people today enjoy longer lives than of their forefathers.\n\nAs humankind emerged from caves to form cities, technology and new developments have always been a great aid. While it has not been a spotless record, our present day prosperity is a testament to the benefit of change and convenience when they are done right. People today can buy the things they want, eat the foods they need, and receive the treatments they require. Though we naturally complain as all people are prone to do, we are truly blessed for the times we live in.\n\nEssay 2:\n\nTopic: Is conscience a more powerful motivator than money, fame, or power?\n\nDespite the ideals that humanity tries to uphold, we are more often moved by personal desires such as money or power, rather than conscience. This can be observed in two instances of history: slavery in America, and the rise of Joseph Stalin in the Soviet Union.\n\nWhile the most of the world had come around to condemn slavery, the U.S. still tried to justify it as a necessary evil to keep their economy going. Actually, that was the view of conciliatory Northern politicians; hardcore Southerners believed it was good for the blacks to be dominated by a few wealthy whites. They believed this despite the fact that the Declaration of Independence stated that all men were created equal. Why would Americans knowingly defy their most sacred document? Because the Southern states needed cheap (or free) labour to keep their agrarian economy going, and the Northern states needed to have the approval of the Southerners to win elections. So a double conspiracy worked against the black slaves; it was perpetrated by the Southerners, and largely tolerated, and even abetted, by the Northerners. Slavery was kept alive for economic necessity of the South and for political benefits in the North.\n\nUntil it turned into one man\u0092s insane quest for power, the Russian Revolution was supposed to be the great triumph of an egalitarian ideal overthrowing a neglectful and incompetent oligarchy. While the serfs were starving for bread, Tsar Nicholas II and his aides were clueless to their plight. When the revolution succeeded in 1917, the Russians expected a new start towards prosperity. However, with the death of Vladimir Lenin, a power struggle arose between Leon Trotsky and Joseph Stalin, the two powerhouse figures of the Bolsheviks. The latter won, and to insure his power, he engaged in a series of political purges, assassinations (such as Trotsky and Kirov), and the suppression of all dissent. Lost were the ideals of socialism and \u0093Land, Peace, and Bread\u0094. Over 20 million were killed under Stalin\u0092s reign, from executions to starvation. None of his deeds were done to better the welfare of the USSR, but to keep himself in power.\n\nAbraham Lincoln once referred to the \u0093Better angels of our nature\u0094, meaning the two ways a human being could act: good or evil. Unfortunately, as history shows us, those in power tend to lose contact with their conscience for other gains such as power or money. It happened in America, it happened in the USSR, and it has happened everywhere else in between. How to prevent such recurring nightmares remains the ever elusive question.\n\nEssay 3:\n\nTopic: Can success be disastrous?\n\nSuccess at any cost often leads to downfall. The lack of foresight and disregard for consequences are large contributors to this result. In fictional stories, the foremost example is of Macbeth, the ruthless Scottish thane who murders his way to the throne, only to be violently deposed himself. In real life, the French Revolution and the zealous tactics employed by Maximilien Robespierre, who also met a bloody end, serves as a sobering example.\n\nIn Shakespeare\u0092s Macbeth, the title character goes from a respectable noble to a despised tyrant upon his death. The reason for his lamentable turnaround is his ambition, which is sparked by a prophecy by the Weird Sisters. Together with his wife, Macbeth traverses down a path of murder that includes his king and benefactor, Duncan, and his best friend, Banquo. He even murders women and children in order to ensure his power, such as when he slaughters the family of Macduff (a potential threat). Finally, a dual alliance between the nobleman Macduff and rightful heir Malcolm overthrows Macbeth, who is killed as a traitor and a tyrant. Though he achieved his ascension to the throne, it brought him no happiness and caused him to die in infamy among the people.\n\nSimilar to the tale of Macbeth is the French Revolution in its Reign of Terror phase under Maximilien Robespierre. The revolution began as an idealistic and justifiable revolt against the excesses of the Bourbon royal family and King Louis XVI. Various accomplishments were achieved through relatively non-violent means, such as the establishment of a national assembly. However, after the royal family\u0092s failed escape to Varennes, public paranoia took hold, allowing a resolute young man named Robespierre to carry out actions that he believed would ensure the survival of the revolution. Through the Committee of Public Safety, political opponents (such as the Girondists and Dantonists), royalists, and suspected enemies were sent to the guillotine. Due to his efforts, the revolution, at least in his image, lived on. Yet his bloody actions turned many against him, and ultimately resulted in his own beheading. The excesses of the revolution ironically paved the way for the emperorship of Napoleon, which were contrary to Robespierre\u0092s dreams of a republic. For all his success in enforcing his view of the revolution, he, like Macbeth, died ignominiously.\n\nThe singularity of vision that accompanies a mad drive for success so often disregards the consequences of actions. By believing that the ends justify the means, ruthless actions are rationalized, such as in the case of Macbeth and Robespierre. Yet both accounts tell of a bloody and dark end for the two men, not one of eternal happiness. From this, we can perhaps learn that happiness is a state of mind, not an accomplish  ment.

In fact, both exams grossly overpredicted my future academic performance, so you could say I got a good shake from them.  As an applicant, I liked the brownie points from these exams.\n\nBut these exams have very little to do with high school, college, or graduate work.  I have yet to meet a person who majors in Standardized Test Taking or works as a Standardized Test Taker.  The Princeton Review books and the real practice exams were very effective in boosting my scores but had nothing to do with helping me in the studies they were prerequisites for.\n\nThe SAT I, ACT, and GRE exams send a negative message to students - that gaming the system is more important than learning.  There is something seriously wrong with a system in which memorizing a few hundred vocabulary words and taking practice exams is a far more efficient way to earn brownie points than actual learning is.\n\nUnfortunately, standardized testing is trickling down, as the K-12 educational system is putting MORE emphasis on standardized tests.  It isn't just the top students who have to worry about standardized test scores - all the other students, the teachers, the principals, and the school districts now have to worry too.  Students are threatened with the prospect of not graduating, the people working for the school are threatened with the prospect of being fired, and the districts are threatened with the prospects of funding cuts or even termination.\n\nWhat's happening is that more and more schools spend more and more time teaching to the test.  This can only dumb down the students in the long run, as anything not on the test is blown off.  It also discourages teachers.  I personally know an individual who used to teach Spanish at a junior high school in Richmond, VA.  Students, parents, and the school kept blowing her off because everyone was obsessed with the mandatory SOL exam, and Spanish wasn't on it.  As a result, she quit teaching.\n\nIn the Soviet Union, the workers had the saying, \"We pretend to work, and they pretend to pay us.\"  The motto of our educational system is becoming one of \"We pretend to learn, and they pretend to teach us.\"\n\nWhen I was a K-12 student in the 1980s and early 1990s, we did have standardized tests, but the teachers and principals weren't fixated on them.  The test results were used to supplement grades in deciding how to place us.  You might call me an old coot, but people did get educated in those days.  And no, we didn't walk 6 miles in the ice and snow to go to a one-room schoolhouse.  Yes, the USA had 50 states.  (Admittedly, there weren't as many nations.)

He is very likeable, well-spoken, and passionate about his interests.  I'm only exaggerating slightly with familial bias when I say there is nothing not to like.\n\nAgain, I want to protect his anonymity, so I didn't list every math award, every National Merit-type thing, but they're there too.  I think the list above speaks for itself.  Interview and essay were both solid.\n\nWell, at this point, you've probably anticipated the purpose of the thread:\n\nHarvard recruited him over the summer of junior year with phone calls, email, and mail.  He visited and it became his first choice.  Then Harvard deferred him.  He sent a nice follow-up letter, emphasizing continued accomplishements and interest in the school.  Then they waitlisted him.\n\nHowever, another top-10 school accepted him without recruitment with a designation that ranked him in the top 0.5% of their applicant pool.\n\nSo, what to make of that?  You can draw whatever conclusions you want, but ultimately the message is c'est la vie.  View this as a sort of allegory: this is in many respects represents the perfect non-legacy non-URM non-singlefaceted non-recruitedathlete applicant.  Once you take away each of those categories, each school has some number of slots for the well-rounded genuises like this person.  For whatever reasons, they don't always get in.\n\nSo if you applied somewhere and didn't get the result you wanted, all those people who seem to be feeding you platitudes to make you feel better are actually telling you the truth.  It is a crapshoot, at least to some extent.  And if you're applying in the future, look at lots of top schools, no matter how obscenely well-qualified you are.

There are many cuases that create these emotions, ranging from someone's death to a report card that got mailed home. HOwever, it is sorrow that is created by one's own folly that is the most painful and profound. While other sorrows are caused by factors that are out of our own reach, ones we create ourselves happened precisely because of our decision; this causes us to feel, in addition, to sorrow, a deep regret and self-chastisement. This was the case for scientists who created genetically modified plants and character, Dr. Frankenstein, from Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, who created a human being.\n\nScientists who created genetically modified plants that eventually turned into a disaster felt the greatest sorrow - precisely because they themselves were responsible for the disaster. In 1998, a group of scientists from Harvard University devised a way to genetically modify plants. At first, these plants yielded more products. However, the scientists failed to forsee the biological disaster that these new hybrid plants would bring. These plants turned into \"super weeds,\" rampant plants that drain the soil ravenously. In the end, the scientists had no one else to blame but themselves for this ecological calamity. This sense of compunction doubled by the actual greif caused by the situation itself resulted in the greatest sorrow.\n\nWhile scientists merely created disastrous plants, Dr. Frankenstein makes a human, which later turns into a monster, resulting in his unfathomable sorrow. As a bright scientist, Dr. Frankenstein devises a way to put pieces of corpses together and blow sparks of life into the creature. Fortunately and unfortunately, his experiment works. The \"human\" he creates becomes maddened by Dr. Krankenstein's reluctance to accept him. The \"human,\" then, turns into a monster and slaughters his creator's relatives. Dr. Frankenstein feels the greatest sorrow, precisely because it is his own creation that is causing the grief. Throughout the course of the novel, the scientist regrets making the creature. He feels responsible for the deaths of his relatives. And, of course, the deaths themselves create a source of great suffering for him. All in all, Dr. Frankenstein is weighed down by sense of guilt, sorrow, and remorse -  the greatest grief possible.\n\nAs demonstrated by scientists who created genetically modified plants and Dr. Frankenstein who creates a \"human,\" it is clear that our greatest sorrows are not created by our enemies, but, surprisingly, by ourselves.\n\n\n\n*please grade it as if the factual errors about the modified plants were correct. I just made that up on the spot and plan to do some research on it; it won't happen again!\n\n\n\nThanks in advance                "}, {"date": "2005-08-24T23:43:18+00:00", "url": "http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/california-institute-technology/91813-foreign-language-for-a-rec-letter.html", "messages": "\n                    The English department at my school is protesting the increased hours - decreased wages that have come as a result of Texas being stupid with its money in regard to education.

My writing seemed so much the worse.  Please, read my essays and tear them apart.  I realize that they are cut and dry.\nCommon App Essay:\nWhat is it about an eighty year old New Yorker with a raspy voice, unshapely nose, and inch thick specs--a man who I've never even had the honor of shaking hands with\u0097 that would win my admiration?  Joe Paterno, head football coach for Penn State, has not only won my admiration, but also has had a significant influence on the way I live my life.  Paterno is a sort of Renaissance man, not just excelling in the coaching profession, but also a scholar, humanitarian and a great leader.\nMost people think of football coaches as unintelligent and uncultured.  Although this may be true, Joe Paterno is certainly an exception.  He attended an Ivy League University (Brown) and went on to earn three doctoral degrees, a feat that few can match.  During his late high school and college years, Paterno developed an interest in Latin and Greek Literature, which has become a life-long passion;  he has been recognized for his interpretations of Virgil.  He instills this erudite attitude upon his players, expecting them to be true scholar- athletes.  Paterno made me realize just how valuable my education was, that no matter what I would go on to do in life, with knowledge, my life would be so much more fulfilled.  When I first learned of Paterno's interest in classical literature, I was befuddled: what value would a football coach find in Virgil?  Out of interest, I read the Aenied and other works, and quickly learned why; my life become enriched\u0097actually it was the first time that I discovered the value of literature.\nPerhaps Paterno's second strongest reputation\u0097after coaching\u0097is his dedication to his community.  His community has been mostly the Penn State University, to which he has donated around five million dollars for a better library system.  He has also helped to hold fundraisers for the school, using his fame to garner millions of dollars.  However, his volunteerism has extended beyond the university; Paterno served as chairman of the American Cancer Society.  He's been able to accomplish all this while working a very busy schedule.  It made me realize that no matter how busy I am, I still have an obligation to help my community.  During high school, I've made a point of finding time to help out around the community and the lessons I've learned from these experiences have certainly inspired a sense of volunteerism within me.\nFew college football coaches have achieved the level of success that Paterno has, evidenced by his 349 wins (at press time), second only to Bobby Bowden.  His success on the field is testament to his strong leadership capabilities, a quality that I have continuously tried to emulate.  Paterno leads by example, through hard work and passion.  In the leadership positions I've held in high school, I've also dedicated my time to the betterment of the club.  I, like him, have tried to gain the esteem of those who I lead.\nThese admirable qualities of Joe Paterno have been hidden beneath the success that he has had on the field. Nevertheless, I've been able to discover them from his various writings and as a result, my life has become the better.  He has taught me to live life with passion, whether it be my profession, education, or community.  I have in a way modeled my life after Joe Paterno, whose every quality I find admirable.\nAdditional Essay:\nI don't know what it was that instilled in me a love of doing research. Was it winning the middle school science fair?  Was it because I might discover something great?  Whatever it was, research has become an integral aspect of my high school experience.  Now looking back, I realize how far I've come, from discovering that Energizer batteries lived longer than Duracells to doing lab work on the detection of single nucleotide polymorphisms on gamma amino butyric acid gene sequences.\nMy first experience with higher level science (that is beyond the middle school Science Fair) was in Hong Kong, where my aunt is a renowned researcher at the Hong Kong Institute of Science and Technology. That summer, I arrived in Hong Kong thinking I'd find a cure for cancer or something, but was quickly humbled.  I had enough trouble just trying to hook up a basic gel electrophoresis machine up correctly, and boy, did my hands hurt after squeezing miniscule amounts of some chemical from a pipette into a vial thousands of times.   The experience was thoroughly frustrating, as when a whole experiment would be ruined because I put 5 extra micro- liters of buffer into a PCR machine.  Nevertheless, I was able to duplicate the results of an experiment done on the genetic basis of alcoholism\u0097although my success was probably due to sheer coincidence\u0097which really rejuvenated my interest in laboratory research.  I left Hong Kong with more than sore hands, but with the realization that research is a tedious, frustrating but at the same time, very rewarding process.\nAfter I returned home, I decided that I would do commence a research project of my own.  After racking my brain for ideas, I hit upon one that interested me: the relationship between blood type and personality.  I had read about this idea and wondered if there was any empirical evidence to support it.  I started doing research and found that it had not been studied in great detail.  At first, I had lofty ideas, such as using the correlation between blood type and personality to find a mystery personality gene, but quickly found that that was virtually impossible.  The restrictions on my research\u0097 whether it was the lack of funds to buy professional personality inventories, or the fact that I wasn\u0092t licensed to administer one, or my shortcomings on complex statistical calculations\u0097bound me within strict confines and again humbled me.  Nevertheless, I was able to test nearly one thousand subjects and am currently working on compiling the report.\nI doubt that my research so far will ever make a significant impact on the scientific community, but the lessons that I've learned doing research have laid the foundations for the future.  For one thing, I've finally realized why we're not living on Mars or why there isn't a cure for cancer yet.\n\nThanks                "}, {"date": "2005-10-16T03:10:39+00:00", "url": "http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/what-my-chances/105696-chances-for-me-to-get-into-suny-binghamton.html", "messages": "\n                    I visited Binghamton's open house today, and I really like the college.

Here is my abstract:\n\nThis paper discusses a novel approach to the development and evolution of connections that form between neurons in the brain and the emergence of intelligence, as well as the construction of a simulation designed to test these ideas, with a heavy emphasis on the runtime analysis of the simulation. The concepts and methods proposed in this paper contribute to the disciplines of artificial intelligence and neuroscience, with strong ties to the cognitive development of the human infant.\nThe simulation consists of a virtual species that learns to adapt to a hostile, dynamic and evolving environment, with members of the species differentiated only by their intellectual abilities. The brain of a member of this species is composed of two neural networks: the prediction network, a recurrent neural network that employs a derivative of the standard back propagation algorithm, and a situation analysis, a feed forward neural network trained by a periodically run genetic algorithm, enabling the evolution of the species. Together, the two networks generate a large look-ahead tree, and evaluate it.\nThe most recent results of this simulation support the runtime analysis presented, suggesting the strong dependencies of the discipline of artificial intelligence on the hardware advances in coming years.\n\n...\n\nobviously, anyone with knowledge in Comp Sci can see I don't actually have results.\n\nThe reason I am posting this here is because I am confused about the research fields I am interested in.

The data from the study represent admissions disadvantage and advantage in terms of SAT points (on 1600-point scale):\n\n* Blacks: +230\n* Hispanics: +185\n* Asians: \u221250\n* Recruited athletes: +200\n* Legacies (children of alumni): +160\n\nStudy (PDF)\n\n( http://opr.princeton.edu/faculty/tje/espenshadessqptii.pdf )\n\nThe estimates for blacks, and to a lesser extent Hispanics, probably understate the disparity. Standardized tests tend to overpredict for individual, high-scoring members of populations with weaker test scores . (One's SAT score predicts a certain level of performance. If one performs above this level, the test underpredicted; if the reverse, it overpredicted.) Thus, according to these analyses, accounting for group differences, a white with a score of 1,200 would actually be more, not equally, able on average than a black or Hispanic with the same score. Critics say that this failure to adjust scores to improve the test's predictive validity distorts the true scores of minorities, and indirectly everyone, as admissions is a zero sum game. Adjusting for this tendency would likely result in more controversy, however, as it is easily misconstrued.\n\nAdditionally, class rank, a statistic widely used in admissions, likely confers advantage on underperforming minorities. In California, Florida, and Texas public universities, affirmative action has been replaced with class rank and other programs. Class rank tends to discriminate against those at relatively competitive high schools, simply because high schools are not uniform in student ability. Thus a student with grades in the top ten percent at a mediocre school is unlikely to be equivalent or superior to a student at an elite school. Class rank, as a result, is more a measure of one's peers than of oneself. As such, some high schools refuse to rank their students.\n\nSource: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affirmative_action#Implementation_in_universities\n\nThis is pretty interesting article about AA in Wikipedia, which uses Princeton University as an example.

I believe Mr. Webb raises some very important issues.\n\n================================\nPurple Heartbreakers\n\n\nBy JAMES WEBB\nPublished: January 18, 2006\n\nArlington, Va.\n\nIT should come as no surprise that an arch-conservative Web site is questioning whether Representative John Murtha, the Pennsylvania Democrat who has been critical of the war in Iraq, deserved the combat awards he received in Vietnam.\n\nAfter all, in recent years extremist Republican operatives have inverted a longstanding principle: that our combat veterans be accorded a place of honor in political circles. This trend began with the ugly insinuations leveled at Senator John McCain during the 2000 Republican primaries and continued with the slurs against Senators Max Cleland and John Kerry, and now Mr. Murtha.\n\nMilitary people past and present have good reason to wonder if the current administration truly values their service beyond its immediate effect on its battlefield of choice. The casting of suspicion and doubt about the actions of veterans who have run against President Bush or opposed his policies has been a constant theme of his career. This pattern  of denigrating the service of those with whom they disagree risks cheapening the public's appreciation of what it means to serve, and in the long term may hurt the Republicans themselves.\n\nNot unlike the Clinton \"triangulation\" strategy, the approach has been to attack an opponent's greatest perceived strength in order to diminish his overall credibility. To no one's surprise, surrogates carry out the attacks, leaving President Bush and other Republican leaders to benefit from the results while publicly distancing themselves from the actual remarks.\n\nDuring the 2000 primary season, John McCain's life-defining experiences as a prisoner of war in Vietnam were diminished through whispers that he was too scarred by those years to handle the emotional burdens of the presidency. The wide admiration that Senator Max Cleland gained from building a career despite losing three limbs in Vietnam brought on the smug non sequitur from critics that he had been injured in an accident and not by enemy fire. John Kerry's voluntary combat duty was systematically diminished  by the well-financed Swift Boat Veterans for Truth in a highly successful effort to insulate a president who avoided having to go to war.\n\nAnd now comes Jack Murtha. The administration tried a number of times to derail the congressman's criticism of the Iraq war, including a largely ineffective effort to get senior military officials to publicly rebuke him (Gen. Peter Pace, chairman of the Joint Chiefs, was the only one to do the administration's bidding there).\n\nNow the Cybercast News Service, a supposedly independent organization with deep ties to the Republican Party, has dusted off the Swift Boat Veterans playbook, questioning whether Mr. Murtha deserved his two Purple Hearts. The article also implied that Mr. Murtha did not deserve the Bronze Star he received, and that the combat-distinguishing \"V\" on it was questionable. It then called on Mr. Murtha to open up his military records.\n\nCybercast News Service is run by David Thibault, who formerly worked as the senior producer for \"Rising Tide,\" the televised weekly news magazine produced by the Republican National Committee. One of the authors of the Murtha article was Marc Morano, a long-time writer and producer for Rush Limbaugh.\n\nThe accusations against Mr. Murtha were very old news, principally coming from defeated political rivals. Aligned against their charges are an official letter from Marine Corps Headquarters written nearly 40 years ago affirming Mr. Murtha's eligibility for his Purple Hearts - \"you are entitled to the Purple Heart and a Gold Star in lieu of a second Purple Heart for wounds received in action\" - and the strict tradition of the Marine Corps regarding awards. While in other services lower-level commanders have frequently had authority to issue prestigious awards, in the Marines Mr. Murtha's Vietnam Bronze Star would have required the approval of four different awards boards.\n\nThe Bush administration's failure to support those who have served goes beyond the smearing of these political opponents. One of the most regrettable examples comes, oddly enough, from modern-day Vietnam. The government-run War Remnants Museum, a popular tourist site in downtown Ho Chi Minh City, includes an extensive section on \"American atrocities.\" The largest display is devoted to Bob Kerrey, a former United States senator and governor of Nebraska, recipient of the Medal of Honor and member of the 9/11 commission.\n\nIn the display, Mr. Kerrey is flatly labeled a war criminal by the Vietnamese government, and the accompanying text gives a thoroughly propagandized version of an incident that resulted in civilian deaths during his time in Vietnam. This display has been up for more than two years. One finds it hard to imagine another example in which a foreign government has been allowed to so characterize the service of a distinguished American with no hint of a diplomatic protest.\n\nThe political tactic of playing up the soldiers on the battlefield while tearing down the reputations of veterans who oppose them could eventually cost the Republicans dearly. It may be one reason that a preponderance of the Iraq war veterans who thus far have decided to run for office are doing so as Democrats.\n\nA young American now serving in Iraq might rightly wonder whether his or her service will be deliberately misconstrued 20 years from now, in the next rendition of politically motivated spinmeisters who never had the courage to step forward and put their own lives on the line.\n\nRudyard Kipling summed up this syndrome quite neatly more than a century ago, writing about the frequent hypocrisy directed at the British soldiers of his day:\n\nAn' it's Tommy this, an' Tommy that, an' anything you please;\n\nAn' Tommy ain't a bloomin' fool - you bet that Tommy sees!\n\nJames Webb, a secretary of the Navy in the Reagan administration, was a Marine platoon and company commander in Vietnam.

They\ntake measurements and record results as if the\ncollection of data were sole object of their (5)\nlives. The assumption: If one gathers enough facts\nabout something, the relationships between those\nfacts will spontaneously reveal themselves.\nNonsense!\nThe myth of the infallible scientist evaporates (10)\nWhen one thinks of the number of great ideas in\nScience whose originators were correct in general\nbut wrong in detail. The English physicist John\nDalton (1766-1844) gets credit for modern atomic\nTheory, but his mathematical formulas for calcu- (15)\nlating atomic weights were incorrect. The Polish\nastronomer Copernicus, who corrected Ptolemy\u0092s\nancient concept of an Earth-centered universe,\nnevertheless was mistaken in the particulars of the\nplanets\u0092 orbits. (20)\nLuck, too has played a determining role in\nscientific discovery. The French chemist Pasteur\ndemonstrated that life does not arise spontane-\nously from air. But it may have been luck that he\nhappened to use an easy-to-kill yeast and not the (25)\nhay bacillus that another, long-forgotten, investiga-\ntor had chosen for the experiment. We now\nknow that hay bacillus is heat-resistant and grows\neven after the boiling that killed Pasteur\u0092s yeast. If\nPasteur had used the hay bacillus, his \u0093proof\u0094 (30)\nwould not have materialized.\nGregor Mendel, the founder of modern genetics,\nepitomizes the humanness of the scientist. Plant\nhybridization intrigued and puzzled Mendel, an\nAugustinian monk with some training in mathe- (35)\nmatics and the natural sciences. He had read in\nthe professional literature that crosses between\ncertain species regularly yielded many hybids\nwith identical traits; but when hybrids were\ncrossed, all kinds of strange new combinations of (40)\ntraits cropped up. The principle of inheritance,\nif there was one, was elusive.\nMendel had the basic idea that there might be\nsimple mathematical relationships among plants\nin different generations. To pursue this hypothesis, (45)\nhe decided to establish experimental plots in the\nmonastery garden an Brunn, raise a number of vari-\neties of peas, interbreed them, count and classify\nthe offspring of each generation, and see whether\nany reliable mathematical ratios could be deduced. (50)\nAfter many years of meticulously growing, har-\nvesting, and counting pea plants, Mendel thought\nhe had something worth talking about. So in, 1865,\nhe appeared before the Brunn Society for the Study\nof Natural Science, reported on his research, and (55)\npostulated what have since come to be called the\nMendelian laws. Society members listened politely\nBut, insofar as anybody knows, asked few questions\nand engaged in little discussion. It may even be\nthat, as he proceeded, a certain suspicion emerged (60)\nout of the embarrassed silence. After all, Mendel\nlacked a degree and had published no research.\nNow, if Pasteur had advanced this idea\u0085.\nMendel\u0092s assertion that separate and distinct\n\u0093elements\u0094 of inheritance must exist, despite the (65)\nfact that he couldn\u0092t produce any, was close to\nasking the society to accept something on faith.\nThere was no evidence for Mendel\u0092s hypothesis\nother than his computations; and his wildly uncon-\nventional applications of algebra to botany made it (70)\ndifficult for his listeners to understand that those\ncomputations were the evidence.\nMendel undoubtedly died without knowing that\nHis findings on peas had indeed illuminated a well-\nnigh universal pattern. Luck had been with him in (75)\nhis choice of which particular traits to study. We\nnow know that groups of genes do not always act\nindependently. Often they are linked, their effect\nbeing to transmit a \u0093package\u0094 of traits. Knowing\nnothing about genes, let alone the phenomenon (80)\nof linkage, Mendel was spared failure because the\ntraits that he chose to follow were each controlled\nseparately. * The probability of making such a\nhappy choice in random picks is only about 1 in\n163!\n\n* Some scientists believe that Mendel actually did have some idea of linkage and did choose traits purposefully\n\n\nQuestions:\n21. The word \u0093Nonsense!\u0094 (line 9) conveys the\nextent to which the authors\n\n(A) object to the tendency of scientist to rely\non existing data\n(B) reject the way in which scientist are\nportrayed in the media\n(C) are amused at the accidental nature of\nsome scientific findings\n(D) oppose the glorification of certain scien-\ntists at the expense of others\n(E) realize the necessity of objectivity in research\n\n22. The authors cite the example of Copernicus\n(lines 16-20) to substantiate which of the\nfollowing claims?\n\n(A) The achievements of scientists are not\nalways recognized.\n(B) Scientific progress depends on a variety of\nfactors.\n(C) Scientists often suffer from professional\njealousy and competition.\n(D) Noted scientists are not always wholly\naccurate in their theories.\n(E) A scientist may stumble on an important\ntruth accidentally.\n\n23. The term \u0093humanness\u0094 (line 33) as it is applied\nto Mendel refers to\n\n(A) the tendency to rely excessively on emotion\n(B) an interest in improving the human condi-\ntion through scientific research\n(C) an attitude of forgiveness toward those\nwho underrated him\n(D) a combination of intellect, intuition, and\ngood fortune\n(E) a talent for preserving in the face of oppo-\nsition\n\n24. In the passage, Pasteur\u0092s use of a certain yeast\nis comparable to\n\n(A) a previous investigator\u0092s use of the hay\nbacillus\n(B) Dalton\u0092s discovery of atomic weigths\n(C) Mendel\u0092s choice of traits to study\n(D) Copernicus\u0092 study of the universe\n(E) Mendel\u0092s use of mathematical ratios\n\n25. In lines 61-63, the authors imply that in\ncomparison to Mendel, Pasteur\n\n(A) was a more proficient researcher\n(B) based his theories on more extensive\ninvestigations\n(C) possessed a more impressive professional\nreputation\n(D) was more meticulous in his observations\n(E) devoted more energy to promoting his\nscientific ideas\n\n26. The \u0093universal\u0094 (line 75) refers to\n\n(A) the initial skepticism with which new\nideas are received\n(B) a tendency of botanists to resists purely\ntheoretical proof\n(C) the way peas tend to exhibit the quality of linked traits\n(D) the way traits usually reappear in succeeding generations\n(E) a similarity between Mendel\u0092s experiments\nand those of succeeding geneticists\n\n27. The word \u0093happy\u0094 (line 84) most nearly means\n\n(A) joyful\n(B) fortunate\n(C) willing\n(D) dazed\n(E) pleasing\n\n28. The passage suggests that Mendel\u0092s contempo-\nraries assumed that valid biological theories\n\n(A) are often proposed by inexperienced\nresearchers\n(B) cannot be based on mathematical proof\nalone\n(C) must be supported by years of careful\nresearch\n(D) often represent a departure from estab-\nlished practice\n(E) must be circulated to a wide audience\n\n29. The passage suggests that Mendel\u0092s experi-\nments succeeded because\n\n(A) Mendel was able to convince his col-\nleagues to support his research\n(B) Mendel discovered flaws in his research\ndesign and corrected them\n(C) Mendel had a thorough understanding of\nthe concept of linked traits\n(D) the scientific community finally under-\nstood the connection between mathe-\nmatiical computations and heredity\n(E) the traits in peas happen to reappear in a\ndistict and predictable way\n\n30.

As one of the interviewers, I can tell you that they AS A WHOLE went very well. (Thats not to say there weren't a few screw ups). I don't know if I actually interviewed any of you personally or not, so there are-- of course-- no guarantees.\n\nWhat I can tell you is that the interview results were taken into serious consideration when choosing scholarship recipients (I'm not sure if the letters have gone out yet...), so if you do recieve a scholarship..bravo! you probably had a great interview. If not, it doesn't mean that your interview went terribly...just that there were a lot of qualified applicants and we really had to pin the best against the best.\n\nThis was the first year for interviews, that much is true. The reason for the interviews this year is that as the school becomes more competitive there are a lot more well qualified applicants that can recieve these scholarships. I can tell you that in the interviews we were only looking at the top 2% of applicants, so if you even had an interview at all you can pat yourself on the back. However, GPAs and SAT scores only go so high, so the number of applicants in the \"top 2%\" is growing and growing each year! This is why it was decided that we needed something else to go by:  interviews.\n\nThere was a set list of questions for the interviewers to try to cram into that half hour time slot we had to meet with you. So we did our best, and I apologize if it seemed you were badgered uncontrollably with questions you could hardly keep up with...that wasn't our intention! If your interviewers took notes (my team personally, didn't)...don't worry they weren't writing down your answers! The purpose of the interview was to get a general judge of character. Believe it or not, it wasn't a test. The results of each interview were of course very subjective which is why there was more than one person interviewing you (it's always nice to have more than one opinion on such an important decision).\n\nAt the end of the interview we ranked 1-5 on whether we thought a scholarship should be awarded and why, according to the criteria that was laid out by each scholarship description.\n\nFrom the end of the interviewer, these scholarship interviews were a great success. I hope you guys feel the same way! If you have any questions, feel free to post back and I'll do my best to answer. There are certain things that I probably can't tell you, but for generalized questions...shoot away.

Dentists and Suicide: While statistics don't exactly prove that dentists have higher suicide rates in comparison with white collar jobs, many sources seem to say that the work is monotonous and the life quite stagnant, isolated, and lonely, and thus resultant in psychological problems in many a dentist. They claimed that it was emotionally draining having to work in a small dark space (the patient's mouth) the entire day, and physically draining having to sit for long spans of time with the back bent uncomfortably.\n\n2. Risk of Exposure: Obviously dentists must be meticulous in creating a sterile environment for patients, but many sources say that there is high risk of infection by bloodborne pathogens. They also say that the dentist must guard his ears to avoid the intense grinding noise of the drill, and that exposure to nitrous oxide over time contributes to psychologica/behavioral problems, which pretty much tie back in to no.1 on this list.\n\n3. Dentist Phobia: Finally, these sources claim that there exists almost a universal hate for dentists. There are numerous phobias surrounding dentists in all sectors of the population. Dentists are many a time perceived as sadists, unlike their kind and friendly, patient-oriented physician counterparts. Is it discouraging for a dentist that many a person loathes going to visit him?\n\nI myself feel more helped upon leaving the dentist's office than  the physician's, possibly because the results are more concrete. A dentist's work is, to me, very valuable and necessary. I have had, moreover, only positive encounters with dentists over the years. I'd like to know of your actual experiences as a dentist regarding these claims, because I certainly don't want to be scared off for nothing. I realize that there are real and perceived negative aspects attached to all professions.

The assertion that qualified white students are being displaced by less qualified minority students was a prime plaintiff argument in the 2003 U.S. Supreme Court cases against the University of Michigan (Gratz v. Bollinger and Grutter v. Bollinger).\n\n\n\"We're trying to put these admission preferences in context so people understand that lots of students, including those with SAT scores above 1500, are getting a boost,\" said Espenshade, the professor of sociology who co-authored \"The Opportunity Cost of Admission Preferences at Elite Universities\" with Chung, a senior technical staff member in the Office of Population Research. \"The most important conclusion is the negative impact on African American and Hispanic students if affirmative action practices were eliminated.\"\n\n\nAccording to the study, without affirmative action the acceptance rate for African-American candidates likely would fall nearly two-thirds, from 33.7 percent to 12.2 percent, while the acceptance rate for Hispanic applicants likely would be cut in half, from 26.8 percent to 12.9 percent. While these declines are dramatic, the authors note that the long-term impact could be worse.\n\n\n\"If admitting such small numbers of qualified African-American and Hispanic students reduced applications and the yield from minority candidates in subsequent years, the effect of eliminating affirmative action at elite universities on the racial and ethnic composition of enrolled students would be magnified beyond the results presented here,\" the report says.\n\nThe authors also cite other studies and the actual experience of the University of California system where affirmative action has been eliminated: \"The impacts are striking. Compared to the fall of 1996, the number of underrepresented minority students admitted to the University of California-Berkeley Boalt Hall Law School for the fall of 1997 dropped 66 percent from 162 to 55.... African-American applicants were particularly affected as their admission numbers declined by 81 percent from 75 to 14, but acceptances of Hispanics also fell by 50 percent. None of the 14 admitted African-American students chose to enroll. Of the 55 minority students admitted, only seven enrolled in the fall of 1997, a falloff that had the effect of reducing the underrepresented minority share in the first year class to 5 percent in 1997 compared with 26 percent in 1994.\"\n\n\nRemoving consideration of race would have little effect on white students, the report concludes, as their acceptance rate would rise by merely 0.5 percentage points. Espenshade noted that when one group loses ground, another has to gain -- in this case it would be Asian applicants. Asian students would fill nearly four out of every five places in the admitted class not taken by African-American and Hispanic students, with an acceptance rate rising from nearly 18 percent to more than 23 percent. Typically, many more Asian students apply to elite schools than other underrepresented minorities. The study also found that although athletes and legacy applicants are predominantly white, their numbers are so small that their admissions do little to displace minority applicants.\n\n\nThe authors based their work on models previously developed in a 2004 study where they looked at more than 124,000 elite university applicants' SAT scores, race, sex, citizenship, athletic ability and legacy in combination with their admission decision. This more recent study honed in on more than 45,000 applicants. Both studies are part of the multidimensional National Study of College Experience, which is funded by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation.

Hopefully my 4 on the AP test will prove that I\u0092m not a complete idiot in the subject. \uf04a I am showing signs of recovery now though, so I should be back in tune for senior year\u0085 The saddest part is that all my other grades stayed the same or went up!\n\nI\u0092m basically a really lopsided individual. I excel in everything except (and this is a hugee except) MATH and SCIENCE. Every grade I\u0092ve gotten in the humanities has been an A and more rarely an A-. On the other hand, however, my science and math grades have only plummeted. My first B\u0092s were junior year (in AP chem. and honors trig first semester). It only got worse after I was blessed with Bell\u0092s Palsy and practically gave up on things I hate (namely, chem. and precalc. Which resulted in that C+ and B-). I would have an upward trend if it were not for those two subjects. :P Instead, it\u0092s gone down a little.\n\nDespite this, my GPA at the moment is not that bad.\n\nI want to double major in linguistics and ancient studies (preferably something related to ancient Egypt).\n\nSo, what are my chances at:\n\nReach:\nBrown\nCornell\nUPenn CAS\nYale\nSwarthmore\n\nHigh Match:\nGeorgetown FLL (EA?)\nU Chicago (EA)\nBerkeley\nUCLA\n\nMatch:\nBrandeis\nUC San Diego\nNYU\n\nSafety:\nRochester\nUC Santa Cruz\nBoston U\n\nI had wanted to ED to UPenn but I visited and really didn\u0092t like it enough to. So now I\u0092m stuck. I really like Brown but its departments in what I\u0092m looking for aren\u0092t particularly outstanding.\n\nI also know I have little to not shot at Yale\u0085 but I\u0092m applying anyway since it has wonderful departments in what I am interested in.\n\nThank you very much for any and all advice/pointers you can give me!

I knew it had a few drawbacks from his perspective, but I had heard some very good things about the campus and the school itself, so I was cautiously optimistic.\n\nUnfortunately, things just didn\u0092t click for him. As expected, the drawbacks (lack of a football team, lack of a local volunteer fire or rescue company) caught his attention right away. In addition, we discovered a few new things that were a problem (for him, they may be irrelevant for somebody else) that I\u0092ll include below.  But the biggest problem was that we just didn\u0092t feel the type of enthusiasm and \"spark\" that I expected and hoped for. It didn\u0092t help that the tour consisted of one poor guy for the 20+ people. I understand that it\u0092s summer and guides may be in short supply, but that\u0092s just too many people for one tour guide. Anyway, on to the review.\n\nLynchburg is in Lynchburg, VA. The area is beautiful, and Lynchburg itself is a medium-sized city with all the amenities \u0096 plenty of restaurants, bars, a nice historic area, good-sized mall, entertainment (including a minor league baseball team that is well supported by the city). The campus itself is in the city, but you wouldn\u0092t know it \u0096 surrounded by trees and hills and very pretty. There is a LOT of construction going on, which I took to be a good sign. They are clearly investing in the infrastructure. The biggest project is the renovation of Shellenberger Field \u0096 even without a football team, athletics are important here (Division III, ODAC Conference).\n\nStarted off with a PowerPoint presentation, two young ad reps tag-teaming the discussion. Some highlights:\n\n* Housing guaranteed all 4 years, but that doesn\u0092t necessarily mean \u0093on\u0094 campus. The college owns several houses bordering the campus where upperclassmen live, as well as themed housing (honors, Greek, etc). Halls are air-conditioned, some of the houses are. Overall, 85% live in college-owned housing. There is one all-Freshman dorm and one that is predominantly Freshman.  13% Greek, so not a huge presence on campus.\n\n* Nothing is really within walking distance off campus. The campus is in a residential area of Lynchburg. To get to the main commercial area of Lynchburg a car is needed. The college does offer a shuttle service in Sept. and October, but demand usually tapers off as people make friends with upperclassmen with cars. Freshmen may not have cars \u0096 big turnoff for my son.\n\n* Rolling admissions, usually will hear 2-4 weeks after the application is complete. Essay and recommendations are encouraged but not required. Lynchburg is a common app school as well (not sure how this works \u0096 I don\u0092t believe you can complete the common app without submitting the essay, which contradicts the \u0093essay optional\u0094 thing).\n\n* Generous merit aid, and easy to determine up front \u0096 based on GPA and SAT/ACT scores. As an example: 1100 SAT and 3.0 OR 1200/2.75 will result in an $11K scholarship. Scholarship amounts range from $3K \u0096 $12K. They will also, upon request, provide an estimate of overall aid (merit + need) at any time, even before application \u0096 just contact the Admissions Office\n\n* 13:1 student/faculty ratio. The larger intro courses may go up to 40-50 people.\n\n*  Out of state students --  35%, 60-40 female-male ratio\n\n* They do have an honors program (Westover Honors) by invitation. Special housing, smaller classes, etc.\n\n* Someone asked about a gap year and it was really discouraged quite strongly. They do allow it, but I was surprised at how negative the ad rep was.\n\n*  Campus is not dry. Alcohol is allowed on campus for those 21+.\n\nAfter the presentation it was on to the tour. As noted, there were just too many people for a good tour, and it was starting to get blistering hot and muggy. Some highlights.\n\n* Started at Centennial Hall, the newest academic building. Very, very nice. Houses the communications and business schools, and has classes for other departments as well. Very impressive communications equipment, studios, edit rooms. Mock trading floor was state of the art. Classrooms were roomy, but the desks were really small \u0096 definitely smaller than the high school desks I\u0092ve been sitting in for back to school night for the last 3 years. The comment that the desks were actually slightly newer and slightly larger than those in other buildings was a bit alarming. Let\u0092s just say that it is quite obvious that they will need to buy a lot of new desks if they ever introduce football. :)\n\n* The residence hall was clean and well-maintained. Layout and size of the room was pretty standard.\n\n* Athletic facilities were top notch, including the fitness center. The renovation of Shellenberger field should result in a top facility. I thought it was kind of neat that the field is overlooked by three upperclass dorms \u0096 you can watch the action from your room.\n\n*  The campus layout is generally in a circle around the open area they call the \u0093dale\u0094 rather than the quad. Which I guess makes sense because it\u0092s not a quadrangle shape :). Nicely maintained campus, lots of trees and grass. The center of the dale is the Friendship Circle \u0096 the circle is bisected by all of the walkways in the main campus. The buildings are Georgian red brick style and quite attractive. Pretty compact campus, not spread out.\n\nThat\u0092s it. Overall, it\u0092s clear that Lynchburg has a lot to offer. I wish they had been more enthusiastic, though. Maybe it was just the heat, maybe it was just the lack of students -- a visit in the Fall could be completely different.

From the op-ed page of the New York Times:\n\nApplied Science\n\nBy JOHN ETCHEMENDY\nPublished: September 27, 2006\nStanford, Calif.\n\nHARVARD\u0092S and Princeton\u0092s recent announcements that they will soon end the early admission programs they now use to choose part of their freshman classes have garnered a great deal of attention, including editorials urging other institutions to follow their lead. It is a shame that the publicity, so abundant in its praise, has been so short on facts and clearheaded analysis.\n\nThere are two very different kinds of early admission programs offered by colleges and universities. Binding early admission contractually requires students who apply early and are accepted to attend the college that admitted them. Nonbinding early admission programs do not require admitted students to commit until the admission season ends in the spring. Students can meanwhile apply to other colleges in the regular round and make their decisions after they hear the results of those applications. Harvard, Stanford and Yale, for instance, have non-binding early programs; Princeton\u0092s early program is binding.\n\nOne complaint about early programs is that students accepted early do not have the opportunity to compare competing financial aid packages \u0097 they are locked in to attending the college that has already accepted them. This is a legitimate criticism of binding early admission programs, but it simply does not apply to non-binding programs. Students accepted in nonbinding programs can and do compare aid packages from all the colleges to which they are admitted.\n\nBy far the most common criticism of early admission programs is, to quote the presidents of both Harvard and Princeton, that these programs \u0093advantage the advantaged.\u0094 Critics point out that admission rates are somewhat higher in the early round than in the regular admission round. They assume that the pool of early applicants is disproportionately wealthier than those in the regular round. The conclusion seems inescapable: the wealthy are benefiting from the higher admission rates of early programs.\n\nThis reasoning is faulty, however. Consider an analogous situation. If you look at the pool of people who file income tax returns in January, you\u0092ll find that a higher percentage get a refund than those who delay until April. Does this imply that the I.R.S. is giving an unfair advantage to those who file early, that filing early increases your chances of getting a refund?\n\nOf course not: the I.R.S. refund standards are identical whether you file early or late. The difference is that those expecting a refund are more likely to file early, while those who owe money are inclined to wait. The pools are different; the standards are not. Those filing early are in no way \u0093advantaged.\u0094\n\nThere is nothing about early admissions, in itself, that gives an advantage to those who apply early. It all depends on whether the university imposes lower, the same, or higher standards to the early pool. Nor can you infer the standards by simply comparing admission rates in the early and late pools.\n\nThe admission rate is determined by two things: the standards applied and the qualifications of the applicants. If the early pool is, on average, more qualified, then applying precisely the same standard will result in a higher rate of acceptance.\n\nAt Stanford, we actually apply somewhat higher standards to our early pool, since we do not want to accept students early unless we\u0092re confident they would get in during the regular round. This is reflected in the SAT scores for these students: they average 40 points higher than those of students admitted later. It is not, however, reflected in our early acceptance rate, which is indeed somewhat higher than in the regular round.\n\nNo doubt some schools give an advantage to early applicants. If so, they are advantaging those applicants; if not, not. The problem, in any event, doesn\u0092t lie with early admissions programs but rather with the standards applied.\n\nHow about the assumption by critics that early programs are predominantly used by the wealthy? At Stanford, 36 percent to 40 percent of the students accepted early apply for financial aid; in the regular round only slightly more, 40 percent to 44 percent, seek aid. But even if our early pool were disproportionately well off, those applicants would not, as we have seen, get an admission advantage.\n\nThe final charge made by critics of early programs is that they increase the frenzy of the college admission process. This is certainly not true for those students who are clear about their first-choice college: they can apply to that institution early. If they get in, their admissions worries are over. If they do not, they can then submit applications to other schools, but are in no worse shape than if there were no early admission program.\n\nWithout such programs, many students who now apply to a single college will feel compelled to apply to 10 or more in order to be confident of an acceptance. This will increase the overall number of college applications, and that in turn will probably increase \u0097 not decrease \u0097 the pressure felt by all high school seniors going through the process.\n\nIndeed, early admission programs were originally intended to decrease that pressure. Done right, the programs do not give any advantage to those who apply in the early round, and students who are uncertain about where they want to go shouldn\u0092t feel that they must apply early.\n\nThe best way to decrease the frenzy of the admission season? Have colleges universally adopt nonbinding early admission programs, and then apply the same or higher standards to the early decisions as they do to the regular round. It\u0092s a solution that\u0092s fair for the students and practical for the colleges.\n\nJohn Etchemendy is the provost of Stanford University.

I had been having an increasing sense of dissatisfaction with my job over ten years\u0092 time, despite a track record of success, in a creative environment that offered challenging peers and assignments.\nOver time, in my work, I had had an increasingly gnawing sense of not doing anything important, although my awards and appointments suggested otherwise. After researching standards for career education for work, witnessing my high school children\u0092s struggles with career awareness, and acknowledging that my own career had evolved more through luck than through planning or preferences, my curiosity about Holland\u0092s Theory was peaked.  I took the Self-Directed Interest Survey.\nAt first, I was troubled and confused by the results, which indicated an overlap between the Enterprising and Social categories, since I actually thought of myself as Artistic. (This week\u0092s readings clarify, however, that two or more categories are quire common.) As a marketer, the Enterprising label made sense but the Social category took me by surprise.\nAlthough I had started my undergraduate studies in secondary education, I had never completed my certification, thinking the job was wrong for me, being a twenty-one-year old college graduate, and having been intimidated by my student teaching experience: supervising eighteen-year-old boys in remedial reading.\nSince 1978, then, I had not envisioned myself in a helping profession. I felt that I was on an irrevocable career track, which was my destiny. It was 1998 now, and I found that I had force-fit myself into a profession that, while \u0093creative\u0094 (and satisfying my Artistic self-concept), defined success by profits, rather than by bringing \u0093good work to the world\u0093 (which is how I thought of the helping professions and what I increasingly wanted, as I was affected by corporate management decisions being made that seemed incongruous).\nI had justified my occupation to myself until this time, because I believed (from parental influence) that being \u0093responsible\u0094 meant \u0093making the best financial situation for my family.\u0094 My efforts to create \u0093good work\u0094 were transferred to a corporate environment, which paid very well and satisfied me for awhile, since I worked in the \u0093social expressions\u0094 (greeting card) industry and then in the children\u0092s education business. I felt that the product itself brought a better quality of life to the world.\nInwardly, however, my self-concept was not fully realized through my work, because I always felt that working in a corporate environment, supervising the creators of these wonderful products, was a step away from the personal satisfaction for which I was looking.\nWhen I started to reexamine the career fields identified under the \u0093Social\u0094 category, I recalled how much I enjoyed my Psychology classes in college. It had never occurred to me to modify my undergraduate path in education. I had not had the benefit of a career counselor or advisor to guide me, when I had the bad experience in student teaching, and needed to plan for the future. Also, intellectually, my parents had me playing second fiddle to my math-inclined older brother. Lacking confidence in my teaching ability, I backed away from getting the certification and completed college with a \u0093Bachelor of Arts\u0094 in Speech and Theatre Arts, which was the only degree I could have completed by my desired graduation date. I never considered taking a different direction, (for example, staying in school a little longer to complete a Psychology degree).\nIn 2001, however, I decided to make the change that I knew by now was right for me. I was able to envision a fork in the road in my work as an educational publisher, and I developed a workbook for families called \u0093What\u0092s Your Major?\u0094 I presented the work to the local community college and was hired to teach some classes, based on my book. The experience was so rewarding that I decided to become an independent educational consultant, which will satisfy my self-concept as a Social personality.

But, as many newspaper reporters have observed, the idea of objectivity as a guiding principle is too valuable to be abandoned. Without it, the pursuit of knowledge is hopelessly lost.\n\nAdapted from \"Focusing Our Values,\" Nieman Reports\n\nAssignment: Are people better at making observations, discoveries, and decisions if they remain neutral and impartial? Support your position with reasoning and examples taken from your reading, studies, experiences, or observations.\n\n\nHave you ever heard a common proverb, \"Life is unfair\"? It seems that this world is filled with partisan words about others, and as a result, many events in the life are not necessarily fair.  Whether it's one's coach favoring specific players than other members or one's parent supporting certain child over another, life is unfair because people decide on emotions. If they made decisions, observations, and discovery by standing neutral and impartial, the world will be better place.\n\nThis critical example applies to the high school students and alcohol in this society.  Many students get invited to the parties where there are alcohols.  Sadly, parties with alcohol aren't fun as everyone believes.  I remember reading this article about death of three high school students by one other high school student. The other student became drunk and drove with his friends without curtailing his beer (he continued to drink even when he was drinking).  Then he failed to see the sharp bend on the road and crashed.  This student not only lost lives of his invaluable friends, but also he now has to go to jail for underage drinking and manslaughtering.  If he stopped to think whether it was impartial to risk lives by his own drinking, he probably didn't make this poor decision.\n\nClearly, some will object that these events only happen because they were only high school kids.  But what can you say about Sam Shepherd case? This was a case where a doctor got sentenced to jail for muderding his wife.  During the trial, the jury, which certainly moved by emotions, felt that he did kill his wife because he had an affair with nurse he worked.  So, even before he had chance to confess, people weren't fair to him and already condemned him as guilty.  Cases like this happen to anyone, and evidently, they don't result only to some \"high school kids.\"  If the Supreme Court really gave a fair trial as the Constitution of United States guaranteed, then maybe this man didn't have to waste ten years of his life (later, the court gave an acquittal so under proper trial, he was probably innocent).\n\nUndoubtedly, people can make better observations, discoveries by being neutral.

There is the bad kind, as when a person falsely promises to be your friend. But there is also a good kind, where the pretense eventually turns into the real thing. For example, when you are not feeling particularly friendly, the best thing you can do, very often, is to act in a friendly manner. In a few minutes, you may really be feeling friendlier. Adapted from a book by C.S. Lewis\n\nAssignment: Can deception--pretending that something is true when it is not--sometimes have good results? Plan and write an essay in which you develop your point of view on this issue. Support your position with reasoning and examples taken from your reading, studies, experience, or observations.\n\n\nPretense and deception may often have \"good\", or desirable results. Consider the world we live in: It is filled with deception and unfulfilled promises. But in the end, these false assertions have positive outcomes.\n\nFor example, we have politicians, who may as well be the most deceitful people on earth. They use pretense in every way imaginable; internally, they campaign with grand ideals to win elections. Externally, politicians befriend other politicians in order to accumulate personal power. The basis for both actions is pretense; the former obviously does not mean to actually carry out the said \"grand ideals\"--rather, they serve as an instrument for filling the ballot box. Since the candidate who makes the most promises, intended or not, is usually the one who is more popular, he or she has a higher chance of winning the election. The latter politician on the other hand is not allying with others because of a real personal connection or friendship; it is more of a symbolic, outwardly appealing act than anything else.\n\nThe important thing, however, is always the outcome. A promising-looking politician who wins an election may as well end up fulfilling his previously empty goals, and a \"fake\" relations between politicians can lead to improved economic, politiacl and military relations between countries. That is to say, deception is not inherently bad; the end can justify the means.\n\nPersonal experience has also taught me about the different uses of deception. I recall when I was in kindergarten, there was a group of boys whom I wanted to play with. Since they weren't friendly to me and I wasn't to them either, I gradually made it clear to them that I was \"on their side.\" By the end of that year, we were all running around happily. Although my demonstration of friendliness was originally meant only to allow myself into the play group, it eventually became a real friendship. This is just another indication that deception can do more than what it originally was intended to do.\n\n"}, {"date": "2007-02-19T06:14:26+00:00", "url": "http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/parent-cafe/302138-death-of-a-frequent-poster.html", "messages": "\n                    Mummified body found in front of CC web site\n\nhttp://today.reuters.com/news/articlenews.aspx?type=domesticNews&storyid=2007-02-17T211521Z_01_N17362175_RTRUKOC_0_US-DEATH-TELEVISION.xml&src=rss "}, {"date": "2007-03-05T06:03:22+00:00", "url": "http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/business-major/307814-applying-to-colleges-universities-soon-and-need-help.html", "messages": "\n                    This is my first post in this forum.

Therefore, I had to produce another essay which I'm about to post. Thanks for giving me scores. (I seriously need to learn self-scoring but I'm afraid that I'll be subjective :-P).\n\nPrompt: Can any obstacle or disadvantage be turned into something good?\n\nEssay:\n\nWhen General Douglas MacArthur was relieved from his position for talking to prive reporters, he said to America, \"Old soldiers never die, they just fade away.\"  To MacArthur, President Truman and Joint Chief of Staff had obliterated his career in United States Armed force.  but some historians view that his actions actually ameliorated him from a \"good\" soldier in the war to an \"excellent\" general who bravely stood with his beliefs.  Anyone can do what General MacArthur did\n\nto turn a bad situation (for him, President Truman) to something positive and perpetual.\n\nDespite his negative appearance to General Douglas, President Truman also overcame an obstacle.  Grown up in Missouri, Truman had lived through many jobs and failures and did not even go to the college.  As a result, President Roosevelt's sudden demise was a huge obstacle to Truman, who now then had to deal with world's powerful leaders such as Joseph Stalin and Winston Churchill.  But with his judicious ability as President, he not only finish the war safely but also, he made another stunning reelection as President.  His reelection was exceptionally impressive upset in Presidential election because the Democrats (his party) had another Democratic candidate running as well. Souther Democrats, known as \"Dixiecrats,\" refused to acknowledge Truman's civil rights plank, and everyone thought that the victory would go to Republican candidate Robert Dewey.  But with his incessant effort to overcome his bad situation, he successfully won against Dewey in very close race.\n\nRegarded as one of most brilliant geniuses of all time, Albert Einstein was another paragon of this case.  He fled from Europe to America to avoid Adolf Hitler's holocaust to Jews.  It certainly was an obstacle for him to adjust in the new life but also produced a good result as well.  Working along with Italian scientist Oppreheimer, he successfully created an atomic bomb to end Japan's cruel attempts to pillage and conquer the world.  Some people castigated that his so-called \"good\" act for United States brought several millions of deaths to Japan.  But, if it wasn't for Einstein and his atomic bomb, more people would have been killed for invasion of Japan by forces.\n\nIt is a course of life for humans to meet obstacles in their life.  It is not what obstacle that came but how they overcame it.

A Greenville High School junior shot and killed himself at school Wednesday morning, reports say.\n\nThe male student, whose name has not been released by officials, entered the instrument room, which is a storage area for band instrumets located next to the school?s band hall around 7:15 a.m. and shot himself, according to a statement released by the district.\n\nInitial reports had indicated that the student shot himself in front of several of his peers, but Greenville Police Chief Harold Roseberry said officers have not found any students who actually saw the suicide take place.\n\nThe student was then taken to Presbyterian Hospital of Greenville, where he was pronounced dead around 8 a.m.\n\n?Our thoughts, prayers and concerns are with the student?s immediate family as well as his extended school family,? the district said in its statement.\n\nBoth students and parents seemed shaken by the incident and the scene was chaotic at first.\n\n?People were leaving because they were upset and probably because they were freaked out,? said Nathan Moorman, a senior at the school, who was waiting with friends for the OK to enter the school for the day.\n\nStudents could be seen leaving the school crying, and most were talking on their cellphones. More than 100 parents immediately drove to school to pick up their children.\n\nThe rush to pick up the students resulted in a car crash in front of the school in which one person was taken to the hospital with minor injuries.\n\nOne parent even took off her high-heeled shoes and sprinted to the door to pick up her child. Another was waiting in the parking lot in her pajamas.\n\nRoseberry was even called to the scene to help direct traffic.\n\nBut, by 11 a.m., the street around the school was mostly empty. By 1:30 p.m., many of the students had already left school for the day, so district administrators released students an hour early.\n\nAdministrators also decided to cancel tonight?s previously scheduled open house at the high school.\n\nDespite the open house cancellation, the school will resume regularly scheduled classes today.\n\n?Additional counseling staff and local and area youth ministers have been made available and are present at GHS, and neighboring crisis intervention teams are available if necessary,? the district said in its statement.\n\nStudents arriving late to school Wednesday morning gathered together in groups in the school?s parking lot until they were allowed to enter the school.\n\n?It?s terrible,? said Jonathan Tapp, a senior at the school. ?The real thing it tells me is that a kid got into school with a gun.?\n\nWhat gun was used in the shooting and how the gun was brought onto campus is not known at this time.\n\nThe case is still being investigated and the student?s body was being transported to the Medical Examiner?s Office in Dallas for an autopsy, according to a statement released by the City of Greenville.\n\nHowever, GISD Superintendent Lloyd Graham sought to reassure both students and the public that the campus is safe.\n\n?We do not have metal detectors here,? Grham said. ?I cannot tell you how the gun came into the school. If I knew how the gun came into the school, we could have prevented that.\n\n?I do know that working in conjunction with the Harris Department of Education for Safe and Secure Schools, that we have already began a complete school district audit for safety practices (which was commenced in January) but I don?t have the results of what that may be or what it may tell us.?\n\nDuring a press conference late in the morning, Graham told reporters that it was a ?shooting at the school and not a school shooting.?\n\nAnd at one point during the press conference Graham stepped away to regain his composure.\n\n?The school is doing extremely well giving the constructs of what we?re dealing with here,? he said. ?Our staff has been tried and our student is being tested, but the body corporate as a whole at GHS is rising and ministering to everybody?s needs.?\n\nStudents interviewed immediately following the shooting were nervous about going into school and visibly shaken.\n\nSenior Brian Taylor said he knew the student who killed himself and had sometimes talked to him.\n\n?It?s just horrible,? Taylor said, ?It?s nerve-racking because a kid just killed himself in school.?\n\nParents were also shaken.\n\nRita Harmon, whose daughter is a cheerleader at the school, heard about the suicide shortly after it occurred from another parent, but details were initially fuzzy.\n\nShe said she was initially scared for her daughter?s safety until her daughter called a short time later to say she was OK.\n\n?I?m just thankful it wasn?t a kid who went crazy (and shot a lot of other students),? she said.

Thus, one should never judge anyone without first learning about their situation. This advice is evident in the Stanford Prison Experiment, Native Son, and my own personal experience.\n\nIn 1971, Philip Zimbardo led a team of Stanford researchers in an experiment to study the effects of captivity and power on the average person. They gathered a group of volunteers who were split into two groups, prisoners and guards, and placed in a makeshift \"prison\". The results startled the researchers. Once the volunteers became acclimated to their roles, the guards began to act increasingly violent toward the others. They dehumanized the prisoners and forced them to do menial labor. The prisoners eventually became mentally unstable and the experiment was cut short. Outside of this \"prison\", the volunteer guards were very normal people who would not have recognized themselves as the guards. Their aggressive behavior was merely a result of their surroundings and not an indicator of their true persona.\n\nRichard Wright's Native Son also demonstrates the importance of understanding environmental factors. The black protagonist, Bigger Thomas, accidentally suffocates a young woman and then tries to hide the accident. After a long chase, he is eventually caught and convicted of murder. Pressured by the townspeople, the judge sentences Bigger to death. Prejudicial views prevented society from understanding the actual circumstances behind the death.\n\nI have also witnessed the importance of recognizing another's motives. While waiting in line for tickets to a concert, a young man approached the front of the line. A few members from the group ahead of me yelled for him to wait in line like everyone else. Then, an older lady came and led the man away by his hand. It was then that the others realized the man was mentally handicapped and did not notice the line. They became ashamed of their remarks and wished they had been more considerate from the beginning.\n\nThus, we must withhold judgment of others until we can understand and appreciate their true motives, for many actions can be justified under appropriate circumstances.\n\nThank you!

Please feel free to share it with friends. Good luck!\n-- Carolyn Lawrence\n\nHOW TO MAKE THE FINAL COLLEGE CHOICE\n\nFor some students, making the final decision about which college to attend can be the toughest part of the admissions process. They find themselves riddled with doubt, overwhelmed with endless \"What ifs?\", and unable to choose.\n\nIf you're struggling with your college decision, here are some tips and tools to help you sort out the options:\n\n1. Stay as calm as possible. While this is an important decision, allowing yourself to be consumed with worry and fear will not help you make a better choice. Give yourself some breathing room if you have to -- you don't have to decide today, or even tomorrow. You have until May 1, so there is plenty of time. If you find yourself riddled with anxiety, it may help to just take a break, and do something fun and unrelated to college decisions for a few days.\n\n2. Start with YOU, not the colleges. Knowing yourself - your individual needs, desires, personality and goals - is just as important now as it was when you were drawing up your college list. Don't immediately jump in and start comparing colleges without first thinking about what really matters to you. Make a list of the top ten characteristics you think are most important in a college. Be specific, and try to focus on quantifiable factors (cost, size, location, academics, etc.) as well as intangibles (reputation, campus culture, etc.). Remember, this list is about what you think is important, not the factors your parents, your neighbors or your best friend think are important. Avoid asking everyone you know (and in some cases, even strangers) what you should do. They won't be the ones attending and they may be misinformed. The more opinions you get, the more confused you're likely to be. Stay focused on YOUR priorities, and YOUR decision. After you've compiled your list, rank the characteristics from 1 to 10 in importance, with 1 being the most important. If you find two characteristics seem equally important, try to figure out which one is more important to you, and assign it the higher value. The goal of this exercise is to help you identify which characteristics you value most, irrespective of which college you might ultimately attend. The result will give you a road map for comparing your college options.\n\n3. Accept that sometimes what we want is not achievable. This is sometimes the hardest part of making the final choice. Logically, you know that there are very good reasons why attending a certain college may not be possible. You weren't admitted, were placed on a waitlist with a cast of thousands, you didn't receive enough financial aid, or your family has had an unexpected change in circumstances that necessitates a change in your college plans. Often, discovering that a particular option is not possible makes us think that is the only good option. As a result, the other options we do have pale in comparison to what we can't have. It's always a bit sad to say good-bye to a college you've been admitted to but won't attend. You sweated over the application, you spent time perusing the viewbook, you visited campus -- but now, it is time to move on. Let yourself mourn a bit for what is not possible, then refocus on what is possible. If you've been waitlisted, there is nothing wrong with deciding to stay on the waitlist, but it is particularly important to act as if getting off will not happen. Treat your remaining options as if they are your only options (after all, for now, they are), and focus on deciding which of those choices are your preferred option.\n\n4. Evaluate each college separately before you start comparing them. It's a natural tendency to want to jump in and start comparing colleges to each other, but try to resist. Every college and university will have strengths and weaknesses - your goal is to identify the strengths and weaknesses of each school based on the criteria that matters most to you. Take the list of criteria you developed above, and evaluate each college separately on those characteristics. If you feel you don't have enough information to assess each college this way, take the time to do more research. Try to visit, go back through each school's website, ask questions of admissions, faculty, and current students, even pull out the old college guidebooks and read them again. However, don't just gather external information -- also look for internal information. Your personal feelings and gut instinct about each college is important to weigh as well.\n\n5. Narrow your list of options. After you've done the above, eliminate any college that only weakly matches your personal criteria. Remember - you can only attend one college in the end. While it may be hard to \"let go\" of options, it is a necessary step.\n\n6. Compare the remaining choices in pairs. If you still have more than two options, here is a good exercise to clarify your preferences. For this exercise, it is helpful to download this worksheet from Mindtools.com (http://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/worksheets/PairedComparisonWorksheet.pdf) Assign each of your remaining college options a letter, then write the name of the college in the corresponding slot along the top row and left hand column. You'll notice that some of the cells on the worksheet are blocked out so that you will never compare a college to itself or duplicate any pairing. Within the remaining cells, compare the college in the row with the one in the column. Decide which of the two college options is more important or preferable to you. Write down the letter of the more desirable option in that cell, and assign a score for the difference between the two from 0 (no major difference between the two) to 3 (major difference). As you go through the pairs, take notes about which differences seemed most important, as well as your thoughts about the differences between the pairs. Finally, add up the total of all of the values for each of your options. Does a particular college stand out as being most preferable when compared one on one to the others? Narrow your list further by eliminating any colleges that clearly did not stand up to any of the other options.\n\n7. Remind yourself that there are no right or wrong college choices, there are just different ones. Deciding where to attend college is the last step in the long and tiring college application process. It's easy to fall into the trap of believing that somehow there is only one college where you can be happy, get into a great graduate school, ensure future career success, and meet the love of your life. But that is not true. For every student, there are many colleges and universities where happiness and success can and will occur. In the end, your college experience will be defined more by the attitude with which you approach it than by the actual college you attend. After you've made your choice, go forward confident that you will be happy, that you have made a good choice, and that all will be well. Best of luck, and do let me know where you're heading!

However, this year, you were not teaching the courses that I needed to take, and as a result, I was no longer your charge.  (Technically, I was no longer your charge the moment I finished taking the final exam for your class.)  However, you made yourself available to me by saying that I could come to you whenever I needed help.  I gladly took you up on your offer, and I now feel like I know an adult (Well, an adult who is not between the ages of 18 and 24) in whom I can confide at this university.\n4.)\tYou made learning a second language more like playing a game than actually learning.  As a result, I am now majoring in a language that I almost decided to not even take at this university.  (My high school Spanish program was okay, but it wasn?t great.  When I entered my university as a freshman, I was almost sick of learning the language.)\n\nDuring my life, I?ve had several teachers who I really liked.  However, I believe that you are the best out of all of them.  None of my other teachers have gone out of their way to help me as much as you.  You've acted as a mentor, teacher, and friend.\n\nThanks again.

However, it may be applicable to any art, design or theater major. It will give you something to think about.\n__________________________________________________ ________\n\nBe advised: CMU themselves noted that total cost of tuition, room, board, fees and books will exceed $50,000 per year. This also doesn't count transportation home, medical insurance of $900 per year etc. The admission's officer that I spoke with mentioned that the actual cost is $52,000 per year if everything is filtered in. This also doesn't take into consideration future cost increases!\n\nSadly, whether you major in computer science, engineering or business, which can command some high paying jobs or art,which usually doesn't pay as well, the tuition, fees and room and board is the same.\n\nKakle, here is what it takes to amortize $150,000 of debt over 15 years:\n\nPrincipal borrowed: $150000.00\nAnnual Payments: 12 Total Payments: 180\nAnnual interest rate: 8.00% Periodic interest rate: 0.6667%\nRegular Payment amount: $1433.48 Final Balloon Payment: $0.00\n\nThe following results are estimates which do not account for values being rounded to the nearest cent. See the amortization schedule for more accurate values.\nTotal Repaid: $258026.40\nTotal Interest Paid: $108026.40\nInterest as percentage of Principal: 72.018%\n\nThus, they would need to pay $1,433 per month just to pay off their college debt! This is in addition to taxes,which takes up about one-third of their salary, mortgage or rent payments, car payments, food, insurance, gifts, travel, entertainment.etc. I think you get the message.\n\nAlso, for $100,000 in debt, the monthly cost to amortize it over 15 y ears would be $955.\n\n\nInterestingly, assuming no college debt, if you take the same $1433 per month and invest the money at 8% for the same 15 years, they would have $273,941 at the end of 15 years! Note, the same $1,433 per month for 30 years would be worth $582,107. For 40 years it would be worth: $808,960\n\n\n\nThus, unless you get some substantial scholarship money, tell me how a person who majors in art, education, music, drama, or other low paying major will be able to afford paying off this debt?\n\nNote: I am NOT saying that you shouldn't major in these areas. What I am saying is that, in my opinion, it isn't worth being in debt as a result of undergrad education more than about $50,000. If you need to go beyond that due to poor financial aid, you should seriously consider public university alternatives.

I'm going to be a junior next year and I figure I'm also going to need some advice. There are two colleges at the top of my list: UPenn and JHU. I already know they can offer me some of the best experience/education in terms of premedical studies and have friends who say good things about them. But first, a quick profile of myself:\n\nIn case the username doesn't give it away, I'm pretty stereotypical:\n\nEthnicity: Asian\nState: NJ\nCareer: Medicine\nProspective Major: Biochem/Biology\n\nGPA (Estimate): UW - 3.8ish, W-4.03\nRank (Unofficial, school doesn't rank): From what I can tell, I should at least be in the top 5% of my class of 700+. I have no way of knowing exactly where though. Probably top 20, and possibly top 15. I doubt I'm in the the top 10...\n\n***Rigorous GPA System (90%-94%=A-, 95-100%=A, and AP Weighting is +.5/ Honors is +.25) *Here's the bad news: My school is changing the system to make it easier starting my junior year and the new system won't be retroactive. I'm afraid this is going to artificially boost my GPA and discourage adcoms... (New System: A=93%-100%, AP Weighting is +1/ Honors is +.5).\n\nPSAT: Sophomore = 206\nSAT: Scoring Between 2290-2320 in the Blue Book and Between 2200-2270 in Barron's on practice tests (these aren't lowest to highest scores, but rather rough approximations, I've scored higher than 2320 in the Blue Book on occasion)\nSAT IIs: Prepping for Math II (looking for a solid 800). Bio and Chem next May/June\n\nFreshman:\n\n- AP Physics B (A- and 4 on exam; actually the 4 is a shocker b/c I didn't even buy a study book for the exam. I could have easily received a 5 had I put some effort into it)\n- Honors Alg II (B+) = quite literally the worst grade and experience of my life and in no way due to the material (I really do love math)\n- Honors English I (A-)\n- Honors Gov + Economics (A-)\n- Latin I (A)\n- Intro to Computers (A...completely worthless)\n- PE (A)\n\nSophomore:\n\n- Honors Pre-AP Calculus (A-)\n- Honors Biology (A)\n- Honors Chemistry (A-, should have been an A, had a 94% and the school's toughest teacher :()\n- Honors English II (A-)\n- Honors US History (A)\n- Latin II (A)\n- Computer Programming (A)\n- PE (A)\n\nJunior Year Schedule: AP Chemistry, AP Calc BC, AP English III, AP Comp Sci A, Global Studies Honors (required course, otherwise, it would be AP), Honors Latin III\n\nWell, those are as far as my academics go. Now, part of what I need advice with is on how my academic profile (what I've provided above) can be improved upon. I really slacked freshman year and tried a bit harder sophomore year, but still didn't give it all that I could. My problem is I get discouraged easily by a few low grades and that leads me on a downward trend through the year. I'm a lot more serious now and I'm hoping to really give it my all this coming year and come out on top. If I pull out junior year with two A-'s in 2 of the 4 AP courses (which I'm assuming will be in English and perhaps another course) and A's in the rest, I'll end up with a decent 4.17 W GPA. Of course, I'm planning to do better and I have a feeling this will only be a worst-case-scenario. What else can I do? How will the change in GPA systems affect my chances? I'm open to any advice. Should I add on another AP course? I guess I can throw in AP Econ or something in place of Global Studies (and then take that senior year). Am I planning enough SAT IIs or should I have more? Extracurriculars are, of course, another case entirely:\n\nECs:\n\n- Careers in Medicine Club - I joined sophomore year, ran for office (lost), and plan to attend and help coordinate next year and hopefully receive an officer position as a result.\n\n- Science Competitor's Club - I joined sophomore year and will be an officer next year. We basically compete in certain science-related competitions and my plans are to expand the playing field for the coming year.\n\n- NJ Science League - I competed for the school in Chem I. No recognitions other than the fact that I qualified to take the tests in the first place.\n\n- Took AMC last year and scored a few points below the cutoff for AIME. This was with minimal studying so I have a feeling I'll be able to correct it next year.\n\n- I've been involved with JSA since freshman year. I will be Director of Debate next year for my local chapter and a cabinet member for the NJ region as well. I have a few Best Speaker acknowledgements (with hopefully a few more on the way) and I also write for the JSA political newspaper. Overall, JSA is the embodiment of my leadership and communication abilities.\n\n- National Latin Exams and Princeton University Competitions - Silver Medal in the 9th grade and a gold in the 10th on the NLE. I have also competed at Princeton University as a part of a team for the past two years which has received placements (2nd and 4th).\n\n- March of Dimes - I joined the local Youth Chain Reaction Council in my sophomore year and helped organized a fundraiser that raised around $30,000 dollars last year and was recognized nationally for its contribution. Each member also received recognition from Governor Corzine and the NJ State Legislature. I'm assured an officer position by the end of next year.\n\n- Volunteer: Hospital and Senior Center. About 100 hours so far.\n\n- Research in molecular biology at Rutgers University: Working with drosophila melongaster (fruit flies) this summer and currently conducting an experiment with the PR-set7 protein that may have signficance in the rapid division and growth of cancer cells in humans. It's really not as big as it sounds; it's more of the quality of the research report that will determine how interesting it is. I plan to compete next year at the North Jersey Science Fair with this work. By the end of next summer, I hope to have explored the field enough to write Intel STS/Siemen's quality research.\n\n- I also play tennis for fun (and suck) and play the piano (and suck more). Both are just leisurely activities that I don't plan on mentioning on a college app.\n\nOverall, though I think I have been pretty involved in and out of school, I feel like I've been lacking in terms of truly worthy scientific ECs. I hope to correct this by next year and have already started taking action to do so. Not only have I started research but I will also likely be the founder of a club/team at my high school to compete in the New Jersey Science Olympiad. Addtionally, I have already compiled a list of noteworthy scientific competitions and programs that I will look into/compete in next year (foremost among these are the USNCO, USABO, and North Jersey Science Fair (hopefully followed by ISEF)). I want to ask if I'm heading in the right direction if I want to make it to any of the following colleges:\n\n- UPenn\n- JHU\n- Columbia\n- Cornell\n- Duke\n\nMore than likely, I would apply ED to JHU (because I just love what they have to offer and am not so ivy-obsessed as to choose a lesser school in terms of premedical education over it). I don't believe wholeheartedly in Newsweek's college 'rankings', but I am at least in full support of their choice for Best College for PreMeds (JHU). Anyway, I'm willing to take any advice anybody will offer. I need to know now whether or not I'm planning the right path for myself and even whether or not I'm being realistic in my ambitions. But most of all, how much will my results in such science competitions as I plan to participate in matter to my chances at each individual college (especially JHU).

It provides no means of measuring knowledge months after the course, when one may have absorbed the course material better (especially since learning is best done over a period of months, especially as one must review the material in order to learn material on top of that). One could choose research, but you can't really compare one's research with another, and the results of research are highly dependent on chance variables such as the selection of project and that of mentor.\n\nI know that there are the GRE Subject tests, but the level of those subject tests aren't so high. Moreover, I don't want to be accused of being a \"lazy ****\" just because of high GRE scores and low GPA. I do pull numerous all-nighters and spend numerous hours on homework - it's just that my learning style is different from that of others, and as a result, I don't absorb material very well on the first try, but absorb it better through mistakes that I've made (and I tend to be motivated by coursework to pull all-nighters to study - it's harder to do that by purely self-studying). I'm actually less distractible during all-nighters (but it's just the way I tend to operationalize how hard I need to work).\n\nIdeally, I'd like there to be an exam system similar to that of AP exams and SAT II exams (or the systems that some other universities use, that you can pass out of the material). But yet here, you can only take exams by taking more and more courses. Evidently, it's not a good way to demonstrate knowledge because people learn at different rates and some may learn better after reviewing the material over a period of months after the course.\n\nI could try to arrange with a professor to \"re-take\" an exam independently of the course - but that's not going to accomplish anything...

Although I've been trying to find a major and career that I would be interested in by taking classes, talking to people in careers I'm curious about, and doing internships, I still find that I am most (actually, practically exclusively) interested in an art career after college (probably advertising or illustration). As my college is not particularly known for the arts, I am wondering whether I should attempt to transfer to an art school.\n\nThe setbacks I see are these:\n1. I'd probably transfer in as a sophomore or junior (resulting in more than 4 years of school total)\n2. I'd have to pay more for college as a result of the first setback\n3. I'd very likely lose the ability to major in philosophy (I'm a double major right now). My philosophy BA would probably open up more jobs for me (though not jobs in the arts, which is what I'm looking for)\n**Does anyone know if I could transfer into the RISD/Brown 5-year program?\n***Are there any other programs like RISD/Brown out there that I could transfer to (since I'll be continuing college and will transfer when I'm at junior standing at said college)?\n4. Maybe the strong networking at my school can compensate for the lack of connections/opportunities opened up by a school's reputation (though I've noticed that a number of art majors at my school who pursue art careers end up getting a BFA or MFA after their first BA, which makes me think that more education is inevitable, and transferring right now would be more beneficial in the long run)\n\nThe advantages seem to be the following:\n1. More rigorous art program (good for portfolio building as well as my own satisfaction)\n2. Well-known to the companies who fill positions in advertising or illustration (name of art school carries more weight)\n3. More jobs available through company offers and connections\n4. Interaction with other students interested in fine arts (not much of that where I am--it's disappointing)\n5. Following #4, I would not mind transferring from current college (I wouldn't want to leave my friends, but there are other things besides the art program that I'm concerned about or just dislike)\n6. Some of the things I countered in the disadvantages\n\nI know that I'm asking many questions here, but does anyone have comments about any of my questions/thoughts? Has anyone found transferring from a non-arts school to an art school worthwhile?\n\nThanks in advance! :) "}, {"date": "2008-06-28T17:45:21+00:00", "url": "http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/college-admissions/530125-please-give-me-some-advice.html", "messages": "\n                    Hi everyone,\n\nI graduated from a Canadian High School this year (on this thursday), and I got accepted into one of the top 20 American universities. I requested a deferral to that university so that I can take a gap year. I'm planning to do an internship at one of the Government ministries, volunteer and take some courses at local university. But the thing is, until I actually applied and got accepted to this university, I didn't have any interest or affinity towards this university. Also, the university I got accepted into wouldn't let me take any courses during my gap year. I'm not sure if I would be very happy attending this university, and I'm thinking of reapplying to several universities including some of the ones that I applied last year.\n\nI was enrolled in IB program, and the results are coming out soon. I got predicted overall score of 41 when I was applying, and my Ontario grade was only around 93%. However, after the results come out in early July and my Ontario grades are translated, my grade 12 average will be around 99%. I'm confident that i got at least 43 out of 45 IB score.\nMy SAT 1 score wasn't very good (only 2050), and I'm confident I will be able to increase the score to ~2300.\nAlso, when I was applying last year, my citizenship was South Korea, but if I reapply this year, it will be Canada.\n\nThe only thing that I'm concerned with is that in order to reapply to other universities, I have to decline the offer of admission from this university. My parents are worried that i might end up going to a university of lower caliber.\nSo, guys, please provide me with some insight regarding what should I do.\nI'm really confused...

Though sometimes the decisions we make are yielding positive results, most of the time we have to be responsible for our \"bad\" decisions. This notion is exemplified by examples from my person anecdote and Nathaniel Hawthorne's \"Scarlet Letter\".\n\n==   It was a sunny day as I recall, I actually made into the school's varsity basketball team. To be on such \"prestiguous\" team means a lot to me, for I can pursue my athletic dreams. However, the training in the varsity team was like an alien reading English, it was difficult. I couldn't handle it; I never thought I'd be making a decision against my will, despite my interests. Two weeks later, could not bear any longer, I told my coach, \"I quit.\" This is indeed a decision I regret, but it's my decision, I'm responsible for it, therefore, I accept this harsh reality.\n\n== Another compelling example serves to back up my argument is Nathaniel Hawthorne's novel \"The Scarlet Letter\". Hester Prynne, a woman living in a puritanical society, commited adulteration(ops used wrong word, should be adultery lol), which was regarded, in the Puritan's views, as a shameful crime. Hester Prynne, along with her secret lover, Dimmesdale, made their decision of breaking the society's regulations. As a result, both of them face the cruel punishment, though Dimmesdale was tortured spiritually. Hester Prynne decided to lessn her sins by helping the society to become a better place. She, at last, was forgiven, with the Letter \"A\" standing for \"Able\" instead of \"Adultery\".\n\n==   We have absolute liberty to make decisions on our own, though we might regret for making such decision later on.

But he also didn\u0092t go in depth, like he would on the days to come, instead, he told us a lot of concepts and ideas that he would eventually dissect further.  He talked, first, about how we\u0092re all wearing a lens, about how we have no other reference except our own experience, emotions are our own interpretation.  He told us that by putting ourselves in the position of victim in our lives was a strategy of justification at why we were failing, and that we would end up struggling with it for our lives.  He told us that our society was based on capitalism, and that how productive we were actually wasn\u0092t a basis of identity, society wants us to be productive and consume.  I knew within five minutes that this would be my favorite class in all of my years at Berkeley High.\nLearning about the western principles of psychology and hearing all of this from a man who has traveled the world and knows much more than I do has been an experience that arises awe within me.  I am fascinated because once I learn the basis of things like relationships and happiness, I want to apply everything I learn to my own life.  It\u0092s an exhausting process, to really sit and listen wholly for an hour and really understand all that he is saying, and then, to sit and think about my own life and see where it\u0092s lacking something, or what is causing me to be unhappy, and try and fix it. I\u0092ve learned that it\u0092s important to look at cause and effect, to look directly at the relationship between what is being done and what the result is, what the product is.  Once you have mastered cause and effect, you can obtain the result you want, and the one that will make you happiest. He told us that when science can\u0092t explain cause and effect its because of change. We, as humans, have a constant drive towards pleasure and away from pain.  We learned by reading plato that man loves the good, and that which creates happiness, and man loves the possession of the good, especially when its everlasting, for instance, eros.\nThe class has inspired me more than I had anticipated, has changed me, has caused me a lot of internal confusion, but more than anything, the class has taught me.  It makes me want to know everything there is to know about theoretical psychology, and philosophy like the back of my hand.  In fact, in that first week, we also learned about how Plato said that one should really master one subject, how they should become profound in something so that from this profundity we can understand what profundity is, and once you see the profundity in one thing, you can see it in everything. Then, you could see beauty in everything, all the time, every minute.  This seems to be something worthwhile, at least for me. I want to reinvent my thinking, and read a book by a philosopher and apply it to my life and change who I am.  I want to grow as a person and become the best that I can be and improve and change and thrive.

I live in California, so that gives me an extra day or so right? I plan to turn mine in the morning. My friends are turning it tomorrow also. I'm scared because everyone on this forum says turn it in today.\n\nAnyway, can someone check my first prompt personal statement?\n\nPrompt #1 (freshman applicants)\nDescribe the world you come from \u0097 for example, your family, community or school \u0097 and tell us how your world has shaped your dreams and aspirations.\n\nSome say video games turned into a bad influence upon children\u0092s minds. Others believe that the root of violence within adolescents originated from video games. Video game opposition suggests it creates poor students academically.\nBut never have I, as a proud gamer, succumb to anything lower than a B. I grew up in this reverie, one that no book could ever create. Amongst the boring reality I live in, I loved the airships, the foreign or extraterrestrial characters, and the beauty of the land that each game made. I conquered terrorists, defeated dragons, saved a village, and conquered evil. In it, I felt a fulfilling purpose that no adult could ever bestow on me.\nThe gore and violence didn\u0092t attract me, but the overall feeling. As I played, I gained a fulfillment actuality never provided. I felt the feeling of victory within me. As I learned success\u0092 taste, I began to expand my hands towards a new field: academics. Believing in the knowledge I can learn, I studied rigorously, hoping to gain the mathematical and logical skills to become a computer programmer. Because of my ambition, my parents never saw harm in video games. However, at the same time, my parents could never help me. Feeling I could do things on my own, they thought outside help from them or friends appeared idiotic and unnecessary in their eyes. \u0093It\u0092s your life, you should figure it out yourself,\u0094 my Dad would say. Throughout my childhood to this day, I try to find all moral answers within video games. At other times, I\u0092d just play in order to relieve myself from stress that the real world puts upon my shoulders. Whether the stress results from school\u0092s English homework or parental lectures, I found my source of escapism from playing. As I let the soothing audio and colorful images take me away, I returned to my calm, collective self. I found video games to as a faithful companion.\nI learned the morals, hidden away or at the end of each game. Love conquers all, never admit defeat, learn from mistakes \u0096 common lessons that reality seldom teaches. In reality, people laugh at my academic mistakes, resulting in misguidance towards a solution. I could never look towards my parents for their teachings. Always straightforward, they could not accept academic mistakes. Turning to video games, I found all the inspiration I need. Living within the multiple countries and worlds, I hoped to create my own, one that combines a multitude of genres, capturing the hearts of every, particular gamer. Shooting, racing, and role-playing, I shall create one that incorporates the adulation of every gamer. Hopefully, it shall turn into a world that can defeat all video game controversies.\n\n\nThe word count is 452. I need help shortening it to 400-410.

Thi sdoes not include the other dedicated UW support foundations of WARF and the UW System.  WARF may have been more aggressive and taken more losses but that's just my guess.  WARF had about $2 Billion while the UW System held anout $400 Million for Madison at the beginning of the year.\n\n\n\"The end of the year is the perfect time to reflect on the past and look forward to new challenges that lie ahead. It's a good time to review our decisions and performance, both good and bad, and to use this wisdom to capture new opportunities. As we look at our financial stewardship, we'd like to share our thoughts, decisions and financial performance with you. Our success is not achieved in a vacuum. It's only accomplished through the remarkable relationship we have with you. Therefore, as your partner, we want to bring you up to date on this year and offer a glimpse into the coming year.\n\nIt goes without saying that 2008 has been a challenging year. What started as a subprime mortgage and housing problem in 2007 grew into a global financial and economic crisis by mid-2008. This crisis affects all areas of our financial lives. Stock portfolios have declined nearly in half, home values have decreased, access to credit is becoming more and more limited and there is much concern over job security. And now, according to the National Bureau of Economic Research, it's official. We have been in an economic recession since December 2007.\n\nMaking the news almost daily is the fate of non-profit entities such as endowments and foundations. There have been a number of stories of university endowments that are seeing their portfolios decline precipitously and who are struggling to provide liquidity to meet their commitments. While we've not been immune to similar events over the last year, we do have good news. We are a careful steward of your gifts and for that reason want to dispel any concerns you may have regarding the performance of the Foundation's portfolios, our exposure to toxic investments, our ability to meet our commitments or raise funds and the stability of the organization.\n\nPortfolio Performance\nThrough the end of October, the stock market, as measured by the S&P 500 index, declined more than 32 percent year-to-date. This is not the first time we've seen this happen. Other stock market tumbles have included the technology bubble burst of 2000-2002, the Long Term Capital debacle of 1998 and Black Monday in 1987, all of which experienced similar declines. This current cycle has been so difficult because of the extremely negative performance of less risky asset classes such as investment grade bonds, mortgages and even cash instruments. November and December provided no relief and, as of December 2, the S&P 500 index had declined more than 43 percent year-to-date.\n\nThe UW Foundation manages two portfolios that contain gifts for the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Short-term gifts\u2014or expendable funds\u2014that support near-term expenditures (such as a building project) have been invested similarly to a money market fund. These gifts are safe and earning a competitive interest rate. Long-term gifts\u2014or endowments\u2014for scholarships, professorships and other similar purposes are invested in our endowment portfolio.\n\nThe goal of the Foundation's $1.5 billion endowment portfolio is to achieve a total return of roughly 10 percent per year over a market cycle to meet our spending needs, keep pace with inflation and cover management expenses. At the end of 2007, the endowment portfolio had grown 15 percent on average over the last five years, well above our targeted goals. This year, from January through October 31, the endowment has declined approximately 20 percent. Although we are not pleased with this result, we are encouraged to have saved a significant amount of value when compared to the stock market and many other equity-related portfolios.\n\nExposure to \"Toxic\" Investments\nRecently, there have been a number of reports in the media describing how various institutions have faced significant troubles in certain investment strategies. They can generally be categorized as high-risk derivatives strategies, highly leveraged strategies and overexposure to illiquid asset classes. None of these strategies are harmful by definition, but problems have occurred when some institutions realized that the exposure to these strategies was greater than originally planned. Today, many derivatives strategies have been wiped out, leverage (essentially borrowing money to invest) is being paid down and institutions are attempting to sell their illiquid assets at fire sale prices.\n\nThe endowment portfolio is exposed to a number of these strategies, but in a manageable way. In fact, the philosophy of the endowment portfolio over the last two years has been to reduce risk in the portfolio, raise our level of cash and opportunistically invest in assets at depressed prices. Derivatives vehicles have been used, but used successfully to hedge our exposure to credit markets rather than enhance our returns. The Foundation has never used leverage at the portfolio level. By managing our exposure to illiquid asset classes, we are not a forced seller of our assets, but actually are in a position to be an opportunistic buyer.\n\nMeeting Our Commitments\nThrough your gifts and investment in the University, the Foundation is able to support students and faculty in many ways. For our short-term portfolio, dollars are available for purposes for which they are intended. For endowment gifts, the Foundation's Board of Directors has determined a spending plan that approximates 4.75 percent per year (paid quarterly). However, rather than simply spend 4.75 percent each and every year, the spending plan averages the endowment's value over the previous 12 quarters and spends 4.75 percent of this averaged amount. The effect of this plan is to spend a little less in good times and spend a little more in bad times on a percentage basis. In 2009, this plan will not be affected. The end result will be that the spending dollars will decline as the endowment declines in value, but at a much slower pace. This smoothing effect should assist the University as it plans for the upcoming year. However, we are ensuring our campus partners are aware of the current environment to allow them to plan appropriately for what may well be a lower level of support in the near future.\n\nRaising Funds for the University\nAlthough much of this letter is devoted to the subject of our investments, we want to emphasize that our main goal is to find those opportunities on campus that meet your passions. This is accomplished not only by monetary gifts, but by the time and expertise you so generously share. In the past during difficult periods, Badgers have consistently come through for their university. This can be seen during 2000-2002, when our ability to raise support continued at a record pace. However, we fully expect that 2009 will be a very difficult year. We are seeing the number of donors decline on a year-over-year basis, and the number of appreciated stock gifts is understandably down.\n\nThat said, knowing us as you do, you will not be surprised to hear that we continue to be excited about the future. The Wisconsin Idea does not pause during difficult times. We plan to continue our conversations with you, to find opportunities for your involvement and to help you discover new passions at the University. We know that many will continue to provide support for students. These times magnify the need for scholarship support. However, we understand that this may be a year that will be difficult for many to make a gift. With that in mind, we'd like to engage you in a campaign of ideas and in building relationships that will be realized when good times return. Please continue to share your ideas, your passions and your time with us as we reach out to you in the near future.\n\nThe UW Foundation\nWe hope this report has given you a new level of comfort in the stability of the UW Foundation. Although the investment markets affect us, our strategies have saved a significant amount of value, our commitments are in place and our purpose to support the University remains unchanged. We continue to evaluate our processes to determine where we can reduce expenses and become more efficient. We are grateful that reducing staff or limiting our ability to meet with you is not something we must entertain at the present time.\n\nAs a separate organization from the University, we cannot speculate on the near-term future of the University. However, it's probable that all revenue sources for the University will be stressed, including private support, state funding and the reduced ability to raise tuition. The University is currently looking across all areas for ways to reduce spending. Against that challenging backdrop, we are pleased to state that the UW Foundation is on solid ground and prepared to move forward with our mission to advance the University. We look forward to continuing our partnership with you in 2009                "}, {"date": "2008-12-17T22:34:09+00:00", "url": "http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/college-search-selection/618381-good-safety-schools-for-math-econ.html", "messages": "\n                    This is my situation, just got deferred from MIT early action, got a lot of applications to get done.

Didn't everyone use to stress out so much about these things in the years past? What happened to that whole thing?\n\nI understand that the SAT is becoming less fair and more subjective, favoring the people who buy prep books by the dozen and study for months at a time and take tons of classes. As an aptitude test, it seems only fair to me that everyone only study maybe one or two books to get familiar with the layout (so no one is at a disadvantage in terms of time limits and comfortability with the format). SAT prep classes are ridiculous, I think. I do see how having a plethora of books available is good because it gives everyone a chance, but anything beyond that would seem to skew the results, I'd imagine.\n\nColleges seem to be especially wary of this during the ED rounds this year, and while I am aware Harvard doesn't have an early program, I think many students will get in with 1900's without a lot of outstanding hooks. Maybe I'm just being bitter.\n\nSorry, I know this must sound like a rant. I actually agree with top schools' idea to weight the SAT less; it's just that this seems to have resulted in a heavier favorability towards the GPA and class rank, which are subjective and circumstantial by nature, which is sort of the reason why a standardized testing system was implemented in the first place.

Son #2 is now a HS junior.  A bright kid.  He is good at taking standardized tests.  He just received his SAT scores from the early December test date, and did very well, but not, I suppose you could say, spectacularly (mid 2200s).  He also recently received his PSAT score, far above our state's historical score numbers for NMSF qualification. He also took the ACT last year as a sophomore, and received a near perfect score.  (His essay scores for both the ACT and SAT were excellent, also.)  His prep for these tests was simply to run through the online sample test/questions a day or two beforehand (his parents' encouragement to do a little more notwithstanding).  He's also a very good, diligent student on pace to finish very high in his class, taking the hardest course load he can.  His ECs are solid if unspectacular, but honest.  (He's not a resume padder.)\n\nThe question is simple:  Is there any good reason for him to take either the ACT or (more particularly) the SAT again?  With additional maturity and classroom learning (and perhaps some more diligent test prep) I could see him \"improving\" his SAT score.  But are we already at the point of diminishing returns?\n\nObviously you need the context of where he's considering attending school.  (The flip answer is nowhere.  I don't mean he's not intending to go to college, I mean he's just not very interested in thinking about it yet.  The mail piles up on the desk.  Nor does he have any certainty about what he wants to do, although he has mentioned computer science and foreign languages.)  His current \"measurables\" already assure him of admittance to our state flagship, a \"public ivy,\" and probably make him competitive at any top public.  And there's as good a chance as any he will simply decide to go to the state flagship, as it's a great University with strong programs in his current fields of interest.  But, despite the risk to my financial sanity, I don't want him to close the door just yet to the selective private universities.  (Nor am I closing the door to LACs, although he seems more like a University kid, unlike his older brother, who is at a good LAC right now.)\n\nSo, that said, let's assume he decides to apply to selective private universities, e.g. MIT, CM, Rice, maybe an Ivy.  Throw in a Swarthmore or Carleton.  Do these schools honestly care if a kid has a 2260 or a 2340?  Especially if his other measurables are all very good, too?  At that point, won't a good essay or a nice EC presentation matter more to an admissions officer?  My rational side wants to believe that every college admissions officer knows that the difference between a kid scoring in the 99th or the 99 1/2 percentile on a standardized test is which side of bed he got up on that morning or how much his stomach was grumbling during the exam.  It also seems to me that an admissions officer might take into account that my son obtained his scores before he was halfway through his junior year, and might naturally assume he would have improved them if he had decided to take them again.\n\nOr am I being naive?  The irrational or anxious side of me wonders whether the admissions officers will wonder why he didn't take the tests again at the end of his junior year or during his senior year, or worse, in the new era of score selection or whatever it's called, wonder whether he did so and didn't report them because he did less well.\n\nAnd a related question; should he report only his ACT score?  It has the advantage of being even better than his SAT score, but the disadvantage of having been taken when he was a high school sophomore, so if that's all he reports there will be even a longer period of time on his resume about which the admissions officer might wonder \"where did he go from there?\"  To me, the SAT result, if not quite at the level of his ACT result, is such that it should confirm the earlier score, not put it into doubt.  So says my rational side, anyway.  So why not report both?  And I assume he'll take some SAT subject tests.  Will reporting those scores also carry along the SAT score, making the question moot?\n\nMy son would of course rather not take these tests again.  He finds them a bothersome way to spend a Saturday morning.  I'm inclined to agree with him.  But then I look at the shockingly low admissions rates at the most selective schools (naturally) and wonder again whether that last 20 or 50 or 100 points on a standardized test might actually make a difference.   I hope not, but I don't know.\n\nI apologize if this sounds boastful, as I don't mean it that way.  I simply don't think I can get the answers I'm looking for if I don't put the data out there.  Now seems like the right time to ask, because he could still sign up for the tests again later this year and because whether he likes it or not we'll soon have to start getting a little more serious about where he might decide to apply to, and that in turn will require some advance planning for spring and summer visits.\n\nAll input welcome.

Overall, it is MUCH STRONGER now than  it was in the late 90s. Here are some points about the \"OLD\" Chicago:\n\n- For the Class of 2000, the U of C was admitting more than 60% of its applicants, the school lagged behind its peers in minority enrollment, and only around 900 students graduated in this class (the graduating classes at Chicago today are about 35% bigger).\n\n- While Chicago prided itself on being \"self-selective,\" even with a lacking applicant pool, only about 29% of the accepted students actually came.\n\n- Chicago had the lowest graduation rate among the leading private universities (about 1 in 5 did not finish)\n\n- The Endowment stood at a modest $2 billion. At the time, this was about a sixth the size of Yale's endowment.\n\n- While undergrads always talked about receiving the best education in the land, the school dropped to around #14 or #15 in the US News Rankings. While sure, the rankings are flawed, at a school that lacked the Ivy League brand or recognition for top-flight sports and academics (read: Stanford or Duke), this drop behind schools such as Wash U. certainly didn't help the already flagging morale.\n\n- As recently as 6 years ago, there was a crumbling gym, and the undergraduate community lacked the centralization seen today because the Palevsky dorms were just starting, and Shoreland still held an extremely high number of undergraduates.\n\nThis is why, when students ask about stereotypes at Chicago, prospective applicants NEED TO KNOW how much Chicago has changed in such a short span of time (at least in the world of higher education). I graduated about 8 years ago, when, frankly, Chicago was an institution very much hanging in the balance. Now, as the school has righted itself, regained solid financial footing, and modulated some of its institutional interests, I think it's appropriate to address the stereotypes with a historical framework in mind. Here goes...\n\n1.) \"Where Fun Comes to Die\"\n\nThen (circa 1998): What do you think happens when you take a class with some academic superstars, but also featured a lot of inquisitive but lackluster students, and present them with the challenge of America's most rigorous liberal arts curriculum? Students studied a lot, they studied hard, and MANY were in completely over their heads. Couple that with a school that prided itself on its rigor, lacked grade inflation, and provided little administrative support for students, and what's the result? Add to all of this a generally disjointed student body - one that featured a solid proportion of quirky, studious types, but also featured a lot of Columbia or Stanford wanna bes that clearly used Chicago as a safety school and wanted to be elsewhere.\n\nAs seen here, student morale in the late 90s was not - to put it lightly - at an all time high. Fun might not have been dying during the waning days of the Clinton administration, but it was on life support.\n\nNow: I'd like current students to fill in the blanks here, but I'd imagine the school - especially with the most recent classes - is a markedly different place. While I think Chicago has done a good job of keeping its \"soul\" (read: recruiting intellectually curious, studious, and quirky students and presenting them with a faculty and course offerings that rivals anything offered anywhere), the College's institutional character is MARKEDLY different. With an accept rate of about 25%, a yield rate of about 40% (without even using yield-boosting early decision), more students hailing from the top 10% of their HS class (around 90%, as opposed to maybe 70% in the late 90s), and, at least for the past four years or so (enough time to become part of the collegian's memory), a #9 or #8 finish in US News, I would imagine that morale is MUCH HIGHER.\n\nHigher morale, coupled with a more cohesive AND capable class, and a better undergrad scene (world-class gym right on campus, buzz around Obama, Shoreland closing and the campus becoming more centralized) leads me to think that Chicago students are MUCH better equipped to deal with the rigors of the curriculum, and have more resources at their disposal for socializing  or enjoying their time at the U of C. While I can't comment on whether fun is finally off life support and thriving, I think it's safe to say that the phrase: \"The U of C: Where Contentment Comes to Roost.\" could hold water.\n\nWhen I was at the U of C, there were certainly students who were deeply dissatisfied and embittered by their time at Chicago. In short, they were in over their heads, and they were resentful. I don't think that's the case at Chicago any more.\n\n\n2.) Grade \"Deflation\" Kills\n\nTHEN: Rumor was, for the class of 1996 or 1997, the average GPA was around a 2.9 or 3.0. Sure, you had the academic superstars going on to MD/PhD programs at Harvard and winning Rhodes Scholarships (there were 3 my year), but lots of kids just could not hack it when faced with a faculty that first, believed in enforcing the fabled Chicago rigor and, second, generally had exposure to the higher overall level of academic talent found at Harvard, Yale, MIT, etc. Yes, Chicago students struggled.\n\nNOW: I think this needs to be empasized: I believe that now, CHICAGO DOES NOT HAVE GRADE \"DEFLATION\". Do they do this to the extent of a Brown or Dartmouth? (See my previous threads for links to the rampant grade inflation at these schools.) NO. Everyone is not getting As, and 90% of the U of C student body is not graduating with honors. At the same time, as seen above, my sense is that grades have crept up as the incoming classes have increased in strength, and now, again, students are more content with the result of their labor at Chicago. While 8 years ago, the average GPA might have been around a 3.0, now, I'd imagine it's around a 3.3-3.4 (behind the 3.5 or so average at Chicago's peer schools, but not by much at all).\n\n\n3.) Chicago Kills your chances at Professional Grad Schools\n\nTHEN: Remember those inquisitive but in-over-their-heads students I talked about at the beginning of this missive? Take that group, put them in an environment that disdains anything pre-professional, and does not provide them with many administrative resources that offer a sophisticated slant on the admissions process at top prof grad schools, and what do you think happens? When the Chicago kid \"majoring\" in \"Big Problems\" decides that he needs to do something after graduation, take a guess at where his 3.1 GPA and hurriedly earned 161 LSAT score will get him? Or take the Chicago student with a low 1300s SAT score who struggles mightily to earn Bs in the science courses, and then earns a 30 on the MCAT. The student already is a bit quirky and doesn't interview all that well, so what happens to her when she goes through the med school admissions game? Johns Hopkins might not be banging on her door.\n\nIn the late 90s/early 2000s, most other schools were on board with a decidedly more pre-professional student body. As opposed to even a couple decades ago, humanities majors begin thinking about law school by the end of their freshman years of college (or even before). Chicago was behind the curve on this front.\n\nNOW: Chicago students, as a group, are more talented now. They do better on standardized tests (the SAT avg. at Chicago when I was there was maybe in the mid-high 1300s or so - very good, but well behind the 1450-1460 pace set by the newest classes), are more equipped to deal with Chicago's academic requirements, and, true to the times, are probably at least a bit more pre-professional than my cohort 8 years ago. I would imagine current Chicago students fare MUCH BETTER in the professional grad school admissions process.\n\nQuick note here: unalove or uchicago12 or any other current chicago students: could one of you perhaps meet with the Chicago pre-law advisor in Ida Noyes and ask to see Chicago applicant Data? We NEED some hard facts here, and I'd be interested in seeing Chicago's MOST RECENT performance. (I'm especially interested in seeing how the Class of 2012 and 2013 will do in the years ahead, because they outpace my peers by a considerable degree.)\n\nAs a point of reference, around 2000, I think the avg. GPA for Chicago students applying to law school was around 3.3 or so, and the avg. LSAT was about a 161. I would expect these numbers to be higher. Also, placement at top schools lagged a bit: maybe 3 to Harvard, 2-3 to Columbia, 2-3 to NYU, maybe 2-3 to UPenn and Duke, maybe 4-5 to Northwestern, etc. Put that in comparison to the numbers at Penn and Yale...\n\nPenn: Career Services, University of Pennsylvania\n\nYale: http://www.yale.edu/career/students/gradprof/lawschool/media/lawstats.pdf\n\nOne more time - NOW, I would imagine the numbers would be BETTERt, and will CONTINUE TO IMPROVE with each exiting class. I would expect the class of 2011 or 2012 to send 6-7 each to Harvard, Columbia, etc. Then, maybe 4-5 to UPenn, Duke, etc.\n\nAgain, if someone can go to Ida Noyes Hall and take a quick look at the data, that would be VERY helpful to our discussion. We need some hard numbers here. Here's the address and contact info for Chicago's pre-law advisor:\n\nThe University of Chicago Graduate & Professional Studies Program\n\nFinally, this missive should recharge the discussion a bit, but also serves as a reminder that Chicago, unlike most of its peers, has overseen tremendous change over a very short period of time. Hearing about the experiences of even recent alums may not correspond to what awaits prospective students in the near future.\n\nI think, through all this, Chicago has done a good job of keeping its classic institutional character. The U of C now is probably not swarming with the politicos found at Georgetown or the narrowly striving pre-professionals found at UPenn. Chicago still boasts a more erudite, academic feel than its immediate peers, but I feel that - through SIGNIFICANT administrative endeavors - the U of C has really modulated its institutional interests to fit the times better. As Kirp states in his book, given the rampant change at Chicago, the administration and controversial ex-presidents from my era \"may have saved an institution by dragging it into modern times.\"\n\nWhen I was at Chicago, these proposed changes (revamping the core, building a sparkling new gym, increasing the class size) was met with considerable venom from students and faculty. Now, 8 years later, most of these changes have come to pass, and they have changed the University in indelible ways. Students are more capable, probably more socially well-adjusted, more content, and surrounded by more varied and better resources. At the same time, Chicago has kept its committment to serious thought and inquiry alive, at all levels of the University. All I can think of through this is the famous oft-used phrase of ascension: \"The King is Dead. Long Live the King!\"                "}, {"date": "2009-01-13T17:06:34+00:00", "url": "http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/graduate-school/636162-bs-ms-4-1-program-in-mathematics-and-mathematicla-sciences.html", "messages": "\n                    First please allow me to summarize myself as briefly as possible:\n\nI am a math major and I currently have a 4.0 GPA in math classes and a 3.83 general GPA. I came to college with 27 transfer credits from High School as a result of AP/IB classes. As a result, I could see myself graduating in 3 years without any problem. I posed the question here in CC and everyone told me that staying a fourth year would be best since it would strengthen my application as well as give me a more broad background on mathematics before going to grad school.\n\nI analyzed this and it made sense so I decided to stay one more year and in that last year I was planning on taking grad level classes.\n\nHowever, I was discussing this with a friend and he told me that since im going to be done with the BS required courses in 3 years and then on the 4th I was going to take grad level classes, why not get into the BS+MS 4+1 program that my university offers. (BS in Mathematics and MS in Mathematical Sciences). Also, given my transfer credits from AP/IB classes this program will reduce to actually be a 3+1 program in which in 4 years I will receive a BS and MS.\n\nI got a couple questions:\n\nMy ultimate plan is to go to grad school to do a phd in pure math. Does the fact that the MS is in math sciences hurt me in any way? Most people go the BS -> phd route so I dont see how a MS can hurt in any way but im just asking.\n\nIs there any drawback to this kinds of BS+MS programs that I may not be aware of?\n\nWhat is your opinion on my situation specifically?\n\nI would really appreciate any input in this issue!\n\nThanks.

Full text follows;\n\n\nIn recent years we have chosen to schedule this event during our annual Mission Week, a thing very fitting indeed.  Indeed, the theme for this year\u0092s Mission Week finds its inspiration in a quotation from the founder of the Jesuits, St. Ignatius of Loyola:  \u0093Love is found more in deeds than in words.\u0094  In terms of Marquette, that truth is confirmed day in and day out through the high-quality work that you and your colleagues accomplish for this university, for our students and for advancing the knowledge and well-being of our human family. The successes we celebrate as a university community would not be possible without the contributions of every member of our university community. For that I most certainly thank you.\n\nWhat is uppermost in our minds at present is, I strongly suspect, the severe economic downturn that we are experiencing and how it is impacting our university.  So I thought it would be important to speak candidly and directly with you about that, and then to do my best at the end of this presentation to answer any questions you have.\n\nWhat would I say generally?  That at present we are as a university weathering the storm and doing decently well.  While no one knows how long this recession will last, it already has had a worldwide impact, and most of the knowledgeable people we have consulted think things really will not turn around until 2010 at the earliest.  Many also believe the economy will get worse before it gets better but no one really knows.\n\nSince so much of our annual revenue derives from tuition, you will be pleased to learn that we have received as of today 17,536 applications for next fall\u0092s freshman class, a remarkable increase of 17% over last year\u0092s record breaking numbers. True enough, more students are sending out multiple applications as a bargain-hunting strategy to find out which university will offer the best financial aid.  However, many universities, even some quite excellent institutions, have had a downturn in applications, and I know of none, certainly none of the Jesuit schools, that have had such a strong percentage increase as we have had.  Last year, with a pool of 15,000 applications from which to choose, we decided that without sacrificing academic quality \u0096 in the end it actually improved \u0096 we could increase the size of our freshman class from about 1,800 to over 1,900, and we are aiming at a similar-sized freshman class this coming fall.  To put it another way, given our present economic situation, the greater downside risk lies with too few students rather than too many.  With more than 80% of our operating budget coming from tuition, room and board, and fees, you can well understand the negative impact any significant decline in enrollment would have on operations.  We could of course be unpleasantly surprised come fall, especially if the economy really tanks in the next few months, but we think on this front we are in quite good shape.\n\nIn terms of our overall finances we have been very much helped by careful planning by our academic and administrative colleagues and capable oversight by our Board of Trustees. That is why, for example, in next year\u0092s budget we felt comfortable in including a salary increase of approximately 3% to be allocated, as always, on a merit basis, and why, unlike a variety of other institutions, we have not felt the need to freeze salaries or hiring.  To be sure, we will be very careful about hiring additional people, we will look closely at vacant positions to see if they really need to be filled and we will be aggressive in looking for further ways to save money \u0096 all of these practices being standard operating procedure in any case.  Ten years ago during a much more dire time for the university, we formed the Renewal Task Force, and that group over time has come up with over $10 million in permanent savings. Dr. Toby Peters, who now leads this group, has been re-energizing its efforts because we should always aim at operating better and more efficiently, and in this economic climate we owe this all the more both to our students and their families and to all of you.  If you have suggestions regarding this, the RTF group would be most grateful for your input.\n\nMore generally I can report that Marquette\u0092s balance sheet is sound, our public credit rating (A2 from Moody\u0092s) is strong, our cash reserves sufficient and fully available, we will again this year operate in the black, and our endowment, while down certainly from where it was back in June (down, that is, about 25%), is diversified, well managed and performing ahead of benchmarks.  And while I would very much like our endowment to be larger, if it were, in terms of budget we would be a lot more dependent on it than we are now.  (I\u0092d still take larger, though \u0096 and I am sure the day will come.)\n\nWe\u0092ve all seen reports about colleges and universities around the country reducing staff and eliminating programs to cut costs, and, thank God, that is not the case here at Marquette.  But, as you well know, these are very difficult times,  and while we will do everything we can going forward to keep the university in good financial shape, it would be plain irresponsible not to do contingency planning to deal with possible negative \u0093what if\u0094 situations that may arise.\n\nOne thing that must have high priority for us as a university is to do whatever we responsibly can to assist students under financial duress from the present downturn to stay in school and complete their degrees. That is simply in keeping with our mission, with who we are as a university.\n\nIn light of that priority our Board of Trustees approved in December the lowest tuition increase in 30 years \u0097 3.5% \u0097 an increase that will add less than $1,000 to an undergraduate student\u0092s tuition bill.  Even with that increase, our tuition continues to be lower than that of most of our peer private universities, lower than that charged by 18 of the nation\u0092s 28 Jesuit colleges and universities. Still, a tuition bill \u0097 even with the financial aid provided to nearly 90% of our undergraduates \u0097 is no incidental expense. Our families make a tremendous sacrifice to send their students here and they do so because they not only seek a good academic and professional education for their children but also the mission-based educational experience that characterizes Marquette:  accessible faculty who are interested in their students\u0092 progress, a supportive campus environment, opportunities for undergraduates to get involved in hands-on research and clinical experiences, an education with a core of studies that embraces the liberal arts, especially philosophy and theology; an overall educational approach that seeks to form men and women for others.  This is Mission Week, and its theme centers on helping us to draw more deeply on our own spirituality and faith to influence all the more our actions for good and to drive the ethic of human excellence and service that is so characteristic of this university.  And, frankly, in times like these, it is, I truly believe, even more important that we do all we can to live out in our work the values that characterize this university and that draw so many families seriously to consider entrusting their son or daughter to us for their college education.\n\nPeople do not easily give up on the dream they have for their children to go to college.  Even in tough times such as we are now experiencing, the intensity of their hopes for their children doesn\u0092t diminish \u0097 it intensifies. They don\u0092t look at college tuition costs and say, \u0093Oh, let\u0092s push that off for a year or two.\u0094 We know the decisions families make now are based on ensuring that their children and grandchildren have better opportunities and more fulfilling lives. We know Marquette offers many special advantages to the parents and students who seek a Catholic, Jesuit university education. And our graduates, as they themselves report, leave us not just well prepared as professionals but also rightfully believing that they have a larger purpose in life and the ability to make a genuine positive difference in our human family. That\u0092s an incredible graduation present!\n\nUnder the assumption that as our families wrestle these days with their household budgets, more of them will need help, we have moved an additional $4 million into the financial aid pipeline. While we do not have the resources to solve every problem, we will in these hard times dedicate resources as best we can to keep pace with such needs as they arise, especially for our current students. In that regard, please keep an eye out for any of your students who may be running into financial problems.  A call or e-mail to our Office of Student Financial Aid will allow their staff quietly to check to see if any significant financial problems have arisen. Last year we announced scholarship aid as our top fundraising priority and this year we are particularly focusing upon current-use scholarships that can go directly to students. Several donors have chosen to provide the university with very generous emergency scholarship support, and this is helping us to retain students suddenly coming under financial distress.  One donation for this purpose that I am especially aware of, a gift of $250,000 from one of our long-time donors, has provided extra financial aid to no less than 51 of our students to help them to stay in school.\n\nTo no one\u0092s surprise, our fundraising results have slowed considerably.  Most people these days are reluctant to make large multi-year gift pledges, i.e., the gifts that typically fuel our campaigns, because they are uncertain and nervous about the future and do not want to over-commit their financial resources.  Still, there is lots of enthusiasm and good will among our donors and friends, many of them are quite willingly making smaller gifts in support of our ongoing operations, and we continue to stay connected with them and wait for better times.\n\nYou might wonder about our building projects.  Two new buildings are currently underway: the new Law School, Eckstein Hall, which is being built on Tory Hill and Zilber Hall, our new student services and administration building, at 12th and Wisconsin.  About $66 million of the $85 million price tag for the Law School has been raised, another $4 million is within sight, and we anticipate that all of the dollars needed for this project will ultimately come from external sources.  The much more modest cost of Zilber Hall is being covered primarily by low interest, thirty-year bonds.  For both of these projects bridge funding has been secured through tax-exempt bonds. In addition, the conversion of the large apartment building on the northeast corner of 17th and Wisconsin into a new residence hall for sophomores is going forward, with its opening date scheduled for next August.  As for the proposed new College of Engineering facility, while a significant percentage of its total cost has already been pledged, we will proceed very cautiously and not start construction until we know very clearly where all the funds are coming from.\n\nSo that gives you a sense of where Marquette University stands amid all the vicissitudes of this economic recession swirling around us.  My own sense of things:  as a university we have struggled with worse difficulties in the past, and we can and we will deal with this challenge as well.\n\nEven recognizing the unsettled future, the present academic year here at Marquette is shaping up as a good one. Let me highlight just a few reasons:\n\nMarquette rose in the U.S. News rankings of the nation\u0092s top 100 universities to No. 77 (up from No. 82), and Kiplinger\u0092s in its annual ranking of \u0093Best Values in Private Colleges\u0094 placed Marquette in 44th place among the Top 50 private universities.\n\nThere is good news in the area of research, grants and technology transfer.  A handheld biodiesel analyzer developed by Paradigm Sensors, LLC, with technology acquired from Marquette through the work of Prof. Marty Seitz in Engineering, was recently honored by R&D Magazine as one of the most technologically significant products of the year. Then in mid-January a lengthy effort on the part of the university to license for commercial development College of Health Sciences Professor David Baker\u0092s research on neurotransmitters in the brain was successfully concluded.  Dr. Baker\u0092s research has shown promise for the treatment of schizophrenia and other central nervous system conditions, and the license will allow the company established for this purpose, Promentis, to explore this further.\n\nThe Wisconsin Reading Acquisition Program, which is housed in the College of Health Sciences\u0092 Dept. of Speech Pathology, received a $4 million grant from the U.S. Department of Education, the largest-three year grant in university history and largest grant ever for the College.\n\nEarly in March the university will welcome a two-person visiting team for the focused visit on assessment that was mandated by our general accreditor, the North Central Association, in the aftermath of our ten-year reaccreditation visit in 2004.  Having read through the self-study prepared by Marquette for this visit, may I say that we are now in a VERY different place as a university in terms of learning assessment than we were in 2004.  We have a clear game plan, it is being carried out well, and more and more areas are discovering from the results what they should do to improve further student learning in their specific disciple or activity.  True enough, assessment at Marquette is a work in progress that we will continue to modify and improve, but I am very encouraged by what has been accomplished.  So I most certainly thank the faculty for their efforts, their cooperation and their patience with all of this, and very especially I thank our Vice Provost, Dr. Peggy Bloom, for without her considerable expertise and her persistence, we would have been nowhere as far along as we are now.  Peggy, thank you indeed!\n\nIn that vein I would note that Marquette is one of 20 four-year institutions currently participating in a comprehensive, campus-wide self-assessment of the first-year college experience. We work hard to help our students make a successful transition to college, but now, to take things a step further, we are with the help of the Foundations of Excellence project of the Policy Center on the First Year of College assessing our programming to determine where and how it can be further improved.\n\nProgress is also being made toward improving aspects of our graduate programs, especially our doctoral programs.  For example, funding has been added to next year\u0092s budget to provide health insurance for those doctoral and master\u0092s students who are serving as teaching and research assistants, an improvement that for some time has been urged by our Graduate Student Association.  In addition, the university has begun working with seven of our doctoral programs to assist the efforts of their respective faculties to improve further their overall quality.\n\nExcellent work on many fronts continues to be accomplished by our Office of Mission and Identity, but I want to single out for special praise the Faber Center for Ignatian Spirituality, which is directed by Mr. Michael Hogan and which offers a variety of programs for faculty and staff to help them to grow spiritually, especially through the riches of the spiritual tradition of St. Ignatius of Loyola.  I am impressed by the creativity and variety of the programs the Center offers \u0096 there really is something for everyone \u0096 and the team running the Faber Center is indeed impressive.\n\nMen\u0092s Basketball, guided by Coach Buzz Williams, is currently ranked 8th in the nation.  Spectacular!  And both our Men\u0092s and our Women\u0092s Basketball teams beat Notre Dame!  For the Women\u0092s team it was the first time in the program\u0092s very proud history that they beat a top 10 ranked team.\n\nSo despite the challenges we face, there is much positive momentum carrying us forward. With regard to Marquette there is every reason for us to remain fundamentally optimistic and hopeful for the future and steadfastly loyal to the values that imbue a Marquette education. Again, my warm thanks to you for all the good things you do for Marquette University, and may God abundantly bless all of us who work and study at this institution.

Regular applications have jumped 20 percent at Montclair State University, 11 percent at Kean University, and an astonishing 40 percent at the New Jersey Institute of Technology.\n\n\n\"That's huge,\" said Jason Langdon, director of undergraduate admissions at Montclair State. \"We usually don't see that kind of swing.\"\n\nMuch of the allure boils down to two little words: in-state tuition.\n\nThe economic slowdown means Carlos Lalata is leaning toward Montclair State for daughter Giselle, who has been admitted to that public school as well as Seton Hall University, a private school.\n\n\"It's $10,000 compared to $30,000,\" said Lalata, a Nutley resident who has seen business drop at his ice cream franchise. \"It's an easy choice.\"\n\nThe big exception to this trend is the state's flagship university, Rutgers, where applications are running 2 percent below this time last year. \"I wish I could explain it,\" said Courtney McAnuff, vice president of enrollment. He suspects some potential applicants are choosing community colleges instead -- tapping the NJ STARS program, which offers free tuition for top students.\n\n\"Although we are a great buy, it's still expensive to go to college in New Jersey,\" he said. \"Families at the bottom tend to get help, and families at the top are okay. But families in the middle are being squeezed -- and they can't refinance their homes.\"\n\nEven Rutgers is seeing signs of a roiling admissions landscape: a 4 percent rise in applications from out-of-state students looking to transfer, and a record number of applications for housing. McAnuff thinks families may be deciding a dorm room makes sense after weighing the cost of both commuting and off-campus housing.\n\n\nRISING STANDARDS\n\nThe statewide surge in applications has created a paradox: Just when more Garden Staters want to attend public colleges, it may be harder for them to get in.\n\nAverage SAT scores are running 10 points higher at Montclair State University, 15 points at Rowan University, 20 points at Kean University. \"It's not a good year to be on the bubble,\" said one admissions officer.\n\nAdmissions staff also sense an extra layer of worry this application season.\n\nParents who always dreamed of private schooling for their children may be abandoning those plans by necessity. \"Maybe the money's not there anymore, so they're changing their plans on the fly,\" said Montclair State's Langdon.\n\nLangdon also said his standard request for midyear grades produced a flurry of frantic calls from applicants' parents this year.\n\n\"You can feel their anxiety. I normally don't get calls from agitated parents about midyear grades,\" he said.\n\nFor years, educators bemoaned the fact that New Jersey tops the nation in the percentage of its students who go to other states for college. The tough economy may have accomplished something all the glossy recruiting brochures couldn't: persuade New Jersey high schoolers to stay in the state to attend college.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the application changes in several Jersey schools:\n\n\nThe New Jersey Institute of Technology reports 40 percent more applications, a 15 percent jump in acceptances and, from those, a 50 percent increase in tuition deposits.\n\nKathryn Kelly, dean of admissions, reports students are also showing a preference for practical areas of study. \"They're much more career-oriented, job-oriented,\" she said. \"They don't know what the future looks like.\"\n\n\nMontclair State University reports a doubling of interest in its invitation-only honors program. While in previous years it would consider applications that rolled in after the March 1 deadline, this year's flood of applicants means the deadline will be firm.\n\nAt Rowan, the number of applications is about the same as last year, but it is coming from a stronger pool of students, said Al Betts, director of admissions. As a result, Rowan has already accepted 2,600 students, compared with 1,700 by this time last year.\n\nRegistration deposits are up as well -- a fairly sure sign those students did not view Rowan as a safety school. \"What this means, you tell me,\" said Betts. \"Maybe it means they want to get a commitment and just get on with it.\"\n\nKean University will increase the size of the freshman class by 300 to 400, but even that won't be enough to accommodate the 11 percent jump in applications, said university president Dawood Farahi. The grade-point average of this year's applicants is almost 3.2, up two-tenths. \"That's a huge jump,\" he said.\n\n\nThe College of New Jersey has seen no bump in applications, but has seen the average SAT score rise by 20 points. And even though the school's application deadline is March 1, all the slots for biology majors are taken, said Lisa Angeloni, dean of admissions.\n\nIn addition, her office is fielding an influx of calls from parents. \"They're calling to say, 'I just lost my job. How can TCNJ help me?'\" she said.\n\nOne big unknown is whether private colleges will respond to this shift by increasing their financial aid offers. Drew University, where applications are running 2 percent ahead of last year, is sending out its aid packages earlier in recognition of the uncertainty some families face, said Mary Beth Carey, Drew's dean of college admissions and financial aid.\n\nDespite the higher sticker price of private schools, families need to look carefully at the bottom line before ruling them out, said Pete Nacy, assistant vice president for admissions at Seton Hall University.\n\nPublic schools often tack on costly fees and may not have as much grant money available, he said. Those factors combine to shrink the gap between Seton Hall and a midlevel state college to $2,000 to $4,000, he said.\n\n\nENROLLMENT MYSTERY\n\nStill unknown is whether the surge in applications will result in more New Jersey students actually attending a public school.\n\nAre teenagers applying to public colleges just to be on the safe side in case their first-choice private school fails to offer enough financial aid? When that acceptance letter from a hotshot private school arrives, will they somehow find the money?\n\nTrying to predict how many admitted students will attend is always a knotty problem for colleges, one likened to landing a jumbo jet on a dime. If too few students attend, tuition revenue lags while expenses stay fixed. Yet if too many attend, there may be a shortage of dorm rooms, parking spaces, lab equipment or class sections.\n\nThe fact housing and tuition deposits are running ahead of last year hints that state schools could end up with record enrollments for the fall.\n\nStill, admissions directors say plunging family finances make it almost impossible to predict enrollment this year. At Seton Hall, where applications are up 16 percent in large part because of a direct marketing campaign, Nacy said he remains uncertain how that will pan out in the fall.\n\n\"The 600-pound gorilla in the room is the economy,\" he said.

Club and sports both meet after school during the same block of time.  As it was, kids were somehow managing to be in two places at once, or in neither place at all, and yet were still claiming membership.  Unfortunately, the honest student who was actually committed to attending meetings and practices was sometimes penalized for local awards and scholarships because it appeared s/he was less involved than the faker.  The abuses became rampant, folks complained, and so the school instituted an attendance standard of 50% for clubs.  While this is an improvement over what was, IMO that standard is ridiculous.  Can you just go to work 50% of the time?  Is it acceptable to only attend class 50% of the time?  Should you only parent 50% of the time?  Anyway, some club advisors skirted the new rule and allowed their pets to miss meetings and events without an attendance penalty.\n\nBut now, clubs whose membership is below a certain number of students will be eliminated next year in order to save money.  So, teachers have allegedly begun allowing students to sign in to club meetings and then leave.  This way, kids can be \"involved\" without really doing anything, and in return the teachers keep their membership numbers high enough so their club survives and they don't lose their advisor's stipend.\n\nI hear similar horror stories from parents at other schools.  Of course, elite colleges are looking for more than mere membership; they want impact or demonstrable results which are easier to verify.  Still, the vast majority of kds aren't applying to the Ivies and top LAC's.   Isn't it about time colleges put less emphasis on EC's?  Kids think adcoms want to see EC's, but many don't have the time or interest to really do them, and this nonsense is the result.  Membership and club involvement is too hard to verify for the ordinary drone.

These studies also seem to assume that there are no financial constraints on admitting more URM or low-income students.

Both Siegel and Fox acted as facilitators in Smith\u2019s LASE 151 class, \u201cHonor and Ethics Everyday Life,\u201d in the past fall semester.\n\nThe class was a pass/fail one-credit course that met once a week in small sections.\n\nAccording to testimony given by Siegel, the primary witness during the trial, LASE 151 was a class of about 40 students divided into three small sections, which were led by student facilitators. Fox and Siegel, who were two of the six students chosen to facilitate the small sections, led the section of 10 students of which Smith was a part.\n\nDuring the semester, the class was assigned to turn in an informal one- to two-page reflection paper Oct. 1 that discussed \u201cwhat you were feeling about the class\u201d Siegel said during the trial.\n\nSmith did not turn in the assignment and then was absent the next class meeting Oct. 8, she said. Smith e-mailed Siegel Oct. 9, explaining that his absence was a result of a family emergency. According to statements made by the counsel for the accused, Smith\u2019s aunt was incarcerated during that time and Smith went home to help his family.\n\nJeff Smith, brother of the accused and the fourth witness at the trial, said there was \u201ca lot of fallout that needed to be attended to.\u201d\nSmith again did not attend the class Oct. 15, however, and still had not turned in his reflection paper, Siegel said in her testimony.\nAccording to the facts of the trial presented by the counsel for the accused, Smith did not e-mail the facilitators about this second absence and \u201caccepted that it was unexcused.\u201d\n\nThe entire LASE 151 class met in the Honor Committee\u2019s trial room on the fourth floor Newcomb Oct. 22 for a guest speaker and Siegel and Fox decided to pull Smith aside to discuss his absences and reflection paper.\n\nDuring this time, Smith told Siegel and Fox that one of his absences was because his wallet had been stolen and that he had to go to the Bank of America to replace his credit cards and that the other absence was because he had a paper due in another class the next week and chose to miss LASE 151 to work on that assignment, Siegel said.\n\nWhile Smith provided explanations for his absences, he did not discuss why he had not turned his reflection paper in yet. Additionally, he did not mention the family emergency that he had discussed previously in an e-mail.\n\nWhen asked why he did not mention this excuse, he said he \u201cdidn\u2019t want to reveal the extent of the nature of the family emergency.\u201d\n\nAccording to the class\u2019 syllabus, one-third of the student\u2019s grades in the class came from participation and attendance and each student was allowed one unexcused absence and all other absences had to be discussed with Siegel or Fox.\n\nThough it was never clarified with Smith whether his absences were excused or not, Smith still expressed interest in passing the class, Siegel said during the trial.\n\n\u201cJason kept telling us he wanted to put forth effort\u201d so that he could pass the class, Siegel said.\n\nAs a result, Siegel and Fox assigned Smith an alternative assignment that consisted of two papers that were each to be three to four pages in length.\n\nOf the two papers, one of them was supposed to discuss the importance of the class, the purpose of coming to class and Smith\u2019s reasons for missing the class twice.\n\nSiegel and Fox assigned the papers to be due Oct. 29.\n\nOn that particular day, Siegel and Fox chose to cancel class to give their students the opportunity to work on their group projects for the class and Smith was given the option of submitting his papers either via e-mail or to Siegel\u2019s mailbox in Newcomb.\n\nBy Nov. 3, half a week after Smith\u2019s modified due date, Siegel said she was sitting on the Lawn that day when Smith walked by her. Siegel told Smith that she still had not received his two papers. According to Siegel\u2019s testimony, Smith told her he had already written the papers, they were on his flash drive and he would e-mail them to Siegel as soon as he got out of class.\n\nDuring the trial, Smith said he did not \u201cparticularly remember\u201d telling Siegel his papers were on a flash drive. Both of the papers were turned in size-14 font and not in Times New Roman font, Siegel claimed. Though there were no references on the class\u2019 syllabus about paper formatting, Siegel said she decided to \u201cstandardize\u201d them into size 12 Times New Roman font.\n\nOnce Siegel changed the size of the font, neither of the papers met the length requirements assigned to Smith by Siegel and Fox. When Fox asked why Smith had used the font that he did, Smith responded that his \u201ccomputer does that.\u201d\n\nFox said Smith\u2019s papers had \u201clittle to no effort put into them,\u201d and that it was obvious he was \u201cjust doing the bare minimum.\u201d\n\nSiegel and Fox asked Smith when he actually wrote the two papers and he said he had written each of them before their original due date of Oct. 29. Siegel said she then checked the date created function on the papers and saw that each of the papers were typed Nov. 3, the day Smith turned them in.\n\nIn his paper, Smith attributed his absences to being sick and working to finish another assignment; he did not mention the family emergency or his allegedly lost wallet. Fox then held a meeting with Smith Nov. 11 to confront him about this discrepancy. Fox told Smith that she and Siegel felt he was being dishonest with them.\n\nSmith said he had completed the papers Oct. 27 or 28, before his Oct. 29 deadline, but that he had written the papers by hand because of a \u201cnasty virus\u201d on his computer. It was not until Nov. 3 around 7 p.m., after he had run into Siegel on the Lawn, that he typed the papers on a computer in the library.\n\nSmith said Siegel\u2019s e-mail only asked him to clarify when he wrote the papers and not when he typed the papers and admitted that he could see how his comments \u201ccould be perceived as deceiving.\u201d\n\nAccording to Fox\u2019s testimony, Smith seemed to treat the situation very casually and said, \u201cHey, I\u2019m a nice guy,\u201d when she met with him.\nIn addition to speaking with Smith, Fox asked him to bring his laptop to the meeting so she could check and see when the papers were typed on the laptop. Neither of the papers were on Smith\u2019s laptop.\n\nBoth Siegel and Fox said they decided Smith would not receive credit for the course, but were unsure as to whether they should bring him up on honor charges. Siegel decided to print out all of the e-mails and create a timeline of the actions in question.\n\n\u201cAfter really looking at that on Nov. 15, we decided we would go forward with honor charges,\u201d Siegel said.\n\nSiegel said she believed something like this \u201cwould change the way students interact with students\u201d if left unchallenged, as Siegel and Fox were acting in the role of teachers for the class.\n\n\u201cA degree from the University of Virginia has a certain significance,\u201d Fox said during the trial, and \u201cleaving this to go unnoticed\u201d would diminish that.\n\nSmith said the comments he made to Siegel may have been \u201cmisleading, but I didn\u2019t mislead her intentionally.\u201d\n\nDuring his testimony, Smith said he had not yet enrolled in LASE 151 before its first class session and had thus not received the syllabus when it was passed out to the large group during the first day of class. He did, however, receive a copy of the syllabus during the first small section class and said he \u201cglanced over it.\u201d\n\nSiegel said the first couple of weeks of the class \u201cwere dedicated just to honor,\u201d and despite the fact that the honor code was not discussed in the LASE 151 syllabus and that Smith missed the first day of class, honor was \u201cdiscussed during the first couple of weeks of class\u201d and Smith was aware of it, Siegel said.\n\nIn the end, the evidence brought forth against Smith was enough for jury members to convict.\n\nThird-year Law student Robert Baldwin, who attended the trial, however, expressed some concern about Siegel\u2019s role within the Honor Committee and about how that role could have influenced jury members to find Smith guilty.\n\n\u201cWhen that first community witness was testifying, she [Siegel] very clearly knew the language of the procedure ... and in my mind I thought she must be a counselor or be on the committee,\u201d Baldwin said.\n\nCurrent Committee Chair Jess Huang, however, said she does not believe Siegel\u2019s role in honor had any impact on the trial.\n\n\u201cI think this is just a great example of a student who really wanted to enforce the standards of the community of trust and brought it up for another student panel to decide,\u201d Huang said in an interview later Sunday night.\n\nTo be found guilty of an honor offense, four-fifths of a jury has to find a student guilty of act and intent and a simple majority has to find him guilty of non-triviality. Smith chose a random student jury that consisted of 11 undergraduate students and one graduate student; the jury yesterday included five first-year students, three second-year students, three third-year students and one Darden student.\n\nAfter the first break, one jury member was asked to leave after she was caught reading a book under her desk during the trial.\n\nAccording to the Committee\u2019s bylaws, if he so chooses, Smith can appeal the jury\u2019s decision either on the grounds of new evidence or good cause.\n\n\n\nSomething that we don't normally see very often at UVA, but nevertheless points out the obvious flaws in the honor system.

My daughter\u0092s dream was USNA. In Feb of her Jr year she applied to NASS and was accepted, she thought she had won the lottery!  Immediately thereafter, she made contact with her BGO. Her BGO gave her frequent advice at every step . She made my daughter send her essay and then encouraged her to revise it at least 5-6 even 7 times. My daughter consulted her for everything USNA related. She thought she was getting solid advice and had a false sense of security. These are the harsh lessons she learned along the way.\n1.\tAccepted to NASS-won the lottery\u0085\u0085 NOT! : If you go-be prepared to do well on the CFA This was perhaps my daughter\u0092s downfall. Every NASS participant is given the CFA at SS. Their scores can tank and they WILL be recorded as their 1st results. My daughter did not do well but was encouraged because she was told you 'can always resubmit them.'\n2.\tSAT scores. Now with the new College Board Option, BE SELECTIVE as to which scores you send. Like the CFA results, once they record low scores it is not easy to be looked at a second time. Up until this year, ALL score were sent so even if you improved your scores over time, you will have a hard time being academically q\u0092d . They could see the low scores on record. Despite her 94GPA, NHS and great EC's\nDespite her resubmission of passing, actually excellent CFA scores in NOV and SAT scores of M/660 and 720/V, and she was DoDMERB q\u0092d  she was never given triple Q. Her admissions counselor told her BGO that the board did not consider her to be up to the academic challenges despite the subsequent success on her SAT\u0092s.\nHere\u0092s the message:  Don\u0092t be over anxious and have a false sense of security with all the contact you may or may not have with BGO\u0092s and USNA. Heres whyIronically, with the exception of a 15 min interview with her ALO- she was offered a full appointment to USAFA, with no contact she was offered a full appointment to USMMA  and USCGA (she did not apply to USMA).  Although she had a lot of contact with USNA, the old adage \u0091less is more \u0091 seems to be very pertinent. Contact is good, but make sure you have passing scores before you but numbers on record.\nThe two most important lessons my daughter learned, 1- she should have skipped NASS as she was not there yet physically. A wonderful experience yes but it clearly does not give you a leg up UNLESS and IF you are already in top physical shape and 2-should waited to send her scores until she had scores which met USNA standards M/600/V/600. Once the board reviews you and gives you the red mark, it is next to impossible to get them to accept improvements.\nShe has not decided yet where she will go, is visiting USAFA this month. She is a wonderful young  lady who will serve her country proudly, just not at USNA! Best of luck to all and hope this post message will help others who have a dream of attending Annapolis.

Why We Should Get Rid of West Point\nBy Thomas E. Ricks\nSunday, April 19, 2009\n\n\nWant to trim the federal budget and improve the military at the same time?\nShut down West Point, Annapolis and the Air Force Academy, and use some of the\nsavings to expand ROTC scholarships.\n\n\nAfter covering the U.S. military for nearly two decades, I've concluded that\ngraduates of the service academies don't stand out compared to other officers.\nYet producing them is more than twice as expensive as taking in graduates of\ncivilian schools ($300,000 per West Point product vs. $130,000 for ROTC\nstudent). On top of the economic advantage, I've been told by some commanders\nthat they prefer officers who come out of ROTC programs, because they tend to\nbe better educated and less cynical about the military.\n\n\nThis is no knock on the academies' graduates. They are crackerjack smart and\ndedicated to national service. They remind me of the best of the Ivy League,\nbut too often they're getting community-college educations. Although West\nPoint's history and social science departments provided much intellectual\nfirepower in rethinking the U.S. approach to Iraq, most of West Point's\nfaculty lacks doctorates. Why not send young people to more rigorous\ninstitutions on full scholarships, and then, upon graduation, give them a\nmilitary education at a short-term military school? Not only do ROTC graduates\nmake fine officers -- three of the last six chairmen of the Joint Chiefs of\nStaff reached the military that way -- they also would be educated alongside\nfuture doctors, judges, teachers, executives, mayors and members of Congress.\nThat would be good for both the military and the society it protects.\n\n\nWe should also consider closing the services' war colleges, where colonels\nsupposedly learn strategic thinking. These institutions strike me as\nsecond-rate. If we want to open the minds of rising officers and prepare them\nfor top command, we should send them to civilian schools where their\nassumptions will be challenged, and where they will interact with diplomats\nand executives, not to a service institution where they can reinforce their\nbiases while getting in afternoon golf games. Just ask David Petraeus, a\nPrinceton PhD.\n\n\nThomas E. Ricks is a senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security\nand author of \"The Gamble,\" about the Iraq war from 2006 to 2008.

Why Our Country Needs West Point\nSaturday, April 25, 2009\n\n\nYou will see that this small two letter bit is buried in the Post, very small\ncompared to the Headlines including on Page One on April 19 for the \"Get Rid\nof\" articles.\n\n\nWhy We Need West Point\n\n\n\nAs a West Point graduate who has spent nearly 20 years in the military, I\nfound Thomas E. Ricks's piece [\"10 Things We Should Toss: West Point,\"\nOutlook, April 19] on closing the academy deeply troubling and insulting.\n\n\nFor more than 200 years, the U.S. Military Academy at West Point has been\nproducing leaders of character and intellect who have shaped our nation's\ndestiny.\n\n\nMr. Ricks made the outrageous claim that West Point graduates receive a\n\"community-college\" education; I suggest that he check his facts. Among other\nachievements, West Point has produced the fourth-highest number of Rhodes\nScholarship recipients of any college (bested only by Harvard, Yale and\nPrinceton). And where do you think Gen. David H. Petraeus developed the\nprofessional and intellectual foundations of his success, including the\nPrinceton PhD that so many seem to fawn over? That's right: West Point.\n\n\nJAMES HAYES\n\nLorton\n\n\n\nThomas E. Ricks devoted almost a third of his piece on abolishing the service\nacademies to closing the military war colleges, which have no connection to\nthe service academies. In fact, I probably agree with Mr. Ricks about the war\ncolleges.\n\n\nAlso, if cost were the only issue in deciding what should be eliminated, why\nstop at service academies? ROTC is much more expensive than Officer Candidate\nSchool and direct commissioning. The biggest reason for having the academies\nas well as the other sources of officers is having a diversity of leadership\npipelines.\n\n\nFinally, I don't know how Mr. Ricks can state in one sentence that academy\ngraduates tend to be less educated and more cynical about the military and\nthen in the next say that is not a knock on those graduates. That thought,\nwith its data based on discussions with \"some commanders,\" reveals the lack of\ndepth Mr. Ricks brings to this issue.\n\n\nJIM LUEHMAN\n\n\nNew Market\n\n\n\nIV.

He flies the Pennants Charlie Bravo -- Coward and\nBlowhard for his conduct and failure to step like a man to the Corps, Brigade,\nand Regiments.\n\n\nHe owes you a manly apology and and effort to systematically and rigorously\nexamine the Academies -- which all graduates, midshipmen and cadets of all\nAcademies and students and graduates of the War Colleges invite.\n\n\nJohn Pomfret cowers, pointing to Letters to the Editor, as if the tiny space\nin the Letters column of this Dying Newspaper is sufficient to the\nincompetence and dishonesty of Pomfret and Ricks.\n\n\nThe so-called Ombudsman Andy Alexander hides behind a narrow jurisdictional\ndefinition of only covering news, as if he were not a man and professional\nwith a charter and power and his own voice.\n\n\nNo one on the Post seems able to choose, in the words of the USMA Cadet\nPrayer, the \"Harder Right\" over the \"Easier Wrong.\"\n\n\nThey dishonor the Editors of Old of the Washington Post, with whom I worked\nfor 30 years, including Al Horne, Meg Greenfield, and Steve Rosenfeld.\n\n\nThey do discredit to their Chairman Donald Graham and the Graham Family, who\nhave led the Post for years.

In Defense of West Point: A Cadet Responds to Thomas Ricks\nBy Tianyi Xin; The New Ledger, 21 April 2009\n\n\nMy fellow cadets at West Point, in moments of overwhelming stress and\ncynicism, often compare our \"rockbound highland home\" to prison. Like\ninmates, cadets are regularly deprived of a wide range of social\nfreedoms that \"normal college students\" would see as constitutional\nrights\u0097we are told when, what, and where to sleep, eat, and wear. Our\ncampus is secured on all perimeters by gates and security guards and\nentry into and out of West Point is tightly regulated. Most of the\ntime, West Point feels more like the Panopticon than it does20Harvard\nYard. Thomas E. Ricks of the Washington Post voiced the sentiments of\nmany of my classmates (myself included) during periods of utter\nexhaustion and pessimism when he declared this weekend that \"we should\nget rid of West Point.\"\n\n\nSo why do my classmates and I still stand proudly in the Long Gray\nLine? Because we think it\u0092s worth it.\n\n\nWest Point\u0092s high standards of academic excellence are what initially\nattracted me and many of my classmates to apply. Though Mr. Ricks was\ncorrect in noting that most of West Point\u0092s faculty lack doctorates,\nall of West Point\u0092s teachers have earned advanced degrees. About half\nof our instructors are rotating active duty officers who bring more\nthan just PhD\u0092s to the classroom. Lessons about electromagnetic waves\nare interspersed with anecdotes from the battlefields of Iraq; my\nteachers bring to light the realities of war alongside abstract\nintellectual concepts. They are invested in us in ways that reach far\nbeyond the report card; when we graduate with our heads full of\nknowledge that they have taught us, we walk into the larger fold of the\nArmy that they are part of, and often serve on the same battlefields as\nlieutenants under their direct command.\n\n\n\nCompared with the large, impersonal classes of many of undergraduate\nprograms, West Point classes above 18 students require the Dean\u0092s\napproval and cadets have the home phon e numbers of most of our instructors,\nall of whom we are free to call for additional instruction. West Point has\ngraduated\n83 Rhodes Scholars, two American\nPresidents, and countless statesmen and scientists who have made great\ncontributions to society past their active duty commitments. A century\nago, Theodore Roosevelt declared that \"no other educational institution\nin the land has contributed as many names as West Point has contributed\nto the honor roll of the nation\u0092s greatest citizens\" \u0097 and it is still\ntrue today.\n\n\nI would challenge Mr. Ricks to sit in on one day of my classes here\nat West Point and walk away still convinced that my classmates and I\nare receiving a \"community-college education.\"\n\n\nMr. Ricks wants to dispose of West Point in order to trim the federal\nbudget in response to the economic crisis. However, West Point is\nalready downsizing; many of our academic departments and athletic\nprograms have suffered significant cutbacks. Our Commandant recently\nannounced future reductions in the size of the staff and faculty as\nwell as the enrollment numbers here at West Point. But how much should\nwe sacrifice? And will these cutbacks make America stronger, or weaker\non the battlefield?\n\n\nIn these challenging times of conflict when the rules of warfare are\nconstantly shifting, our Army needs officers equipped with the\nknowledge gained from a variety of backgrounds and experiences. West 0D\nPoint provides not only 20% of the Army\u0092s 2nd Lieutenants, but also 60%\nof the officers with hard science degrees\u0097degrees the Army desperately\nneeds. The service academies alongside other commissioning sources\u0097ROTC\nand OCS (Officer Candidate School from which Non-Commissioned Officers\ngain their commissions)\u0097provide a diverse pool of problem solvers and\ndecision makers to lead our Army.\n\n\nEven more importantly, West Point has taught us the intangible things\nthat refuse to fit neatly into statistical charts and balance sheets\npresented to Congress. Mr. Ricks cannot measure the value of the\ncamaraderie gained by roughing through a 15-mile ruck march together\none day and calculus homework the next; the sense of integrity\nengrained into our psyches through the Cadet Honor Code; and the\nability to handle the rigors of day-to-day cadet life replete with\nacademic, athletic, and military requirements. West Point immerses us\nin a demanding, high-stress military environment, and cadets\ninternalize the values of perseverance, integrity, and selfless service\namong other principles so that they become almost second nature. No\nknock on ROTC, but West Point cadets don\u0092t just attend military classes\na few times a week and fall back into to regular civilian lives\u0097we live\nand breathe military culture from Reveille to Taps (and often in the\nwee hours of the morning in between Taps and Reveille).\n\n\nWest Point and our sister academies represent far more than just\nservice oriented undergraduate institutions. Our schools also serve\nimportant diplomatic functions that strengthen ties with foreign\nmilitary forces. West Point hosts four year and semester long exchange\nprograms for foreign cadets from Austria, Germany, Albania, Kenya, and\nmany other countries. Last weekend, we hosted the 2009 Sandhurst Cup, a\ntwo-day military skills competition where West Point cadets competed\nagainst our foreign counterparts from Britain, Canada, Afghanistan and,\nfor the first time, Chile.\n\nIn trying times like these when American blood is spilled on foreign\nsoils in pursuit of lofty ideals such as democracy and freedom, we\nlearn that some things simply don\u0092t carry price tags. Though excess and\nwastefulness certainly aren\u0092t the right answers, there are some things\nwe should never surrender in the name of efficiency or\ncost-effectiveness. How is it that in a time when government is\nspending on programs, infrastructure, and bailouts at an\never-increasing rate, West Point is judged expendable?\n\n\n\nWest Point is a crucible that molds us into leaders of character. We\ncadets forfeit free time and sleep to endure pressures that most\ncollege students would never put up with because we know the payoff\nafter graduation is something that can\u0092t be calculated in dollars\u0097a\nsolid education that will prepare us to lead our nation\u0092s sons and\ndaughters into harm\u0092s way. Douglas MacArthur once noted that \"in war\nthere is no substitute for victory.\" In America there is no substitute\nfor West Point.\n\n\nJust ask the hero of Mr. Ricks\u0092 most recent book \u0097 David Petraeus,\nclass of 1974 West Point graduate.\n\n\nVII.  Dear Tom:\n\n\n\nI read in your piece and in parts of your recent book distillations of\nmany conversations we've had on the subject of officer education. As you\nknow I've been toiling in the fields of educational reform for many\nyears. I also realize that I am responsible sewing the seeds of at least\na few of your opinions. So what follows are some responses most of which\nyou will find familiar.\n\n\n\nI'm uncomfortable with loopers who list their cv's but a few things\nabout my background are important at least to summarize:\n\n*         Eighteen of my thirty five years of service were in TRADOC\nand\nwhat is today NDU. I believe among general officers this is\nunprecedented.\n\n*         After retirement I was president of a successful and large\nprivate university\n\n\n*         I'm a West Point graduate, class of 66, the \"Long Grey\nLine\"\nclass that Rick Atkinson wrote about\n\n\n*         I was an early advocate of the John McCain school of\nacademy\nachievement graduating in the top five percent of the bottom fifth and a\nfirst class sergeant.\n\n\n*         Both of my children graduated from fully funded ROTC\nprograms,\nWake Forest and Notre Dame at my encouragement. I strongly support women\nat West Point but I thought my two daughters would be better\nacculturated to the world by attending a civilian university before\ncommissioning.\n\n\n*         I earned my PhD from Duke on my own and did not teach at\nWest\nPoint.\n\n\n*         I've spent most of the past ten years as an advocate for\nreform in military education working with various committees as well as\nIke Skelton and Steve Israel. So far  my efforts have pretty much\nfailed.\n\n\nNow a summary of our discussions:\n\n\n*         The greatest failures in our current wars have been human\nand\nintellectual not technological.\n\n\n*         As we discussed there seems to be a curious pattern of\nsuccess\namong this intellectual failure in Iraq and Afghanistan. It seems that\nthe many of the most successful general officers share a distinct\nprovenance: they earned a degree in the human sciences and later taught\nat West Point. This includes such men as Petraeus, Chiarelli, Dempsey,\nMcMaster, Eikenberry among many others of lesser rank some of whom are\nloopers.\n\n\n*         It's important to realize how small this field really is.\nThey\ncome from four departments: History, Social Sciences, English and\nBehavioral Sciences and Leadership. So we're talking about a production\nrate of about two dozen per year among all the services.\n\n\n*         Of course there have been many brilliant outliers in the\nlist\nof intellectually gifted. Jim Mattis and Jim Dubik come to mind. But\nmost of these men share the same passion for reading history and\nthinking about the human side of war.\n\n\nSo, Tom, what should we make of all this? Some thoughts:\n\n\n*         The value of the service academies does not come from the\npedagogical pedigree of their faculties or the richness of their\ncurricula. All are top tier schools. But value comes from their ability\nto attract very talented high school students to serve. Were it not for\nthe mystique of the academies few of them would have ever thought about\nservice to the nation. Second, the academies are brilliant at\nsocializing these men and women to the military tribe, a process often\nvery difficult in a liberal democracy. Socialization is vital in many\naspects of military culture: basic training for soldiers and marines;\nranger and airborne schools for combat arms; hell week, selection and\nthe Q course for the special operations community. For bean counters\nthese schools are a needless waste. There really is no pedagogical\njustification for the attrition and lack of relevance of, say, the\nairborne and ranger school merit badges for close combat officers. But\nwe all know intuitively that such schools add value that cannot be\nquantified. I commanded a training brigade in TRADOC so I know first\nhand that military socialization works. But I'm not sure any\npsychologist can explain how and why it works. I jut know we should\ntread very carefully before summarily altering a method that produces\noutstanding results.\n\n\n*         So that's why it's far more important to have a combat\nseasoned young captain or major with an MA teaching cadets rather than a\ncivilian PhD. Doctorates are needed to teach graduate students but not\nfor undergraduates. We have too many civilians and not enough upwardly\nmobile officers on academy faculties particularly in the human sciences.\nWe need to change our criteria to make more not fewer Petraeuses.\n\n\n*         About every 15 years since the early nineteenth century\nprotectors of the republic have attacked the academies with particular\nemphasis on West Point. They view them as threats to the republic, in\nessence tiny bits of Sparta in the midst of Babylon. Many still believe\nthat somehow Jefferson got it wrong in proposing an institution that\nthey believe might threaten our political systems. This of course is\nridiculous. But only such a phenomenon can explain the vitriol that's\nperiodically thrown at these relatively small pieces of our defense\nestablishment.\n\n\nSo Tom the issue is not the service academies or the war colleges for\nthat matter. It's really how to change the techno-centric culture of our\nmilitary so that it's better prepared to fight the irregular wars that\nwill challenge us for a generation. As we discussed one answer is to do\na better job of educating our leaders. But this should be an additive\nrather than an eliminative process. We have the most experienced cadre\nof leaders in our history but these are practical men and women who are\nintellectually levels deep but not terribly broad. Few have had the time\nor the disciplined environment to expand their experiential base. As\nI've said on the loop before we should:\n\n\n*         Change the statutes such that our officers are rewarded\nrather\nthan punished for learning. The enemy here is not the academies but the\nvarious service personnel systems that reward time in the field over\ntime spent in reflective thought and intellectual achievement.  Our\nyoung officers are ambitious. If they perceived that study and academic\nachievement were career enhancing we would not have any problem finding\nacademically qualified candidates to become future Petreauses.\n\n\n*         To make more Petraeuses we should offer every Army and\nMarine\nofficer who completes company command successfully a two year sabbatical\nat a first tier graduate school to study the art of war and alien\ncultures. They should then be fast tracked to GO without having to squat\nin some billet just to meet the statutory requirements for jointness.\n\n\n*         No officer should be promoted to Colonel without\ndemonstrating\nproficiency in a language spoken by potential enemies.\n\n\n*         We should require the PhD degree for all instructors at war\ncolleges and we should give them the time to acquire the degree. We\nshould reward them for teaching through promotion and selection for\ncommand. Again, this is a human resources not an academic problem.\n\n\n*         To achieve such reforms we must increase the proportion of\nofficers on active duty such that we create \"waste\" in the form of more\nman years for study of all sorts: seconding to other federal agencies\nand think tanks; long term attendance at civilian graduate schools;\nattendance at more foreign service schools; time spent with industry and\nas interns in Congress and the NSC. I could go on but you get the\nthought.\n\n\n*         We need a chief learning officer in OSD someone who can\nbalance the insidious damage done by the personnelists who too often\nmake decisions about promotion and education policy antithetical to all\nthe above. He or she should be at the assistant secretary level.\n\n\n*         Promotion boards should see two files, one for duty\nperformance and one for intellectual achievement. Key strategic billets\nin the Joint Staff and NSC should be reserved fro those who pass muster\nfor the latter as well as the former. General officer selection for\nthese key billets should be tied to the intellectual file. A stint as an\ninstructor in any service school should be a prerequisite for selection\nto these billets.\n\n\n\nI could go on but you get the point. My problem with your piece is that\nits incendiary nature might deflect us from the greater task of\nfundamentally reforming how the military learns and rewards those who\nare good at learning.\n\n\n\nPlease don't take offense. Hope we're still friends.\n\n\n\nBob Scales\n\n\n\nVIII. Here is a voice recording that expresses why the Academies will live as\nlong as the Republic.

Why We Should Get Rid of West Point\nBy Thomas E. Ricks\nSunday, April 19, 2009\n\n\nWant to trim the federal budget and improve the military at the same time?\nShut down West Point, Annapolis and the Air Force Academy, and use some of the\nsavings to expand ROTC scholarships.\n\n\nAfter covering the U.S. military for nearly two decades, I've concluded that\ngraduates of the service academies don't stand out compared to other officers.\nYet producing them is more than twice as expensive as taking in graduates of\ncivilian schools ($300,000 per West Point product vs. $130,000 for ROTC\nstudent). On top of the economic advantage, I've been told by some commanders\nthat they prefer officers who come out of ROTC programs, because they tend to\nbe better educated and less cynical about the military.\n\n\nThis is no knock on the academies' graduates. They are crackerjack smart and\ndedicated to national service. They remind me of the best of the Ivy League,\nbut too often they're getting community-college educations. Although West\nPoint's history and social science departments provided much intellectual\nfirepower in rethinking the U.S. approach to Iraq, most of West Point's\nfaculty lacks doctorates. Why not send young people to more rigorous\ninstitutions on full scholarships, and then, upon graduation, give them a\nmilitary education at a short-term military school? Not only do ROTC graduates\nmake fine officers -- three of the last six chairmen of the Joint Chiefs of\nStaff reached the military that way -- they also would be educated alongside\nfuture doctors, judges, teachers, executives, mayors and members of Congress.\nThat would be good for both the military and the society it protects.\n\n\nWe should also consider closing the services' war colleges, where colonels\nsupposedly learn strategic thinking. These institutions strike me as\nsecond-rate. If we want to open the minds of rising officers and prepare them\nfor top command, we should send them to civilian schools where their\nassumptions will be challenged, and where they will interact with diplomats\nand executives, not to a service institution where they can reinforce their\nbiases while getting in afternoon golf games. Just ask David Petraeus, a\nPrinceton PhD.\n\n\nThomas E. Ricks is a senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security\nand author of \"The Gamble,\" about the Iraq war from 2006 to 2008. He will\ndiscuss this article at 1 p.m. on Monday at\nLive Q&As - washingtonpost.com.\n\n\n\n\n\nIII.  Why Our Country Needs West Point\nSaturday, April 25, 2009\n\n\nYou will see that this small two letter bit is buried in the Post, very small\ncompared to the Headlines including on Page One on April 19 for the \"Get Rid\nof\" articles.\n\n\nWhy We Need West Point\n\n\n\nAs a West Point graduate who has spent nearly 20 years in the military, I\nfound Thomas E. Ricks's piece [\"10 Things We Should Toss: West Point,\"\nOutlook, April 19] on closing the academy deeply troubling and insulting.\n\n\nFor more than 200 years, the U.S. Military Academy at West Point has been\nproducing leaders of character and intellect who have shaped our nation's\ndestiny.\n\n\nMr. Ricks made the outrageous claim that West Point graduates receive a\n\"community-college\" education; I suggest that he check his facts. Among other\nachievements, West Point has produced the fourth-highest number of Rhodes\nScholarship recipients of any college (bested only by Harvard, Yale and\nPrinceton). And where do you think Gen. David H. Petraeus developed the\nprofessional and intellectual foundations of his success, including the\nPrinceton PhD that so many seem to fawn over? That's right: West Point.\n\n\nJAMES HAYES\n\nLorton\n\n\n\nThomas E. Ricks devoted almost a third of his piece on abolishing the service\nacademies to closing the military war colleges, which have no connection to\nthe service academies. In fact, I probably agree with Mr. Ricks about the war\ncolleges.\n\n\nAlso, if cost were the only issue in deciding what should be eliminated, why\nstop at service academies? ROTC is much more expensive than Officer Candidate\nSchool and direct commissioning. The biggest reason for having the academies\nas well as the other sources of officers is having a diversity of leadership\npipelines.\n\n\nFinally, I don't know how Mr. Ricks can state in one sentence that academy\ngraduates tend to be less educated and more cynical about the military and\nthen in the next say that is not a knock on those graduates. That thought,\nwith its data based on discussions with \"some commanders,\" reveals the lack of\ndepth Mr. Ricks brings to this issue.\n\n\nJIM LUEHMAN\n\n\nNew Market\n\n\n\nIV.

In Defense of West Point: A Cadet Responds to Thomas Ricks\nBy Tianyi Xin; The New Ledger, 21 April 2009\n\n\nMy fellow cadets at West Point, in moments of overwhelming stress and\ncynicism, often compare our \"rockbound highland home\" to prison. Like\ninmates, cadets are regularly deprived of a wide range of social\nfreedoms that \"normal college students\" would see as constitutional\nrights\u0097we are told when, what, and where to sleep, eat, and wear. Our\ncampus is secured on all perimeters by gates and security guards and\nentry into and out of West Point is tightly regulated. Most of the\ntime, West Point feels more like the Panopticon than it does20Harvard\nYard. Thomas E. Ricks of the Washington Post voiced the sentiments of\nmany of my classmates (myself included) during periods of utter\nexhaustion and pessimism when he declared this weekend that \"we should\nget rid of West Point.\"\n\n\nSo why do my classmates and I still stand proudly in the Long Gray\nLine? Because we think it\u0092s worth it.\n\n\nWest Point\u0092s high standards of academic excellence are what initially\nattracted me and many of my classmates to apply. Though Mr. Ricks was\ncorrect in noting that most of West Point\u0092s faculty lack doctorates,\nall of West Point\u0092s teachers have earned advanced degrees. About half\nof our instructors are rotating active duty officers who bring more\nthan just PhD\u0092s to the classroom. Lessons about electromagnetic waves\nare interspersed with anecdotes from the battlefields of Iraq; my\nteachers bring to light the realities of war alongside abstract\nintellectual concepts. They are invested in us in ways that reach far\nbeyond the report card; when we graduate with our heads full of\nknowledge that they have taught us, we walk into the larger fold of the\nArmy that they are part of, and often serve on the same battlefields as\nlieutenants under their direct command.\n\n\n\nCompared with the large, impersonal classes of many of undergraduate\nprograms, West Point classes above 18 students require the Dean\u0092s\napproval and cadets have the home phon e numbers of most of our instructors,\nall of whom we are free to call for additional instruction. West Point has\ngraduated\n83 Rhodes Scholars, two American\nPresidents, and countless statesmen and scientists who have made great\ncontributions to society past their active duty commitments. A century\nago, Theodore Roosevelt declared that \"no other educational institution\nin the land has contributed as many names as West Point has contributed\nto the honor roll of the nation\u0092s greatest citizens\" \u0097 and it is still\ntrue today.\n\n\nI would challenge Mr. Ricks to sit in on one day of my classes here\nat West Point and walk away still convinced that my classmates and I\nare receiving a \"community-college education.\"\n\n\nMr. Ricks wants to dispose of West Point in order to trim the federal\nbudget in response to the economic crisis. However, West Point is\nalready downsizing; many of our academic departments and athletic\nprograms have suffered significant cutbacks. Our Commandant recently\nannounced future reductions in the size of the staff and faculty as\nwell as the enrollment numbers here at West Point. But how much should\nwe sacrifice? And will these cutbacks make America stronger, or weaker\non the battlefield?\n\n\nIn these challenging times of conflict when the rules of warfare are\nconstantly shifting, our Army needs officers equipped with the\nknowledge gained from a variety of backgrounds and experiences. West 0D\nPoint provides not only 20% of the Army\u0092s 2nd Lieutenants, but also 60%\nof the officers with hard science degrees\u0097degrees the Army desperately\nneeds. The service academies alongside other commissioning sources\u0097ROTC\nand OCS (Officer Candidate School from which Non-Commissioned Officers\ngain their commissions)\u0097provide a diverse pool of problem solvers and\ndecision makers to lead our Army.\n\n\nEven more importantly, West Point has taught us the intangible things\nthat refuse to fit neatly into statistical charts and balance sheets\npresented to Congress. Mr. Ricks cannot measure the value of the\ncamaraderie gained by roughing through a 15-mile ruck march together\none day and calculus homework the next; the sense of integrity\nengrained into our psyches through the Cadet Honor Code; and the\nability to handle the rigors of day-to-day cadet life replete with\nacademic, athletic, and military requirements. West Point immerses us\nin a demanding, high-stress military environment, and cadets\ninternalize the values of perseverance, integrity, and selfless service\namong other principles so that they become almost second nature. No\nknock on ROTC, but West Point cadets don\u0092t just attend military classes\na few times a week and fall back into to regular civilian lives\u0097we live\nand breathe military culture from Reveille to Taps (and often in the\nwee hours of the morning in between Taps and Reveille).\n\n\nWest Point and our sister academies represent far more than just\nservice oriented undergraduate institutions. Our schools also serve\nimportant diplomatic functions that strengthen ties with foreign\nmilitary forces. West Point hosts four year and semester long exchange\nprograms for foreign cadets from Austria, Germany, Albania, Kenya, and\nmany other countries. Last weekend, we hosted the 2009 Sandhurst Cup, a\ntwo-day military skills competition where West Point cadets competed\nagainst our foreign counterparts from Britain, Canada, Afghanistan and,\nfor the first time, Chile.\n\nIn trying times like these when American blood is spilled on foreign\nsoils in pursuit of lofty ideals such as democracy and freedom, we\nlearn that some things simply don\u0092t carry price tags. Though excess and\nwastefulness certainly aren\u0092t the right answers, there are some things\nwe should never surrender in the name of efficiency or\ncost-effectiveness. How is it that in a time when government is\nspending on programs, infrastructure, and bailouts at an\never-increasing rate, West Point is judged expendable?\n\n\n\nWest Point is a crucible that molds us into leaders of character. We\ncadets forfeit free time and sleep to endure pressures that most\ncollege students would never put up with because we know the payoff\nafter graduation is something that can\u0092t be calculated in dollars\u0097a\nsolid education that will prepare us to lead our nation\u0092s sons and\ndaughters into harm\u0092s way. Douglas MacArthur once noted that \"in war\nthere is no substitute for victory.\" In America there is no substitute\nfor West Point.\n\n\nJust ask the hero of Mr. Ricks\u0092 most recent book \u0097 David Petraeus,\nclass of 1974 West Point graduate.\n\n\nVII.  Dear Tom:\n\n\n\nI read in your piece and in parts of your recent book distillations of\nmany conversations we've had on the subject of officer education. As you\nknow I've been toiling in the fields of educational reform for many\nyears. I also realize that I am responsible sewing the seeds of at least\na few of your opinions. So what follows are some responses most of which\nyou will find familiar.\n\n\n\nI'm uncomfortable with loopers who list their cv's but a few things\nabout my background are important at least to summarize:\n\n*         Eighteen of my thirty five years of service were in TRADOC\nand\nwhat is today NDU. I believe among general officers this is\nunprecedented.\n\n*         After retirement I was president of a successful and large\nprivate university\n\n\n*         I'm a West Point graduate, class of 66, the \"Long Grey\nLine\"\nclass that Rick Atkinson wrote about\n\n\n*         I was an early advocate of the John McCain school of\nacademy\nachievement graduating in the top five percent of the bottom fifth and a\nfirst class sergeant.\n\n\n*         Both of my children graduated from fully funded ROTC\nprograms,\nWake Forest and Notre Dame at my encouragement. I strongly support women\nat West Point but I thought my two daughters would be better\nacculturated to the world by attending a civilian university before\ncommissioning.\n\n\n*         I earned my PhD from Duke on my own and did not teach at\nWest\nPoint.\n\n\n*         I've spent most of the past ten years as an advocate for\nreform in military education working with various committees as well as\nIke Skelton and Steve Israel. So far  my efforts have pretty much\nfailed.\n\n\nNow a summary of our discussions:\n\n\n*         The greatest failures in our current wars have been human\nand\nintellectual not technological.\n\n\n*         As we discussed there seems to be a curious pattern of\nsuccess\namong this intellectual failure in Iraq and Afghanistan. It seems that\nthe many of the most successful general officers share a distinct\nprovenance: they earned a degree in the human sciences and later taught\nat West Point. This includes such men as Petraeus, Chiarelli, Dempsey,\nMcMaster, Eikenberry among many others of lesser rank some of whom are\nloopers.\n\n\n*         It's important to realize how small this field really is.\nThey\ncome from four departments: History, Social Sciences, English and\nBehavioral Sciences and Leadership. So we're talking about a production\nrate of about two dozen per year among all the services.\n\n\n*         Of course there have been many brilliant outliers in the\nlist\nof intellectually gifted. Jim Mattis and Jim Dubik come to mind. But\nmost of these men share the same passion for reading history and\nthinking about the human side of war.\n\n\nSo, Tom, what should we make of all this? Some thoughts:\n\n\n*         The value of the service academies does not come from the\npedagogical pedigree of their faculties or the richness of their\ncurricula. All are top tier schools. But value comes from their ability\nto attract very talented high school students to serve. Were it not for\nthe mystique of the academies few of them would have ever thought about\nservice to the nation. Second, the academies are brilliant at\nsocializing these men and women to the military tribe, a process often\nvery difficult in a liberal democracy. Socialization is vital in many\naspects of military culture: basic training for soldiers and marines;\nranger and airborne schools for combat arms; hell week, selection and\nthe Q course for the special operations community. For bean counters\nthese schools are a needless waste. There really is no pedagogical\njustification for the attrition and lack of relevance of, say, the\nairborne and ranger school merit badges for close combat officers. But\nwe all know intuitively that such schools add value that cannot be\nquantified. I commanded a training brigade in TRADOC so I know first\nhand that military socialization works. But I'm not sure any\npsychologist can explain how and why it works. I jut know we should\ntread very carefully before summarily altering a method that produces\noutstanding results.\n\n\n*         So that's why it's far more important to have a combat\nseasoned young captain or major with an MA teaching cadets rather than a\ncivilian PhD. Doctorates are needed to teach graduate students but not\nfor undergraduates. We have too many civilians and not enough upwardly\nmobile officers on academy faculties particularly in the human sciences.\nWe need to change our criteria to make more not fewer Petraeuses.\n\n\n*         About every 15 years since the early nineteenth century\nprotectors of the republic have attacked the academies with particular\nemphasis on West Point. They view them as threats to the republic, in\nessence tiny bits of Sparta in the midst of Babylon. Many still believe\nthat somehow Jefferson got it wrong in proposing an institution that\nthey believe might threaten our political systems. This of course is\nridiculous. But only such a phenomenon can explain the vitriol that's\nperiodically thrown at these relatively small pieces of our defense\nestablishment.\n\n\nSo Tom the issue is not the service academies or the war colleges for\nthat matter. It's really how to change the techno-centric culture of our\nmilitary so that it's better prepared to fight the irregular wars that\nwill challenge us for a generation. As we discussed one answer is to do\na better job of educating our leaders. But this should be an additive\nrather than an eliminative process. We have the most experienced cadre\nof leaders in our history but these are practical men and women who are\nintellectually levels deep but not terribly broad. Few have had the time\nor the disciplined environment to expand their experiential base. As\nI've said on the loop before we should:\n\n\n*         Change the statutes such that our officers are rewarded\nrather\nthan punished for learning. The enemy here is not the academies but the\nvarious service personnel systems that reward time in the field over\ntime spent in reflective thought and intellectual achievement.  Our\nyoung officers are ambitious. If they perceived that study and academic\nachievement were career enhancing we would not have any problem finding\nacademically qualified candidates to become future Petreauses.\n\n\n*         To make more Petraeuses we should offer every Army and\nMarine\nofficer who completes company command successfully a two year sabbatical\nat a first tier graduate school to study the art of war and alien\ncultures. They should then be fast tracked to GO without having to squat\nin some billet just to meet the statutory requirements for jointness.\n\n\n*         No officer should be promoted to Colonel without\ndemonstrating\nproficiency in a language spoken by potential enemies.\n\n\n*         We should require the PhD degree for all instructors at war\ncolleges and we should give them the time to acquire the degree. We\nshould reward them for teaching through promotion and selection for\ncommand. Again, this is a human resources not an academic problem.\n\n\n*         To achieve such reforms we must increase the proportion of\nofficers on active duty such that we create \"waste\" in the form of more\nman years for study of all sorts: seconding to other federal agencies\nand think tanks; long term attendance at civilian graduate schools;\nattendance at more foreign service schools; time spent with industry and\nas interns in Congress and the NSC. I could go on but you get the\nthought.\n\n\n*         We need a chief learning officer in OSD someone who can\nbalance the insidious damage done by the personnelists who too often\nmake decisions about promotion and education policy antithetical to all\nthe above. He or she should be at the assistant secretary level.\n\n\n*         Promotion boards should see two files, one for duty\nperformance and one for intellectual achievement. Key strategic billets\nin the Joint Staff and NSC should be reserved fro those who pass muster\nfor the latter as well as the former. General officer selection for\nthese key billets should be tied to the intellectual file. A stint as an\ninstructor in any service school should be a prerequisite for selection\nto these billets.\n\n\n\nI could go on but you get the point. My problem with your piece is that\nits incendiary nature might deflect us from the greater task of\nfundamentally reforming how the military learns and rewards those who\nare good at learning.\n\n\n\nPlease don't take offense. Hope we're still friends.\n\n\n\nBob Scales\n\n\n\nVIII. Here is a voice recording that expresses why the Academies will live as\nlong as the Republic.

I'm surprised that such a thread on how to make the most of college isn't here on the College Life forum. I could be wrong, though.\n\nI'm very fortunate to have gotten accepted to Swarthmore and to have the opportunity to go to school here. When people ask me how Swarthmore is, I usually say, \"Great!\" I was a high achiever in high school, and I think I had a reputation of being the one who loved to learn but was also kind of a chill guy who knew how to have fun in his own nerdy, dorky way. I was on the chess team, math team, and Latin \"quiz bowl\" team, and I really enjoyed all of the competitions I went to.\n\nActually, though, it's hard to say that I loved my first year. It seems like all my friends in college are loving college, and it's supposed to be the best four years of your life. Don't get me wrong. I enjoyed freshman year. I learned a lot, and I think I improved a lot on my writing ability and my ability to make an argument and communicate it. I learned a lot of math and Chinese, and I also made some very good friends. These are all good things, but for some reason I don't feel completely satisfied. I'm still trying to find out why.\n\nWe get a lot of work at Swarthmore, and that was really one reason I came here. I wanted to work very hard and get the grade I deserved. But I've found that having too much work is a bad thing. I've often found myself finishing classes, going to the library to work, having dinner, often by myself because I haven't scheduled a time for dinner, and then going back to finish up my work. And the work isn't easy, especially when it's scholarly text. I think one of the things that I never really learned in high school was how to read a textbook. I've used methods like SQ3R and other reading techniques, but I've found some sentences and sometimes whole pages that I can't comprehend even if I work hard, even when I'm working in quiet. I used to join some extracurricular activities, but I got bored of them, and I became worried that I wouldn't have enough time to complete all my work. But now I think that just working is boring and I get lonely. Has anyone had this experience?\n\nI am thinking that forming a study group might be helpful, and joining some club. Usually in my free time I do solitary things, like going for a walk or reading. I also work 8 hours a week for work-study.\n\nI am also starting to think that the courses that I will be taking for the next three years are just courses. In other words, they have no real relation to each other. For example, I took a course in biology, but it was followed by nothing. Here's what I took in first semester:\n\nLinear Algebra\nChinese\nBiology\nModern Germany\n\nand here's what I took second semester:\n\nMultivariable Calculus\nChinese\nEnglish\nModern China\n\nI just don't get a sense that what I'm learning is coherent. I don't really know why I don't feel as satisfied, because they were mostly good classes taught by good professors. All in all, the characteristics of a good academic experience. But none of them really changed my perception of the world or changed any part of me, I don't think. I could be wrong. It seems like I'm learning a lot of information, but I'm not getting any real \"Aha\" moment. I don't get the sense that I've changed at all. I don't feel educated.\n\nWhich brings me to another thing I've reflected on. Many people go to college to get an education. Many people apply to schools like Swarthmore in order to \"get a liberal arts education.\" But I'm starting to think that Swarthmore does not offer an education. Instead, Swarthmore, and college in general, offers schooling. Professors don't educate you; they teach you. What does it mean to be educated?\n\nI was reading a book, Teacher in America, by Jacques Barzun, and here's what he means by educated:\n\n\"When a man has been singled out by the Fates for education, what happens is that he first disgorges all the facts he has learned. He forgets on a really magnanimous scale. It is a spring cleaning in which he sorts out his true intellectual interests from the temporary or imitative.\"\n\nHe then goes on to say,\n\n\"The whole reorganizing of a fine and well-stocked mind may seem a haphazard, uncertain process...it is an instance of thinking in the widest meaning of the term; which means it is the working of a strong wish, early implanted--a passion-- and out of it comes a characteristic work o art--a Person.\"\n\nHe says that education is a result of passion:\n\n\"To become educated is above all things the result of wishful thinking; but the wish must be for the true state, not for its trappings. Wish is in fact too weak a word, so I have called it passion..... every educated man shares their experience--the same toiling over oneself and over subject matter, the same sacrifice of usual pleasures, the same sense of never being satisfied, of never having done, in a span which dwindles as its purpose becomes clearer...it is the educated--and I do not mean the learned--who save novelty from neglect and propagate it, out of live and admiration and pride.\"\n\nEducation, then, is something that is done through the self. It cannot be given. Which makes me wonder whether I will achieve what I have wanted to achieve in college.\n\nWhen I started college, I wanted to learn so many things. I wanted to know about chemistry, physics, biology, political science, economics, a bit of sociology, math, Chinese, the great works of literature. And I wanted to know a lot about history. I've realized that in the short four years, I cannot possible learn all these things as in depth as I wanted to. I guess that I have to pick. Most importantly what I want to get from college are the essential skills of reading, writing, counting, and speaking.\n\nBut I wanted to develop a sense of intellect. You know, we always speak of Swarthmore and the University of Chicago as \"super-intellectual colleges.\" We also speak of Reed in this way. But what does it mean to be intellectual? I honestly don't think I've had many really intellectual conversations since coming to Swarthmore. That might be excused, though. It's hard to talk about Mill if you know so little about him. Now that I think about it, I myself probably cannot have many genuinely intellectual conversations, but that is something I wanted and still want to work on.\n\nIn short, it's hard to say that I had a bad freshman year. I learned a lot, I did get a challenging work load, and I did get the personal attention from professors that the small colleges promise. And I did feel a sense of community. All the good stuff. But I felt that I just took courses in freshman year. I kind of don't feel a great sense of accomplishment. I also feel that I haven't made as much out of college as I could have. Does anyone feel this way or have suggestions?

I have also previously taken three SATII tests with the following results:  800MathI, 800MathII, and 770Spanish (and I expect to take 2 more SATII's in the fall).  I know my SAT scores are great, and I am thankful for them, but I do want to maximize my chances at HYPS.  The argument in favor of retaking is that I'm below the 75th percentile for M (barely) and CR for HYPS, and I don't want to give the schools an incentive to reject me because I will hurt their statistics.  Sadly, it seems from what I have read that, despite the expectable denials from admissions offices, gamesmanship plays a meaningful role in the admissions process at even the best schools.  Based on a few practice tests and my PSAT results (80CR/80M),  I think my chances of increasing both scores (and particularly CR) over 1 or 2 retakes are quite high.  On the con side, I probably wouldn't do quite as well in writing (maybe 750-780 based on other data points), and am also leery of looking like a bit of a perfectionist.  Still, taking the SAT another time or 2 is no big deal for me (and strangely, I actually sort of enjoy these tests), so it's not clear to me what is the right choice.

I don't want to tell you my score because I don't want you to be influenced by what score I received from the graders. This was my first SAT and I had no experience with the essay before, so please suggest improvements.\n\nPrompt: When some people win, must others lose, or are there situations in which everyone wins?\n\nIf you're interested, here's the preamble they gave before the prompt:\n\nWinning does not require people to be against someone else; people can reach their goals through cooperation just as well as they can through competition. Winning is not always the result of selfish individualism. People achieve happiness by cooperating with others to increase the happiness of all, rather than by winning at others' expense. Ours is not a world in which the price of one person's happiness is someone else's unhappiness. Adapted from Gilbert Brim, Ambition\n\nAnd here's my Essay:\n\nThe gain of one person invariably results in the loss of another. As humans, we are inherently self absorbed and often inadvertently reap the benefits of others' losses. This has not only become apparent in everyday life, but also in economics, war, politics and all forms of social interaction.\n\nAn economic theory known as Pareto Optimality states that at social efficiency, an individual is unable to gain without stripping another individual of some of his resources. In other words, even in the most thriving economies where all resources are distributed, we are forced to make compromises and settle for less.\n\nAnother economic example is the merger of the two airline companies Delta and Northwest. What is ostensibly a joining of forces - uniting to gain mutual benefits, where everyone gains - is actually quite different. At the gain of the newly merged powerhouse with greater powerhouse is the loss of smaller airline companies who must compete in the market. Their lack of pricing power as the industry moves towards an oligopoly leads to the loss of their jobs. Thus, someone has suffered for the gain of the merged company.\n\nIn the play 'A View from the Bridge' by Arthur Miller, Alfieri, the commentator, famously states that 'we must settle for half.' We are forced to make compromises because in our self absorbed pursuit of a goal, we hinder the progress of others and often take away what they have. As the protagonist Eddie experiences, we are better off settling for half because if we try to take everything for ourselves it can have grave consequences.\n\nIn conclusion it is inevitable that there will be inequality in our world, and this is due to the stark fact that our gain is someone else's loss.

Parents and lawmakers who favor such laws point to the high incidence of ar accidents with 16 and 17 year old drivers, and claim that not allowing teenagers under 18 to ride together will help newer drivers to focus on driving safely.  Teenagers and parents who are against the restriction argue that teengerrs riding together isn't necessarily the cause of the accidents and that more comprehensive driver training is a better way to reduce accidents.  In your opinion, should cities pass laws that ban teenagers from riding in a car that is driven by a driver under 18?\n\nEssay:\n\nLaws restricting drivers under 18 years of age to drive alone or with parents will not impact the amount of accidents among 16 and 17 yaer olds.  Kids at the age of 16 and 17 are always with friends, so blindly blaming accidents on this fact is quite ignorant.  The real reason for most car accidents that take place between 16 and 17 year olds is because it is then when drivers have the least experience.\n\nSixteen and Seventeen year olds are at their peak of being social.  Most teenagers tend to preform better and feel more comfortable around friends.  Forcing teens to drive alone will only have negative results.  There will be less brain power and eyes in the car, which will result in more frequent accidents.  Afer all, who said that alert passengers haven't actually saved their fellow peers from an accidents?\n\nA very well known saying says \"Practice makes perfect\".  Generally in any situation, the more practice and experience one has at something, the better one will preform.  If accident rates are high in 16 and 17 year olds it is only natural.  The only thing that can be done is to have more practice pushed on to young drivers.  Regardless, drivers will still be the least skilled at young ages.\n\nThe biggest arguement that people have for enforcing this law is that all teen drivers fool around and pay little attention to the road wihle driving.  Statements such as these give false stereotypes to young drivers.  In all age groups distractions occur.  Also, young people are much more alert than elderly people.  If an accident was to take place, a 16 or 17 year old driver will most likely avoid it better than one at an age of seventy years or older.  many young drivers are very catious due to the fact they know that they aren't experienced.\n\nIn Conclusion, laws restricting drivers under 18 years of age to driving alone of with an adult are of no help.  The fact that teenagers are always with freinds leads many to fasely accuse friend passengers for the reason of accidents among begining drivers.  Drivers at the age of 16 and 17 have a lack of experience.  The only solution to this dilemma is to more strictly enforce teens to practice their driving skills.\n\n\nThx. please remember the act graders understand that ur essay is brainstormed in only 30 minutes.  also any help to improve my essay will be greatly appreciated because it helps a lot more than just giving me a number.  ill prolly say what grade i got on the real act if i see ppl are giving me ecentric numbers                "}, {"date": "2009-07-27T13:25:28+00:00", "url": "http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/transfer-students/753961-i-just-want-a-reality-check.html", "messages": "\n                    in high school, I performed quite poorly academically since i spent my time doing research instead of focusing on school work (and I published in a prestigious scientific journal , however that didnt carry over to the admissions officers).

I felt like a failure for not getting into the schools I wanted, I was surrounded by people whose work ethic/goals were pulling me down, and as a result had no motivation to work.

Read at your own risk, unless you don't like that kind of thing, then go read something else.[Disclaimer]\n\nI took my subject tests a while back and got the results somewhat recently. While I was taking them I was seriously thinking about just standing up and walking out of the room (it was that bad), but the results weren't as substandard as I expected.\n\nMath II: 710\nPhysics: 710\n\nI know what you're thinking \"he got a 710, why is this so bad?\". It is \"so bad\" because it was pure luck I did that well and there's no possible way I'm getting better. I literally didn't know the answer to half the questions on the test, or even how some of the physics problems were set up. The worst by far was electricity. Practical electricity is a strength of mine, but the more theoretical questions on the test might as well be written in classical Greek (which I took two years of and still know next to nothing about; it was that or AP Latin).\n\nI studied for these tests like a primate on something illegal, but there's only so much one can do when they are basically homeschooling themselves with only a laptop for company.\nThe high school I go to is extremely liberal arts oriented (my parents want me to go to a religious school) which is bad for an aspiring engineer like me. Can you believe I was actually the first person at my school to take a subject test?\n\nThe \"science department\" at my school consists of one guy who worked at a chemical lab and never even took physics at a college level; I knew more about most concepts than him and had to correct him several times. The math teacher (teacher, singular) is much better. They've managed to find someone who is really good at math (she aced the math section of the SAT and still had half the time left), but she also works a full 40 hour week at another job and so is never around except for two hours every day to teach Trig and zero hour AP calculus. They unload all the other math classes onto the history/literature teacher that drew the short straw that year.\n\nIt always comes back to the \"engineer who doesn't know about science\". I love building stuff, math is my favorite subject (except for science), my personality screams \"enginerd\"  as loud as it can; but I always score lowest on the math and science portions of standardized tests simply because I've never been able to learn them properly (self study is never as good as classroom instruction, at least for me).\n\nI'm just worried colleges will see that trend and think it's because of a lack of talent or dedication. You want to know the worst part; the school I attend is located down the street from a technical charter school, so I get to pull my hair out when I pass it twice daily.\n\nAlright, the rant switch firmly secured in the off position (the irony needle is still pegged though, I broke off that switch a long time ago). Make of it what you will. Maybe you empathize for me, or are even in a similar position (doubtful); maybe you just want to tell me to suck it up and get a life. Even if this post doesn't get any replies I'll sleep easier knowing I got it off my chest (weird saying that, wonder if some ancient guy somewhere got a giant mosquito attatched to his chest or something).\n\nThe End\n\nP.S.

Let me be clear, by 'inclusivity' I am referring to the degree to which different racial and socioeconomic groups actually meaningfully interact, not statistical diversity. This thread is intended to be descriptive, rather than prescriptive. Personal biases tend to detract, rather than add, to constructive discourse.\n\nI'll begin.\n\nAs a minority male upperclassman, I have had the privilege of experiencing firsthand social interactions between different \"groups\" of students at Williams. The central issue surrounding inclusivity (or lack thereof) at Williams, I believe, is the disparity between different racial and socioeconomic sections of the student population. Williams, like other elite institutions of higher learning, has lost its racial homogeneity in the decades following educational integration and the inception of affirmative action policies. Unlike other institutions, however, Williams' undergraduate student body numbers a mere 2,000. The result is carefully partitioned groups of students that share little in common.\n\nSimply put, Williams lacks a large enough \"middle section\" of middle class ($50,000 and below) students that, despite racial differences, possess commonalities that create the 'glue' that allows students to feel comfortable enough to pursue intimate social interactions. The tendency at Williams is to avoid that which might expose one to social criticism, with the result being a social chasm between different social groups.\n\nWhen I visit the campus of my local state university (an institution with an undergraduate population numbering 15,000) , I do not feel that such a chasm exists. While there are certainly instances of extreme intolerance (this same campus was the site of a nationally covered racial incident 2 years ago), such incidents reflect the views of individuals rather than those of wide cross-sections of the student body.\n\nBut, let's dig a bit deeper. With regard to such sensitive issues as inter-racial relationships, views on affirmative action, etc., the chasm that divides the student population at Williams widens. When I go on walks with white female friends at Williams, I see and feel the \"unsureness\" of passersby that creates a palpable tension. In addition, the sexual exotification of black males in particular, leads me to believe that some Williams students carry deep-seated misperceptions of who, and how, a minority student is, and should, behave.\n\nAfter the racial incident my freshman year, in which a racial slur was sprayed across an entry door, there was a decided gulf in the reaction of the student body that produced a split between those who advocated for a social honor code, and those who went as far as to advocate against it. As the rallying cry was \"Stand With Us!\", a small cadre of students responded with the corollary \"Or Against Us?\", indicating that one did not have to voice one's opposition to intolerance to be 'against' intolerance. To me, this indicates a degree of complicity with regard to the specific incident that mirrors social attitudes at Williams - not only does no one seem to care about the divide between race and class that exists here, but no one condemns it, as well.\n\nSo, that's my perspective. Yours?

Tilghman. . . . (continued)\n\n\nThe returns are in and Princeton's endowment has taken a tumble along with its peers.  The situation for all of them is, however, much better than it looked in December of 2008 when each of them had lost a great deal more.  Princeton's endowment benefited greatly from remaining in the market during the rapid improvement in equities last spring but it still suffered from significant losses in its less liquid assets.\n\nThe four largest university endowments in the country belong to Harvard, Yale, Princeton and Stanford.  Here is a comparison of how they fared this last fiscal year.\n\n\nRanked by Size of Endowment:\n\nInstitution\n\nCurrent Value\n\nEndowment Last Year---% Change\n\nHarvard\n\n$26.0 billion\n\n$36.9 billion\n\n29.5% drop\n\nYale\n\n$16.3 billion\n\n$22.9 billion\n\n28.8% drop\n\nPrinceton\n\n$12.6 billion\n\n$16.3 billion\n\n22.7% drop\n\nStanford\n\n$12.6 billion\n\n$17.2 billion\n\n26.7% drop\n\n\n\nRanked by Smallest Drop to Largest Drop in Endowment Size:\n\nPrinceton\n\n22.7% drop\n\nStanford\n\n26.7% drop\n\nYale\n\n28.8% drop\n\nHarvard\n\n29.5% drop\n\n\nThe drop in the size of the endowment is not the same as the investment return.  The total percent change in the size of the endowment is a combination of investment return plus all additions to the endowment (i.e. gifts) minus all withdrawals of capital from the endowment.  If we look at actual investment returns for these four largest endowments they are ranked as follows.\n\n\nRanked by Best Investment Return to Worst Return\n\nPrinceton\n\nnegative 23.7% return\n\nYale\n\nnegative 24.6% return\n\nStanford\n\nnegative 25.9% return\n\nHarvard\n\nnegative 27.3% return\n\n\nOf these four schools, only Princeton decided not to withdraw funds from its endowment last year.  The belief was that selling investments at the bottom of the market would be a bad idea so it increased its debt through issuing one billion dollars in bonds.  That money, plus a reduction in expenses, allowed the university to avoid liquidating any of its investments under duress.  All of the other three schools also borrowed by issuing debt.  Harvard borrowed 2.5 billion dollars from the capital markets, Yale borrowed about 1.5 billion and both Princeton and Stanford borrowed 1.0 billion.  The other three schools chose to continue spending from their endowments even in the face of the downturn with the result that the drop in the size of their endowments was significantly greater than their investment losses.\n\nNow, theoretically, a university could borrow against its endowment up to close to the value of that endowment, greatly increasing its debt but leaving the size of the endowment unchanged.  It would appear that a school had a very large endowment but it would be an illusion as that endowment would be offset by the debt it was carrying.  For this reason, it is probably more revealing to consider the total market value of each endowment minus the debt that the institution has taken on.  Accounting for the additional debt reveals a very different picture.\n\n\nCurrent Value of Endowment Minus Total Current Bond Debt\n\nHarvard\n\n($26.0 billion - $6.6 billion) =  $19.4 billion\n\nYale\n\n($16.3 billion - $4.6 billion ) = $11.7 billion\n\nPrinceton\n\n($12.6 billion - $2.5 billion ) = $10.1 billion\n\nStanford\n\n($12.6 billion - $2.5 billion ) = $10.1 billion\n\n\nThe figures for Princeton and Stanford are identical now.  Each has an endowment of about $12.6 billion and bond debt of about $2.5 billion and each is now tied for third place in this group.\n\nWhat a change!\n\nAfter reporting years of dramatic growth, each of these four large endowments suffered serious plunges.  Each of them has insisted that it is better off having followed this investment strategy as each is far ahead of where it would have been using a different investing approach.  This argument seems convincing but it will be very painful to deal with the reductions necessary to manage their finances in the coming years.\n\nThere are other hidden problems as well.  Each school has capital commitments that it has made to private equity firms that require it to make additional investments in the future as needed by the equity firms.  This is not a small burden.  In Harvard's case it is between 25% and 30% of the entire size of its current endowment.  These additional required investments could cause severe cash shortages for these institutions in the future.\n\nThe largest endowments seem to have fared the worst this year (even as they fared the best in previous years).  Here's a look at the returns for the rest of the Ivy League.  Penn was the winner here (if any of these results can be described as \"winning\"!) with the lowest total percentage loss.\n\n\nIvy League Endowment Changes From Best to Worst\n\nPenn\n\n15.7% drop to about $5.25 billion\n\nColumbia\n\n19.7% drop to about $5.7 billion\n\nPrinceton\n\n22.7% drop to about $12.6 billion\n\nCornell\n\n26.0% drop to about $4.0 billion\n\nBrown\n\n26.6% drop to about $2.04 billion\n\nYale\n\n28.8% drop to about $16.3 billion\n\nHarvard\n\n29.5% drop to about $26.0 billion\n\n\nThe bottom line on all of this is that among the largest endowments, Princeton did extremely well.  Among the Ivies, it was about in the middle.

However , the jury rules against Tom and he is sent to prison. He dies in prison shortly. This may seem as a complete failure to Atticus. However , it isn't a complete failure . Even when it looks like the entire pursuit has been futile , it isnt totally in vain because all the people of Maycombe county were sensitised to race issues because of Atticus' brave attempt to defend an african american.

Many of them may end in failure. Sometimes , success may never be attained at all . In the end, however , the entire process serves as a learning experience.

This is not about who is going to replace him. This is about our leaving our posts. You think anybody will stay after he leaves?\u201d\n\nMr. Abbas warned last week that he would not participate in elections he called for January. But he has threatened several times before to resign, and many viewed this latest step as a ploy by a Hamlet-like leader upset over Israeli and American policy. Many also noted that the vote might not actually be held, given the Palestinian political fracture and the unwillingness of Hamas, which controls Gaza, to participate.\n\nIn the days since, however, his colleagues have come to believe that he is not bluffing. If that is the case, they say, the Palestinian Authority could be endangered.\n\nFour top officials made the same point in separate interviews.

Buzzing around my ears were conversations in an unfamiliar language that intrigues me. It then struck me that after twenty hours of a perpetual plane ride that I finally arrived in The United States of America, a country full of new opportunities.  It was this moment that I realized how diverse and big this world is.  This is the story of my new life in America.\nA mere two weeks passed by since the day of my arrival to my new home before the start of second grade. I struggle to learn basic phrase before the start of school, phrases such as \u0093May I use the restroom?\u0094 and \u0093What is this?\u0094 After timeless tries, my aunt, who already knows English, came up with an idea to write the phrases down on pieces of papers. I would have to hand the teacher pieces of paper which matches to what I needed in order to communicate with her. The idea makes me feel embarrassed, but knowing that it\u0092s the only way possible for me to get my needs to my teacher, I agreed to the plan.\nDays after days, weeks after weeks, my fellow classmates would laugh at me whenever I took a piece of paper out from my bag saying I needed something. After so many incidents, I\u0092m determined with myself to learn this foreign language and prove to people that I\u0092m not lost in this country. Every day afterschool I would ask my family to help me with my English.

School came to me as an enjoying part of my day, something I look forward to when going to bed, and it\u0092s an opportunity, a gift for me to learn the language of this new country.\nAn event that happened in fifth grade, one that really shaped the way I am. It was the Math Is Cool competition. I was a very shy person, afraid of people around me and dare not to work with anyone. My classmate knew that I excel at math and wanted me to be a part of their team. Time passes by and it\u0092s getting closer and closer to the first practice for the competition. A part of me wants to be a part of the team, but a bigger part of me says no because I\u0092m too shy. Every day, my classmate would try and talk me into it. After some time, I finally gave in and gave myself a try. After many practices, it was time for the actual competition.\nIt was a Friday evening, our team gathered before the competition starts in a couple of minutes. We all gave good lucks to one another and off we are to the competition. After what seems like days, it was the award ceremony, we are able to see our results. The results didn\u0092t look very good to us; we didn\u0092t even make it to top 10. Our team is disappointed, but happy at the same time. We are happy because we were able to work as a team and have fun. Something that seems impossible for me to do, but I did it. I overcome my fear of people.\nIf there was one thing that I should learn from that competition, it was the value of teamwork. Each one of us is not perfect, but we are good at something. When all of us work together, that something becomes one, and that\u0092s when real knowledge appears. From that day on, I value the chances to work with people. Pursuing personal knowledge is wonderful, but sharing that knowledge with people and learning from them is even greater. It was then that I realize to myself that my greatest joy is working with people.

Consider University of Chicago. I offer this hypothetical as an example of what happens at college/university generally. What I'm going to say here about University of Chicago could be said about every college/university in the country.\n\nChicago is an excellent school, ranked 9th in the nation (out of 1800 college/university). Each year, Chicago has an entering class of about 2000 college/university students. For those 2000 seats in its first-year college/university class, Chicago receives over 29,000 applications. About 2,100 (8%) of the 29,000 applicants will be admitted, since some people will be accepted at many college/university and will turn down Chicago's offer of admission.\n\nNow, imagine that I'm a member of the Admissions Committee at University of Chicago. My job on the Admissions Committee is to accept only those applicants about whom I can make a reasonable prediction of satisfactory performance in college/university. But how can I make such a prediction? What information about an applicant will most reliably tell me he or she will succeed in college/university?\n\nIf I look at personal statements, for example, most of those will try to convince me that a given applicant will be the best college/university student anyone could ever want. That is, it's highly unlikely a personal statement will reveal anything about an applicant except the most flattering information. And the same can be said about letters of recommendation.\n\nSo, after looking at the essay and letters of recommendation, I'm still left with the same 29,000 applications with which I began.\n\nHow do I weed out all but the most promising 2,100?\n\nSuppose I look at high school grade point averages. They indeed might give me some reliable information. How a person has performed academically in the past might accurately predict how he or she will do in the future. So I might adopt a strategy of first admitting all those people with 4.0 GPAs and then work backward from 4.0 until the entering college/university class is filled.\n\nBut there's a problem with this strategy. The 29,000 applicants have attended more than 700 different high schools in the United States and abroad. How do I know that a 4.0 GPA at one high school represents the same level of academic achievement as a 4.0 at another high school? One High school might have very high academic standards, while another might not. So an \"A\" at one school is not the same as an \"A\" somewhere else. Also, one student with a 4.0 GPA might have taken non-challenging classes, while another 4.0 student from the same high school may have taken a more rigorous curriculum. So, two 4.0 GPAs of students from the same school may not represent comparable academic achievements. Thus, even using GPA, I can't be 100% sure about selecting the incoming college/university class.\n\nWhat else is left? The College/university Admissions Test (SAT/ACT). This is an examination every college/university applicant must take, which is graded uniformly across all applicants. Scores on the SAT/ACT range from a low of 1600 to a high of 2400. In other words, a person can take the SAT/ACT and get all the questions wrong, but still receives a score of 1600. Another person getting all the questions right receives a 2400.\n\nIn theory, the SAT/ACT is a consistent measure for an admissions officer to compare all 29,000 applicants with each other.\n\nIndeed, look at how much University of Chicago relies on the SAT/ACT. The information below represents the SAT/ACT scores for those applicants to University of Chicago recently who had a 3.5 GPA or better. In other words, these are the most promising applicants in terms of their academic performance in college.\nSAT/ACT Score        Percent Admitted\n168-180                  100%\n164-167                    99%\n160-163                    71%\n156-159                    15%\n148-155                    12%\n120-147                      4%\n\nThese statistics clearly reveal how important the SAT/ACT is to college/university-school admissions.\n\nNow consider some national statistics. Of all people who apply to college/university nationally, about 55 to 60 percent are accepted at one or more schools. In other words, about 40 percent of all applicants to college/university aren\u0092t able to go because they aren\u0092t admitted anywhere.\n\nIn comparison, of all applicants to college/university from the urban public university where I teach, about 30 to 35 percent are accepted at one or more schools. In other words, almost two out of three applicants to college/university from the City University of New York (and other colleges and universities like it) are rejected everywhere they apply.\n\nWhy do public college and university students not have as much success getting into college/university as students nationally? Remember that the national average includes students attending elite colleges and universities like University of Chicago and University of Chicago, where 80 or 90 percent or more of their students are accepted to college/university. Thus, the national average is just that \u0096 an average.\n\nSo what should public college and university students who want to go to college/university do? Change schools? Those who can be admitted to a University of Chicago or a University of Chicago and can afford the annual cost of $35,000 or more to go there may be well advised to do just that. But most public college and university students don\u0092t have that option. Also, transferring to another public college or university won\u0092t help much because many public schools (as well as private ones) don\u0092t have substantially better success in college/university-school admission than CUNY.\n\nKeep in mind that a significant number of public college and university graduates do in fact go on to college/university. The point is that those students who want to go to college/university need to be careful, especially with regard to the SAT/ACT. Earning a high GPA isn\u0092t enough. As the University of Chicago statistics indicate, even those with a 3.5 GPA or better who don\u0092t do well on the SAT/ACT have only about a four-percent chance of admission.\n\nConsider some additional statistics. The average score nationally on the SAT/ACT is about 152. That is what\u0092s known as the 50th percentile. Differently stated, half of all people taking the SAT/ACT across the nation receive a score of 152 or higher. The average score for CUNY students taking the SAT/ACT is about 142. Now, at just 10 points below 152, 142 doesn\u0092t seem like much of a difference from the national average. But the important comparison is between percentiles. An SAT/ACT score of 142 is about the 20th percentile. In other words, approximately 80 percent of all people taking the test around the country do better than 142.\n\nThus, the big problem for most public college and university students who want to go to college/university is performing well on the SAT/ACT. How can students prepare for it?\n\nThe SAT/ACT doesn\u0092t measure knowledge about the college/university or other legal matters. So taking college/university-related classes (like business college/university or constitutional college/university or criminal college/university) doesn\u0092t necessarily prepare students better for the SAT/ACT than other courses. Rather, the test is designed to measure people\u0092s ability to think critically and analytically, because that\u0092s what a successful career in college/university and in the practice of college/university requires.\n\nSome years ago, a survey was sent to college/university-school deans (the \u0093presidents\u0094 of college/university). One of the questions on the survey was what majors the deans recommended students have in college in order to prepare effectively for college/university. The four majors most frequently recommended by college/university-school deans were (in alphabetical order) English (sometimes called literature), history, philosophy, and political science (sometimes called government). Thus, my recommendation to those students wanting to go to college/university is that they major in one of those fields. Moreover, if English turns out not to be the major selected, then it should be considered seriously as a minor because writing well is absolutely essential to success in the college/university.\n\nMore generally, I advise students to take the most demanding courses with the most demanding professors, because they are the ones who will help develop the analytical thinking skills so necessary for success on the SAT/ACT.\n\nThere's no way to prepare for the substance of the SAT/ACT. But one can prepare for it procedurally by developing familiarity with its format through taking practice exams based on actual questions asked in past SAT/ACTs. One ought not to be surprised when taking the SAT/ACT by the kinds of questions asked. The general type of question asked can be familiar to you by taking an SAT/ACT-preparation course or by means of the practice books available at bookstores.\n\nSAT/ACT-prep courses may improve exam performance \u0096 although some scholars question whether there's evidence of a reliable connection between coaching and test results. Nonetheless, the classes are expensive, costing up to $1,000 or more. People who teach the courses think the coaching is particularly helpful to students who are not self-disciplined and need the structure of a class. Yet students who are focused may do just as well with practice books (Cracking the SAT/ACT by the Princeton Review is highly regarded) and the official SAT/ACT tests that include the explanations of answers to questions. Often, taking timed practice exams isn't enough in itself. Students should also understand how and why they make mistakes on the test. In any event, be aware that effective studying for the SAT/ACT usually takes at least 50 hours.\n\nEqually important is your psychological and emotional preparation for the exam. Take it at a time when other stresses in your life are at a minimum. If you walk into the SAT/ACT with the attitude, \"What I do today will affect the rest of my life! Oh, my God!\" then you'll not do as well as when you're cool and collected.\n\nSome people who take the SAT/ACT and don't do as well as they would like decide to take it again. If they improve their performance the second time around, they think the first score doesn't count. That's not necessarily true. My understanding is that many college/university will average the two scores, and as a result, the earlier, lower score does in fact count to some degree. So I don't recommend you take the exam with the expectation that the first time will be just a trial run for a later, more serious round.\"\"                "}, {"date": "2009-11-24T22:35:15+00:00", "url": "http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/transfer-students/815853-i-need-a-serious-reality-check.html", "messages": "\n                    in high school, I performed quite poorly academically since i spent my time doing research instead of focusing on school work (and I published in a prestigious scientific journal , however that didnt carry over to the admissions officers). As a result of this I did not get into the colleges I wanted to.\n\nIn college, my first semester was HORRID...a 2.3 gpa. It was all my fault. I felt like a failure for not getting into the schools I wanted, I was surrounded by people whose work ethic/goals were pulling me down, and as a result had no motivation to work. Later during that semester, my grandfather had a lethal heart attack and my family was in a state of shock. This trauma also got to me and had me worried about what was going to happen.\n\nMy second semester improved slightly (a 3.0) but still nowhere near what I wanted to get. Over this break I realized that if I want to make my dreams come true, I have to stop dwelling in the past and work towards the future. The problem is that I think (actually I kinda know) its too late in the process for me to come back. My dream school is .Cornell. I know its WAY out of reach at this point since even if I manage to get a 4.0 next sem, my total gpa will only be a 3.2. The realistic voice in me has absolutely no desire to spend $70 for a rejection letter. The other part of me however, has a desire to apply. I just want a reality check. I know things didn't turn out the way I wanted too. I'm just trying to convince myself to settle for less even though thats not what I want...

Several examples from our modern world clearly demonstrates that world's progression is not toward the positive side of way.\n\nAs wee see from recent war between U.S and Iraq, circumstances in the Earth are becoming less and less favorable for mankind, in this case for muslims citizens of Iraq and American soldiers functioning there. Everyday, we hear heartbreaking news about bombs blasting in every city and every street of Iraq giving end to hundreds or even thousands of lives of innocent people just because of mismanagement in internal affairs and several other political errors made by country. According to the Opinion Research Business survey, casualty number in Iraq war has reached the 1,220,000 by the end of 2007. Therefore,it would be absolutely wrong to think the Earth's nowadays as the flourishing times for humanity.\n\nAnother reason of world's negative advance is the global warming caused by continuous release of greenhouse gases since the Industrial Revolution. Global warming results from excessive accumulation of greenhouse,which are normally present in the atmosphere and function as heat retainers in order to stabilize temperature on Earth. These gases, including carbon dioxide and nitric oxide, are discharged steadily from various factories from all over the world and enhance the greenhouse effect by furthering heat built-up in the atmosphere.Consequences of global warming are indeed significant for life on Earth; for instance,they change climate patterns and result in glacial melting which can considered as serious threat to life.  So, continuous broadening in impact areas of global warming doesn't give positive insights about fate of the Earth in the future.\n\nAfter careful analysis of global warming and Iraq war, it can be easily concluded that current trends in the don't give us hints to think of promising future for the Earth, at least for next few decades.\n\n\nNote: Yup, you can some traces of \"how to write 12 essay in 10 days\" in my essay,but i don't think this one would get 12 in the actual exam. :D "}, {"date": "2009-12-14T19:20:10+00:00", "url": "http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/university-california-berkeley/828347-how-accurate-is-this.html", "messages": "\n                    Well I was bored and decided to read about Berkeley. This review has scared the hell out of me.\nIf I lived in CA I wouldn't care, but I'm oos so now I'm not so sure I'd be willing to pay such a high price. Opinions?\n\nAt UC Berkeley, your tuition will be low, but you will pay a high price for a substandard education in numerous other ways. Your required classes will be oversubscribed or not offered; the professors will not want to meet with you; and the administration will be an endless source of aggravation. Nevertheless, UC Berkeley consistently tops the college rankings. What is going on?\n\nIn the 1960?s, Berkeley was one of the best funded universities across the globe. Tuition was free, and it attracted the best faculty in the world. Starting in the 1970?s, state funding for public higher education steadily eroded. California?s voters chose to provide welfare to corporations (Proposition 13) over support for higher education. The decline in funding has forced UC Berkeley to turn itself into a research center for hire. Lucrative research contracts pay professors? salaries and help maintain the libraries. Teaching does not bring in money like research, so it is all but neglected. Students are forced to teach themselves. UC Berkeley cannot afford to have good teaching.\n\nTo exacerbate matters, budget cuts in Fall 2009 forced the administration to shut the main library one day per week. Course offerings were reduced; class sizes increased; and faculty and staff were forced to take unpaid furlough. Since then, a parents group has funded the re-opening of the library, but the financial situation has not improved.\n\nIf you can afford to go to a private school, then you will probably get a much better education there. But if you insist on attending UC Berkeley, you will be better off knowing the following: life at Berkeley is a matter of survival. Professors know that their tenure guarantees them lifelong employment. Their next increase in salary depends mainly on their research as measured by the number of academic publications that they churn out. As a result, research is their focus, and teaching is neglected. Students waste their time in classes because professors do not want to teach them. They are poorly taught and painful to endure.\n\nProfessors play tricks to minimize their teaching workload. In the Mechanical Engineering Department, one professor decided that he did not want to answer questions about homework during his office hours, so when students stopped by, he later publicly humiliated them in class. That set the tone for the semester. After the midterm exam, he called his students his ?worst ever?. At the end of the semester, this same professor decided that he did not want to correct final exams, so he signaled his intention to fail half the class, causing a mass exodus to drop the course. Another professor shirked his teaching responsibilities by giving everybody A?s. He did not correct any homework, projects, or reports. He never even returned one assignment. Students who came to Berkeley to be taught by experts at the top of their fields were shortchanged. The truth is: professors cannot be bothered to do their jobs. They care only about their research, and not one bit about their students who distract them from their research contracts.\n\nGraduate students endure the worst abuse at UC Berkeley. Often in the sciences and in engineering, students are admitted with promises of financial support, but when they arrive, the support disappears. This bait and switch is only too common. Then you are stuck. You are on your own without funding, and you must wait a year to transfer to another university. They have got you! Unfortunately, this happens regularly. You will need several additional semesters or even years to complete your degree because you will be working as an indentured servant (graduate student instructor) in order to support yourself.\n\nDoctoral students also have to deal with the qualifying exams, which would be okay if the faculty would act like adults. They really do not want to give up a half day of their time to spend on your qualifying exam, so they play games to get out of it. For example, they may not give you an appointment to discuss the qualifying exam. Alternately, they may indicate their intention to sacrifice you during the exam if you ask them to be on your qualifying exam committee. Even if a professor agrees to serve on your committee, there is no guarantee that the faculty member will actually show up despite months advance notice and numerous reminders in person and by email. Professors at UC Berkeley are simply not penalized for their unprofessional behavior.\n\nIf you are a graduate student who already has a Masters Degree and you want to do a PhD at UC Berkeley, then you are sadly mistaken if you think that you will finish up in a few years. Depending on the department, UC Berkeley may not even recognize your Masters Degree. Figure this out before you matriculate! UC Berkeley does not advertise its academic arrogance in any brochure or online. You may be permitted to transfer in one or two classes from elsewhere, but it takes 7 or 8 classes for a Masters, so transferring midstream to UC Berkeley adds one or two more years to your PhD. Students with a Masters who want a PhD should just finish the PhD elsewhere. If you really want to come to Berkeley, then do a postdoc. But really, you?ll be better off elsewhere.\n\nUC Berkeley does not have a big enough budget to keep its main library open, much less retain its best professors. The top talent receives offers to go teach elsewhere such as Stanford., who can afford to pay the best people a top salary. Those professors left at UC Berkeley are ?well?not the best. And they know it. And they are not happy.\n\n?US News and World Report? consistently ranks UC Berkeley among the top universities, yet it does not include teaching as a criterion. Rather, the opinion of other university presidents, provosts, and deans are the most heavily weighted factor. In other words, it is a popularity contest. This ranking system allows UC Berkeley to hide its poor teaching and perpetuate the high rankings.\n\nThe UC Berkeley Administration goes to great lengths to hide how poor the teaching is. Teaching evaluation results are withheld from students in order to suppress how bad the teaching is. This practice clearly violates the California Public Records Act, which authorizes public access to them, but the university is largely immune from lawsuits. Knowing this, UC abuses its legal right to police itself.\n\nHow is it possible that the teaching is so bad? Only competent students are admitted, and they manage to survive. It may, however, require many years longer than anticipated to graduate. Often students get flushed away due to the poor teaching and are never heard from again. Students are no match for faculty apathy, infighting, and numerous mistakes on exams. Whenever issues arise, the student?s career will always be sacrificed so that the faculty members do not have to confront one another. Due to the tenure system, professors cannot be fired. Since they are stuck with each other for life, incompetence flourishes because they would rather not challenge each other. Students pay the price for this system. Undergraduates have no idea how bad the teaching is at UC Berkeley relative to other institutions because they lack a reference for comparison. The graduate students, on the other hand, have figured it out, and they are treated as disposable servants.\n\nIn summary, at UC Berkeley one can only expect a substandard education. You get what you pay for. The tuition would be as expensive as any private university if frustration were a currency. Don?t be fooled by the nice weather and pretty campus ? in your fight for survival, you won?t spend that much time enjoying it. If you can afford to attend college elsewhere, you will likely get a much better education there. Studying at UC Berkeley may just be the biggest that you ever make.

Now, I have decided to pursue my education in one of the best American universities, \u0085 university. I am applying for admission to master program of Mechanical Engineering since I want a career in the research of biomedical engineering and biofluid mechanics.\nDuring high school, I found Chemistry, Mathematics and physics stimulating. Due to my deep interest in Chemistry, I participated in Iran\u0092s national Chemistry Olympiad competition and managed to win gold medal. As one of the four finalists, further participated in and finally managed to win bronze medal in 38th international Chemistry Olympiad, one of the advantages of which was the exemption from compulsory military service after graduation.\nDue to my desire to solve medical problems and enhance treatment techniques, which stems from studying biotechnology course, during preparation courses for participation in international chemistry Olympiad; I selected Mechanical engineering specifically for bioengineering, as one of its areas of research.\nInitially at the early stages of undergraduate study, I had this vivid goal that I should pursue a career in biomedical engineering in industry or as a researcher at university.\nMy first opportunity to enter the world of biomedical engineering was during studying the course \u0093fluid mechanics II\u0094. In this course, I conducted a research into how blood flow pattern changes in the right and left coronary arteries, before and after anesthesia, during coronary artery bypass graft (CABG). To do this research, I read avidly some papers and medical physiology books about this type of surgery. Actually, I believed that my work will be sometimes useful for treatment of cardiovascular diseases. I realized that mechanical engineers could help physicians and surgeons tremendously, to improve treatment techniques. In fact, application of my knowledge of fluid mechanics in solving medical problems, like cardiovascular diseases, moved me.\nDuring studying the course \u0093mechanics of biofluid\u0094, I gained a first hand experience of fluid mechanics application in bioengineering. I became familiar with subjects like blood flow characteristics in cardiovascular arteries, cardiovascular physiology, mass transport in lungs, etc. For the term project, I decided to conduct a research into how to calculate temperature distribution around cancerous and adjacent normal tissues, during magnetic fluid hyperthermia treatment. I did this research with one of my friends and we used a new numerical approach to solve pennes\u0092 bioheat transfer equation. Furthermore, we proved reliability of our results by comparing with experimental studies and showed how the treatment techniques could be enhanced by changing thermodynamic parameters of the tumor tissues. This work is recently submitted as a research paper to the journal of \u0093international communication in heat and mass transfer\u0094. To gather information for this research, I became familiar with new methods of cancer therapy, specifically, hyperthermia. I believe that I should continue my work in cancer therapy, or treatment of cardiovascular diseases because of my strong background information to these subjects and also my great enthusiasm to solve medical problems with the use of my knowledge in fluid mechanics and even chemistry and biology. Therefore I decided to apply for graduate study to gain more experienc\nI passed my summer training course in Research Center for Science and Technology in Medicine (RCSTIM), located in Imam Khomeini hospital in Tehran. I worked there with a researcher who invented an ultrasonic bone saw, which had great advantages over ordinary ones, especially due to piezoceramic materials used in its design and also an Msc student. This training course was a window of opportunity for me to enter the world of bio-instrumentation. My work there was to find effective parameters that could improve the efficiency of the device. We used finite element modeling to show the distribution of the energy exerted to a glass of water by the device and which factor is more important to consider for its design. Our work is under publication and we hope to submit our results as a research paper to an ISI journal.\nThere are some specific research issues that I like to be involved in such as biofluid mechanics, heat transfer enhancement, cancer therapy, treatment of cardiovascular diseases, bio-instrumentation or even biomechanics. I am sure that \u0085 university with its high number of faculties supplying instructive and innovative projects and various labs with wide and state-of-the-art experimental and computational facilities and diagnostic tools in these areas would provide me with essential knowledge and skills to start and develop a successful career in academia or industry. I hope your institution give me the opportunity to show my research and academic skills. I look forward to shaping my career in the halls of \u0085 university.

BUT AS COLUMBIA LEARNED in the late 1990s, when you break that single-digit barrier, the whiz-kid applicants take a fresh look at you, there's a buzz, and BUZZ REAPS RESULTS in the applicant pool.\n\nYour skepticism is well founded.\nThe admissions staff hasn't grown in the period (2007 to 2009) that Brown's application number has grown by perhaps 35 percent (21K to 28K-plus). And those 19 officers were already overworked in 2007.\nTheir new workload will of necessity mean that new procedures have been implemented, which we may call \"triage.\"\nThe old Brown approach -- which made the admissions office the most famously idiosyncratic in the country -- was the \"diamonds in the rough\" approach. Also known as the \"Brown fit\" approach. And that approach resulted in the most diversely creative student body in the country from roughly 1975 to 1998.\n\nExactly right.\nThe new \"triage\" procedure of an understaffed admissions committee involves short-shrifting the \"diamonds in the rough\" applicants. It instead imposes a \"fast culling of the numerically measurable\" approach, i.e. test scores and the like.\nBut this new \"triage\" nicely fits into the \"US News driven\" approach that Brown is desperately in need of, as it has seen its US News ranking plunge from 8th to 16th since the mid-1990s.\nSo everybody's happy. Admissions officers employing the new \"triage\" can quickly cull the low-scoring apps and reduce the tall stack on their desk. And the Brown development office is happy because at long last Brown is pursuing the US News-driven strategy that worked so well for Columbia and Penn ten years ago.\n\nIt is indeed literally \"superficial\" but that's the political reality on campus these days.\nHowever, there's an urgent new consideration that's entered the calculation.\nIn the year 2040 the United States will be majority Hispanic, Asian, and black (in that order of proportionality). By 2055 the United States will be predominately a Hispanic country, with Spanish its core broadcast, electronic, and print language.\nAlso, by 2040 China and Indo-Asia will have larger world influence than the US (China by far, but Indo-Asia also).\nFarsighted US universities are right now positioning themselves as pioneer solicitors of Hispanic, Chinese, and Indo-Asian communities.\n(The losers in this trend are, as ever, the African-Americans, who will fare just as badly under a Hispano-Asian majority.)\nBottom line: Brown's class of 2014 gets 9.8 acceptance rate, significantly higher standardized tests profile, more Hispanics and Asians, but also more rich Europeans.\nAnd, to my satisfaction, more students from England (fallout from Watson), because, hey, that's my ethnicity.

So, copy paste the prior post's list and add your own.  :)\n\nIf you want to expand upon an existing tip...insert your tip and number it with an alpha  (see example after #2).  If you're adding an acronym, just add it in the right place.  :)\n\n\n\nJunior Parents......Things to start doing or learning about NOW... :)\n\n1.  Converse with your spouse and determine how much you can afford to contribute to your child's education.\n\n2.  If your child has a non-custodial parent (NCP), then find out how much he/she will contribute.\n\na.  Determine whether the NCP will be willing to fill out any requested NCP info (which may include the NCP's spouse's info.)\n\nb.  If the NCP refuses to contribute or will contribute far less than he can afford, then your child may need to avoid applying to schools that require NCP info.\n\n3.  Find out what your Expected Family Contribution (EFC) is.  If that number is not affordable, then you need to develop a strategy with your child to get college costs covered.\n\n4.  If merit scholarships are desirable, start researching which schools offer them and what stats are required or likely required.  Many schools don't give merit scholarships, and some publics don't give much to out-of-state schools.\n\n5.  If need-based Financial Aid (FA) is needed, then understand that most public schools do not meet need for out of state students.  Most state schools cannot meet the need of their own resident students, therefore they can't meet need of the high costs for OOS students.  Virginia and NC are exceptions.\n\n6.  Even if you think that your child won't need any financial aid, have your child apply to 2-3 financial safety schools that your child likes.  Family financial situations can quickly change because of job loss, asset loss, or sudden divorce.\n\n7.  ????\n\n\n\nSome acronyms or \"short-speak\" to know....\n\nCOA - Cost of attendance (tuition, room, board, books, fees, travel, misc, personal expenses.)\n\nCC - sometimes means College Confidential and sometimes means community college.  It will be apparent within context.\n\nEFC - Expected Family Contribution (the amount that FAFSA determines that your family should contribute that year for the student's education - whether it's affordable or not.)  An EFC does not limit what you'll have to pay, since most colleges cannot meet need.  Many colleges can only give small amounts of fed grants (which only go to low-income) and Stafford loans.\n\nNeed - Determined Need - Need isn't what a family says it needs; it's what FAFSA and/or CSS schools determine as your need.\n\nFA - Financial Aid - Many think that FA is free money.  It often is not free money.  Low income students get small amounts in fed grants.  Ivies and similar elites have huge endowments and meet 100% determined \"need\" with little or no loans.  Some lesser private schools (which there aren't many) may give a decent grant (say $15k or so), but that might not cover all of determined need.  Over 75% of FA packages contain student loans, so when a school says that they give FA to XX% of students, be aware that that aid may be mostly loans.\n\nMerit money, Merit $, Merit Scholarships, or Academic Scholarships - some schools (not ivies) give scholarships based on test scores and GPAs.  Some schools that give merit scholarships do not consider need, but some do (and will ask for a FAFSA).\n\nFull-Freight - an expression that implies that you are paying for the full cost of attendance.\n\nW/S or W-S - Work-Study - Some FA packages will include about $3k in Work-study.  However, there's no guarantee that there will be a campus job to work the Work-study\n\nGap - Many FA packages contain gaps, since most schools can't meet need.\n\nCSS - CSS PROFILE - this is what many private schools use (in addition to FAFSA) to determine what a family should contribute.  It considers more sources of income such as NCPs).\n\nNCP - Non Custodial Parent - FAFSA doesn't consider the income/assets of a NCP, but CSS does.  CSS also looks at the income/assets of step-parents.  CSS also considers assets that FAFSA doesn't.\n\nOOS - Out of State - State publics charge OOS students a higher rate of tuition - sometimes called non-resident tuition or OOS tuition.\n\nED = early decision. Applicant gets application into the school by an early deadline and will hear result from the school by mid-December. Applicant agrees to matriculate at school if accepted (except for instances where the financial aid offered by the school isn't enough to make attendance possible). Decision to matriculate expected by the beginning of January.\n\nRD = regular decision. Applicant meets a later deadline and will hear result in March/April. No need to make a decision until May 1.\n\nBy submitting RD applications, an applicant will have heard from all schools and have the different financial packages to compare one with another. Financial packages have been know to differ quite substantially in their loan vs. grant content and in the actual aid awarded--some parents have had $20K per year differences in packages.

Please no TL;DR.\n\nfreshmen year: Not good, not bad. I got a 3.1ish each semester UW GPA.\nSophomore year: I came into the year looking for a fresh starts. I was in full IB, and thought it'd be a good year. I got a D in pre-IB chem.Then 2nd semester I was able to get a B+ in the class. And my grades were much more satisfactory, though still not what most of my friends are (3.25 UW, IDK weighted). Sadly to do even that in the chem class, I had to sacrifice some stuff in other classes.\n\n*current Junior first semester*: So I probably have a D in math.....I know it comes off as not being mature, but I tried so hard in that class. But my teacher was not helpful in giving me the tools I needed to succeed, didn't help with HW at math-help sessions, didn't go over tests with me, took forever to get back any assignments, etc. I basically began to use the internet as my only learning resource. My other classes are all the highest level at the school. I think I'll end up with a 3.15-3.25?\n\nSo here is what I am planning to do, crazy as it is. I want to be able to excel at math, or at least make up for the crap I've shown thus far. I'm dropping math at my school, mind you it was just Core 3 (normal class, not pre calc or whatnot).\n\nI tested into precalc at my local community college. It is an online course. I will be taking that during the spring semester there, then continue onto pre calc II in the summer. THEN during my senior year, I plan on doing IB calc, the 2nd hardest math available at my school. You might be asking, why would someone not good at math want to do an insanely hard math class. Well, the answer is both teachers are ones who deliver results, and are strong math teachers.\n\nSo, mostly every other class has been satisfactory. I do have 2 Ds on my report card (or...at least one, if the other one goes up or down is beyond me), a C+, 7 B-s (including two from my junior, these are a bit below par, but one is in IB bio).\n\nSo here is what a basic app of mine should look like\n\nHispanic\nfirst generation\nClass rank: ???\nFinal GPA: ???\nIB Diploma\n\nLibrary tutor (ironic, isn't it?): three years, god knows how many hours, lots of results from my students. I really like this\n\nStarted poetry program at library: two years (I get people interested in reading and writing poetry, with a bunch of different lesson plans).\n\nWrite poetry in free time (as well as short stories and essays): I've actually won a few scholarships.\n\nKendo: I'm first Dan, hope to be a 2nd my senior year.\n\n*Summer stuff: Business program, the stuff above, summer courses at community college (this year)*\n\nSo, assuming I AM able to perform well enough in my pre-calc classes, overall have a good 2nd semester of my junior year (We'll say 3.80+), do well on the standardizes tests, and my summer courses/pre calc classes bring up my GPA.\n\nDavidson, Carleton, St. Olaf, Santa Clara, Colorado College, Chapman, Pitzer, Brandeis, American University, GWU, UW Seattle\nI am fairly aware of the competitivness of these schools.\n\nAlso\nWashington and Lee, Whitman, Colgate, Reed, Colby, Grinnell, Pomona, CMC (the last two are giant reaches, even among all of these I know.....).

I was originally into Civil Engineering for the money, but the more and more seminars I go to about it, the more I realize this is kind of the perfect job. It encompasses all 3 of the above - we certainly do have to come up with our own ideas, we generally will pursue multiple types of work for complexity, and we DEFINITELY (over time) see the results of our work, whether physically or electronically.\n\nI feel bad for all the accountants and whatnot who just work at numbers on a screen, or workers who have some repetitive task assigned to them with no choice.\n\nIn fact the entire article is true. They say games like WOW give us \"immediate satisfaction\" that the brain craves so badly - it's all manufactured psychologically. For me, it happened with Brain Age - if you've ever played the game, it's just quick logic or quick math problems - but you are immediately rewarded with a giant green check mark and pleasurable animation. Just thought, maybe elementary kids would like math more if they had this type of system :)\n\nThis is what most of us don't get in everyday life--quick, tangible rewards. It's less about instant gratification and more about a freaking sense of accomplishment. How much harder would we work at the office if we got this, and could measure our progress toward it? And if the light shot from our crotch?

I just had a major home(stay)sickness. Trying to be productive, I wrote this essay down as a practice essay. Please give feedbacks! =D\n\nHere goes:\n\nIt was almost midnight; the long hand of the clock was going to touch 0.00 in 15 minutes. 20th April 2010. 2 days after my arrival.\n\nWhile my sister was snoring soundly and happily next to me, I was trying my best to close my eyes and sink into deep sleep. Mission failed. Attempting to sleep, I wriggled to the right, to the left, all of which brought no result.\n\nGiving up, I just stared at the ceilings.\n\nStaring at the ceiling, I came up with brighttheory. Perhaps, I hopelessly thought, it was just a dream \u0096 a blissful dream, yet only a dream nevertheless. In the morning, you would wake up, and the dream would be gone. Lost, but subconsciously remained, hidden under thousands of other memories.\n\nBut I knew it was not a dream; I had bloody photos as the evidences. That experience was definitely real, as real as, say, my sister next to me, or my unsolved math homework.\nSo, instead of pondering another philosophical answer, I lied on my bed, registering a random list of the things I missed from that trip.\n\nI missed the painful 3-mile walk from my homestay to Macleod train station which I had to endure every now and then. It was an awfully long walk that I had to regularly bear, before discovering another short, less than a mile walk to the 548 bus stop.\n\nI missed the stars. Back home, I only get to see 3 or 4 stars, at most 6, during clear, cloudless night. There, the stars are countless. When I gazed at the sky, limitless stars would gaze back at me \u0096 which was why I enjoyed the painful 3-mile walk. On the other hand, maybe I should focus more on the street, not on the stars.\n\nI missed riding the Connex train. The train went \u0091ch-ch-ch\u0092, people getting in and out. Mothers with their noisy children, punk rocks with their awfully deafening iPod, skaters with their skateboards, aged people carrying supermarket bags, students chatting with each other about \u0093Party!\u0094 and \u0093Ooh\u0085I think he/she is looking at me\u0094. I used to sit anywhere near the window, stretching my legs, watching people passing by.\n\nI missed my homestay mother\u0092s cooking. I missed helping her preparing the food \u0096 or to be exact, helping her cleaning the remaining mess. She was always there, busily chopping raw ingredients in the kitchen by the time I arrived home. During that sacred moment, she would run about with messy hair, frantically preparing everything before 6. \u0093I never like eating\u0094, she once said, one hand adding vinegar to the mixed ingredients, the other hand tossing the broccoli inside, \u0093I just like people eating my food.\u0094 \u0093You are so skinny, dear\u0094, she critically said, throwing heaps and heaps of rice into my bowl to my horror, \u0093Here. Have another helping.\u0094\n\nI missed the annoying trance music and racing games which was eternally played in my homestay brother\u0092s room. The music was so loud that I could feel it rattling the wall, while I was trying in getting a goodnight sleep. The games were so thunderous until I actually thought several gang members were having a drift race on the street. To worsen it, he played until 2 or 3 o\u0092clock in the morning. As a result, I had 3 weeks of regular \u0091thump-thump-thump\u0094 from the neighboring room.\n\nI missed being adventurous, being able to jump into a bus or tram which led me into unknown places without consideration. It made me feel like a backpacker, a genuine traveler.\n\nI missed getting lost in a bus until 1 o\u0092clock in the morning. That kind of trip, when the bus drove to completely unfamiliar stops and I desperately asked the bus driver (and myself), \u0093Where the **** am I heading to?!\u0094 and tried to find hints from the signs and small shops.\n\nI missed chatting with my housemate while borrowing her laptop. She usually nagged about me not bringing my own laptop (\u0093Why don\u0092t you bring your own laptop??!\u0094), and laughed afterwards.\n\nI missed sitting at Federation Square, where there were performances every single day. My favorite was that crazy Canadian lady who asked several male audiences to slap her \u0091Canadian\u0092 butt. She always started and ended her lines with \u0093This is a politically correct\u0085\u0094, \u0093Canadians are peaceful, loving citizens\u0085\u0094, and \u0093I\u0092m terribly sorry. Really, I\u0092m sorry. Canadians never want to offend anyone.\u0094\n\nI missed my in-depth discussion about McDonalization with my English teachers. \u0093Big Macs in Shanghai, Miami, and Melbourne. They all taste the same.\u0094, \u0093But the meanings behind the people going to McDonald\u0092s are different in each countries.\u0094, and the \u0093According to ***uyama/Hanlon/Akande\u0085\u0094\n\nI missed tracing the hip, small lanes in the city, trying to find \u0091The Caf\u00e9\u0092 and \u0091The Cappuccino\u0092, both finally found after drinking tons of coffee. Okay, I missed 'The Cappuccino'.\n\nI missed my homestay parents\u0092 hilarious comments and attitudes, and my housemate\u0092s baffled expressions while looking at them exchanging opinions. I, on the other hand, switched off the TV and watched them instead, while eating my ice-cream.\n\nAnd, on the top of my list:\n\nI missed the freedom I got during that 3-week trip. It felt like I could go anywhere, be anyone. I could take my shower at 11 pm, sit at the train station whenever I wanted, jumped in and out of trains/trams/busses using my own guts. It was the most amazing feeling. I could literally do anything. I was finally free!\n\n\u0085..\n\nHalfway through the list, I unconsciously slept. The dream was a flashback of all those memories. The departure. The laughter. The confusion. The arrival.\n\nThe next day, the dream had disappeared. It had gone.

I know schools hate students with a bad trend and I honestly dont have any excuse (divorce moving ect) for my grades other than the fact my classes were really hard and I did not put in as much effort as I needed to have. Any opinions regarded the extent to which they will scare colleges away?

Perhaps this has been suggested before, but I haven't seen it.\n\nThe yield is an indicator of student selection amongst accepted students.  When divided by the admissions rate, it normalizes for how selective the school is in choosing their students.  The result is fascinating. For example, Harvard is 79% yield / 8% acceptance rate = 9.88.  Princeton is 59/10 = 5.9, etc.\n\nIn looking through this, it is not surprising in many places, but there are a few very interesting \"shifts\" from standard rankings.\n\nCaveats:\n\n1. This is NOT a comprehensive list.  I have listed 55 schools that I selected to test this out, mostly amongst the most selective with a few less selective schools scattered in to see how this works lower down the USNWR scale.  Perhaps someone with access to a database of all the yields/admission rates could make a more complete list.\n\n2. I used the College P*Rowler percentages, which have no decimal digits.  A more accurate result could be obtained from the actual numbers of accepted/attending students from the Common Data Sets.\n\n3.

I have lived with my grandmother for over two years now and she is retired, supporting us on Social Security alone. The problem is, I had to use to my mother and step-father's income for the FAFSA so my EFC is 5233, clearly not representative of my actual situation. This is only made worse by me making some bad personal choices when I was still living with my mother and not performing nearly as well as I could have in school. As a result I have an EFC my grandmother and I can't afford and I don't qualify for any merit aid. I'm not pointing any fingers and I deeply regret putting myself in this situation. However, self-pity isn't going to get me anywhere and the only way I am going to get out of this is with the hard work I should have been putting in over the past 3 1/2 years of HS.\n\nAs a result of my grades, I'm not able to get into any of the institutions I want to study at as a freshman student. I do however have a 1900 on the SAT so if I pull my GPA up at one of the schools I did get accepted to or a community I think I have a good shot of getting into some upper-mid range schools as a sophomore or junior transfer student.\n\nThe important questions for me though are financial aid. I could get accepted into every Ivy school out there but if I can't pay for them it isn't much use. What are the financial aid opportunities out there for transfer students and are things like merit aid based on a college GPA and SAT scores something that a transfer student would be considered for or are they reserved mostly for freshman?\n\nTo make the situation more understandable here is my specific situation. I live in Pittsburgh but am not eligable for the Pittsburgh Promise ($5k scholarship for Pgh residents going to qualifying PA schools) due to my GPA. This leaves me one of two options. I can go to California University of Pennsylvania where I was accepted into the honors program but also have roughly a $6.7k gap in my financial aid package Stafford loans included. My other option is the Pittsburgh Promise will pay for me to attend the local community for a year and given that I maintain a 2.5 GPA throughout the first year I will qualify for the last three years of the Promise, $15k total. I fear that the lack of acedemic challenge at community as well as an unconventional \"college experience\" that is far more like 13th grade of high school will lead to me making the same poor choices I made in high school due to a real lack of interest in doing \"busy work\". None of this focusing made any easier by my ADHD.\n\nGiven my financial situation affording CalU this year seems feasible but would involve using my entire $2.2k in savings and either convincing one of my biological parents to take on a PLUS loan or at least get my mother to apply and be rejected in order to get the additional $4k in Stafford loans. The problem with this is how I would pay for my next three years of school, though this is a pressing issue for any institution I would attend.\n\nSo my main question is although going the community college route and getting the Promise money may seem the best route, is it really? I still am unsure how I will afford 3 more years of college even with the added $5k a year. Would I be better suited going to CalU and whlie spending a decent amount of money, be attending a better institution where I will be attendind honors courses as well as having oppotunities to build my resume with extra curriculars? I have my sights set on UPitt as I feel it's where I can get the best ed:cost ratio. The cost of attendence is roughly $25k a year there, very reasonable for the education and much more affordable than any of the privates or LACs that I like. But which of these two options is going to put me in the best position to transfer to UPitt (or elsewhere) for Physics and will either help me in terms of qualifying for merit-based aid based on my college performance and SAT scores?\n\nSorry if I rambled throughout that post, my head is just all over the place with worry right now. I greatly apprecaite any help that anyone can offer me on this. Thank you in advance!!

I am sure that this has been discussed ad nauseam\u0097the pros/cons, IUPUI???, your guidance counselor!, the  21 percent response rate, etc. etc. etc.\n\nWhen I first took a look at it, I noticed some peculiarities in schools that the guidance counselors seemed to \u0093like\u0094 compared to the \u0093actual\u0094 USNWR rankings.  Upon closer inspection, my suspicions were confirmed and I compiled a list of the 25 schools that  the guidance counselors \u0093over-ranked.\u0094*\n\nFrankly, I was surprised how easily many of these schools could fit into \u0093categories\u0094.  Out of the top 25, I was able to create the following categories:\n1)\tFlagship Public Schools\n2)\tRegional schools\n3)\tSchools with a \u0093specialty\u0094\n4)\tBrown and Cornell (lesser Ivies)**\nAnd then of course IUPUI, which while I am sure is a fine school, but seems like an outlier within these rankings.\n\nAs one would assume, many flagship public schools ranked higher in the eyes of guidance counselors.  The reasoning is that counselors would presumably be more familiar with schools in their region.  That accounts for Minnesota, Texas A&M, Texas, Berkeley, UNC, and Michigan.  I did find it curious that Wisconsin and Penn State did not enjoy a boost from counselors within their region.  Of course, this could be one adverse effect of only having 21% of counselors respond to the survey.\n\nThe next group of schools that I have labeled as \u0093regional schools\u0094 also came as no surprise.  Being from the northeast, schools like Fordham, BC, BU, and Northeastern are very popular and all great schools.  The former two are Catholic schools and in predominately Catholic areas (like where I am from), this adds to their prestige.***  Pepperdine, while not in the northeast, is another school similar to the aforementioned.  Again, this makes perfect sense, because guidance counselors are going to be sending quite a few students to these schools and would thus be more familiar with them.  This idea of \u0093familiarity\u0094 is a theme I will expound upon as the rest of the schools are examined.\n\nColorado School of the Mines, Virginia Tech, Purdue, Georgia Tech, Carnegie Mellon, American, George Washington, Georgetown, Tufts, Syracuse, and Johns Hopkins.  All of these schools have something in common: they are all well known for something (or a few things).  The first four schools all have top-notch engineering programs, CMU has engineering and theatre, American and GW have great IR programs, Georgetown has the School of Foreign Service, Tufts has Fletcher, Syracuse has Newhouse, and Johns Hopkins has SAIS.  Guidance counselors, heck the public at large, will be more familiar with these fancy programs that are among the best at what they do in the country.\n\nHowever, this is where the biggest problem arises concerning the Guidance Counselor\u0092s picks\u0097they are not judging the institution as a whole, their judgment is clouted with the prestige of a fancy program.  Sure, there is some value in that, for an individual interested in Nuclear Engineering, you can\u0092t get much better than GT.  Or for the aspiring Pulitzer Prize winner, Newhouse is a great fit.  These counselors were not asked to rate a specific college within the university, but the institution as a whole.\n\nNonetheless, this survey and its results help illustrate that folks are going to regard things they are more familiar with more highly.  Perhaps there is some merit in these rankings; perhaps they are an absolute abomination.  They do reinforce to me the need to evaluate schools for yourself.  As I pointed  out earlier, you need to figure out what is important to you.  For some, the Colorado School of Mines is the best school on the planet.  However, for people who can barely program an alarm clock, it might not have much to offer.\n\n*This is not in a derogatory sense but in the literal sense.\n**I do not know what to do with Brown and Cornell.  I find it interesting that they are considered the \u0093lesser Ivies.\u0094  I am assuming that their status as Ivy League schools leads to some inflation by the guidance counselors who are impressed by the prospect of sending a student to the Ivy League.  Nonetheless, this could just be the result of a 21% completion rate of the survey.\n***I would also put Villanova into this category and I would be interested in seeing where Villanova would rank according to the opinions of Guidance Counselors.  By the same token, I would put Tulane in this category too.  I suspect that Hurricane Katrina prevented Tulane from more praise from the guidance counselors.

Although I told myself I would study for months, Senioritis kicked in a bit early this year and I find myself in a rather daunting situation. What is the most effective way to prepare for the SAT within a 36-hour period?\n\nI received a 2040 on the March SAT. Many incredibly stupid and careless mistakes were made, and I hope to do better this time around. Here is my expected projection for Saturday's SAT as of now (w/o studying):\n\n-Math: 700-720; The Math sections continues to infuriate me, as whenever I look back over the test to see what I missed, I find I should have scored a near-perfect score (Typically, there is one multiple-choice or grid-in that I either didn't know how to do or did wrong with an incorrect method). The other 2-4 MC problems I missed were because I am retarded and am unable to follow simple directions. I'll do the entire problem correctly, but then not read the last couple of words detailing what the answer should be. For example, if the problem is to be solved by calculating the value of 2x, I will solve for x and then hastily put it as the answer, neglecting to realize that the original question sought the value of 2x. I have taken 2 practice math sections this morning, and received the same results: stupid careless errors as a result of reading too fast. Unfortunately, the math section - although the easiest IMO - takes me the longest of all sections and I generally only have a minute or two to look back over my answers. TL;DR - Should be missing 0-1 problems on math section, but misread many easy questions and solve for the wrong variable/mistype numbers on calculator/etc.\n\n-Critical Reading: 640-690; For some god awful reason, I cannot score well on CR. It is impossible. Even after reading over my answers, the correct answers, and the reasons behind the correct answers from the March SAT, I still do not understand how I can do better. I simply do not agree with the answers CB deems \"correct\". I feel as if the \"correct\" answers are more of a matter of opinion than anything else (although, obviously this isn't the case as many people consistently do well on CR). Maybe my mindset is wrong or something, idk. If the question is asking what the author is saying, I will say what I feel is the most textually supported or implied, yet I still get it wrong and do not agree with the \"correct\" answer or the reasoning behind it. There is generally only 1 question that I can look back on and find I made a mistake, even after given the correct answer. I also struggle with the sentence completion questions, as my SAT vocab isn't all that great. However, unlike the reading comprehension part, I can obviously look back at my mistakes and say \"oh, acumen doesn't mean ____, that's where I went wrong\".  TL;DR - don't agree with the correct answers given on the reading comprehension q's I miss, SAT vocab isn't all that great either.\n\n-Writing: 680-740; The Writing section is a little bit interesting to me, as I am very good at somethings and very bad at others. The questions about which underlined word makes the sentence incorrect are the most difficult questions on the SAT for me, as I have a hard time looking at a sentence and picking out which word is used wrong. Although I tend to do better on these questions than I think, I find them to be the ones I am most unsure about. In fact, I think luck has a lot more to do with my correct answers on these types of problems than anything else. There must be some online guide, CC post, etc that can teach me the SAT rules of grammar in an hour or so. On the other hand, I find the essay to be the easiest section of the SAT hands-down (followed closely by math). I scored a 12 on my March SAT essay by supporting my claims with completely fabricated historical events, literary figures, etc. I also scored a 12 on my essay the first time I took the SAT over a year ago, so I'm pretty confident I'll score between a 10 and 12 this time around.\nTL;DR - Not so great at MC, but do very well on the essay.\n\n\nDoes anyone have any advice on the best way to improve my SAT scores based off of the descriptions above within a day and a half? My biggest problems are vocab (should I memorize one of those SAT word lists), writing multiple choice (the sentence usually looks completely correct to me), and careless mistakes on math. I feel as if my math scores have the biggest room for improvement in such a short period of time, as the problem is not that I don't understand the actual math itself but rather that I read problems incorrectly in my haste to finish - unfortunately, with little time to spare to double check my answers anyways.\n\nAlso, I realize I am an idiot for waiting up until 2 days before the test to start studying, and that 1.5 days is not nearly enough time to fully understand all of the concepts within the SAT.\n\nThanks for any advice                "}, {"date": "2010-12-16T15:30:07+00:00", "url": "http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/what-my-chances/1051610-chance-me-for-stanford-mit-caltech-columbia-cmu-etc.html", "messages": "\nStats:\n\n"}, {"date": "2010-12-29T04:38:38+00:00", "url": "http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/college-admissions/1060106-commonapp-feedback.html", "messages": "\n                    Hey y'all, my commonapp essays are basically done so I'm just looking for some more feedback, any suggestions are appreciated and I'd be thankful!\n\nPlease briefly elaborate on one of your extracurricular activities or work experiences in the space below (150 words or fewer, 1000 character maximum).\n\nPolitics and global issues have long been an interest of mine and considering our deteriorating environment I felt compelled to do something, anything. As a founding member, chairman and later secretary of my school's environmental club, EPK, I created that possibility to pitch in and have worked towards sustainable development in several ways. I have been affiliated with organizing our schools annual energy-saving week, resulting in many decreasing consumption by roughly 8000 KWh during that week. Further, I have coordinated bake sales as fundraisers that raised many hundreds of dollars to plant trees in sub-Saharan Africa through the organization WWF. As our small entourage believes that achieving sustainability begins with changing attitudes we are also raising awareness by for instance informing students at school.\n\n\nEvaluate a significant experience, achievement, risk you have taken, or ethical dilemma you have faced and its impact on you.\n\n[title missing]\n\nMy mother\u2019s cooking, and great food in general, has definitely been an Achilles\u2019 heel of mine for the greater part of my life. I still often joyously imagine the Schnitzels and Pfannkuchen she makes. The delicious smell created when the delicacies sizzled in oil always created a fantastic sensation, leaving me waiting eager with anticipation. However, my indulgent, unconstrained relationship to food has been replaced by one characterized by balance and control. Yet, more interesting is that both my body and mind have both undergone corresponding changes.\n\nI was long troubled by the fifty or so extra pounds I carried with me before I actually decided to improve my situation and make it my goal to lose them. Luckily, this decision coincided with me finally being old enough to exercise at my local gym; I had long admired weightlifters and the sheer amount of mass they were able to pull off the ground. It was a perfect match, the immense determination I went in with was only amplified by the initial results I enjoyed.\n\nOf course, I experienced setbacks, they forced me to adapt, and in an industrious manner I continued my struggle. My methodology was clear; determination and knowledge were to be pivotal to me in reaching my goal; these are what I relied on whenever I faced difficulties. Thankfully, I also had much support. This mainly came from close friends, parents and perhaps most important, my personal trainer and friend who taught me immense amounts. He furthered my interest, inspired me to sit up late nights, encouraging me to critically use sources to learn about nutrition and exercise. He opened my eyes to the vastness of disinformation available which had often clouded my view. The hours studying were sometimes spent resisting the urge to indulge, but most often I persisted, focused, eager to learn more and grateful when recalling everything I learnt and every ounce of progress I made.\n\nAfterwards, I still remember feeling as if a monumental weight had been pulled of my chest, not only literally. The experience and all the things I had learnt transformed me as a person; as I, a year after committing myself, had lost almost fifty pounds I was suddenly free. My mind had become clearer. I realized the power of ambition and how it can shape you; it taught me not to give in, to be persistent, and to find solutions, working around problems by methodically attaining information. Not to forget, I found a sport that with all probability will remain a lifelong passion and interest.\n\nI think the first one is better than the second, I feel that it is somehow missing \"catchynes\" or perhaps the final paragraph doesn't make enough of a point. Anyhow, thanks in advance for any feedback!

Here's what I have so far:\n\n\nWhat area of research should not be funded and why? </1500 Characters>\n\nWhy do we fund research to begin with? A cardinal impulsive force must exist that compels us to do so. Most logically it is our desire to find the truth and produce new knowledge. Any area of research that produces knowledge already obtained or which leads to incomplete or false knowledge is worthless and should not be funded. In all of my experiences this area has been studies chiefly based on statistics. While statistics can prove useful on many occasions it is often misused, misleading and meaningless. There are several methods in which accidentally or for the gain of the perpetrator false information can be produced by implementing statistics. For example, a tooth paste company funds a statistical study to convince buyers that their tooth paste whitens teeth. Coincidentally, 9 out of  the 10 people who were surveyed report that indeed the paste did so. This statistic would leave people believing that the paste actually works, when the researchers could have simply selected 10 people with already white teeth. Other such studies conclude that one variable causes the change in another just because a correlation exist between the two. These false statistics, believed by many can be quite detrimental in the quest for the truth and new knowledge. Instead of funding statistical studies such as these the money should be spent on controlled experiments that produce results that are both precise and accurate. Only then could the results be established as the truth and new knowledge.\n\nAny sort of help is appreciated.

I put a lot of research into my schools and applied to a lot of them, from safeties to high reaches and some in between.\n\n\nI lined myself up for some merit money at schools, in case I did not get into my reaches or could not afford them. Glad I did\u0085\n\nI only applied to one in-state public, because quite frankly, I live in a rust belt state and I am definitely looking to leave for college. I really liked the in-state school. Other than the location it was seemed like a really good fit for me.\n\nBut, like I said, I was looking forward to leaving the state and when I had my dad run the financial aid calculators online, we got pretty good results, most results were in range of what he said my parents could pay. Worst one said our EFC would be $2k higher than the number he gave me, but that wouldn\u0092t have been a big deal, I could have made it work.\n\n\n\nSo, I thought if I got into one of my expensive reach schools that I was really started to like, it was probably going to be relatively affordable for us. I knew I\u0092d probably have to graduate with some loans, but it hopefully wouldn\u0092t be exorbitant.\n\n\n\nThen my dad filled out the FAFSA a few days ago\u0085\nThe number it spit out was literally over 2X the number my dad said he would pay. It was the pension that pushed it over. When he was filling out the FA calculators, I knew he was getting a pension, and thought his income might have been a little higher. But it is a government pension and he is still working for the government, so I just figured the full affects might not kick in until he retires for good or stops working for the government.\n\nI know FAFSA is different from the Profile and each school is different, but I know the EFC\u0092s are going to be in the same ball park at each school.\n\n\n\nSo this puts our AGI on a whole new level\u0085and I\u0092m basically screwed for those fancy schools.\nOnly 100% need school I applied to that has a big enough endowment to give me enough aid is Penn. And my chances of getting into Penn are\u0085not very good haha.\n\n\nHere are my stats:\n3.8/4.22 GPA\n2110 SAT, 790 USH SAT2\nEagle Scout (and Senior Patrol Leader), Student Govt, a lot of volunteering, MDA Camp Counselor, grant writing for a local non-profit, staff writer for school paper, Eucharistic Minister, worked at least one or two jobs throughout high school, JV intermural sports, and a few other ones.\n\nSo, I am proud of my accomplishments, but I\u0092m not exactly a slam dunk candidate.\n\n\n\nBut not completely screwed.\n\nI applied for Navy ROTC a few months ago, a little late in the ROTC process, but my recruiter says I still have a pretty good chance of getting the scholarship. I applied for it because I am genuinely interested in serving in the military (I grew up in a military family) and thought about joining the Navy or Coast Guard after college.\n\nNow, I waited so long because I originally wanted to do ROTC, but later backed off because I thought it might interfere too much with the typical college life and OCS is only a few months, so I didn\u0092t think it would be that bad. Plus I didn\u0092t want to be committed to one branch, who knows a lot can change in four years.\n\nBut, I decided to apply for the scholarship because, it\u0092s non-binding and I was changing my mind so much about college plans, I figured another option wouldn\u0092t hurt.\n\n\nBut, I am assuming that I am not going to get the scholarship because I applied so late and I am a tier 3 major applicant (Business. Navy wants science and engineering majors, but still has some room for other majors. Not a ton of spots though).\n\nSo, we will have to wait and see.\n\n\n\n\nSo my college list just shrunk from 12+ to about 4 schools, for now. Only two are affordable right now. Ohio State is my instate option and Alabama gave me a scholarship that would make it slightly cheaper than OSU (OSU gave me a small scholarship). Still waiting on South Carolina, they release scholarship decisions in March. Tulane gave me a nice merit scholarship, but COA is still going to be about $13K more than what my dad says we could pay. But apparently they are not done giving out money either, so hopefully I can get some more from them.\n\n\nI think it will come down to OSU vs. South Carolina. I got into both Honors Colleges (apparently S. Carolina\u0092s is a lot harder to get into and is smaller, so that was cool) and was admitted into South Carolina\u0092s International Business program (honors pre-admit).\nAnd honestly, I am leaning more towards South Carolina at this point. Parents are not cool with that though.\n\n\n\nAt the start of my college search process, my parents said I could go wherever I wanted to go and it would be completely my decision. Later, earlier this year, they gave me a price range, and I thought it was fair, I was grateful that they were helping me at all for college.\nSo my college list stretches from Boston to LA and almost everywhere in between. I did my homework on which schools have good financial aid and which ones are generous with merit money.\n\n\nBut, now my parents are really putting the pressure on for Ohio State. They want me to stay close to home and they know it will be affordable. They even afforded to buy me a car if I go to OSU.\nI like OSU, I just don\u0092t want to live in Ohio after graduation and that is where OSU\u0092s network is strongest.\n\n\nI am looking to major in Finance and International Business. Ohio State business school has a better reputation overall and is better for Finance, which is my first choice for majors. But I am still very interested in International Business and South Carolina\u0092s International Business program is ranked #1 in the country\u0085over the likes of Wharton, Georgetown, NYU, etc\u0085\n\n\nThis is confusing and I am having trouble finding info about each business school, especially USC Moore. I want to know what the average USC Intl Business major does after graduation, or in other words, what the placement is like. I have heard anecdotes of recent grads landing very nice jobs in Atlanta, Charlotte, the West Coast and even London. The people telling me this seemed very genuine and candid, but they were somehow connected with USC and were probably biased a little. I believe them; I would just like to hear what they are saying from a third party.\n\n\nMy parents do not want me to go into debt for undergrad, and should save money for grad school, which for the most part I agree with. But\u0085I want to major in business and it seems that finance is a major that depends heavily on school/business school prestige. Like for example, going to either OSU or South Carolina will not land me a job on Wall Street, while going to a school like UVa might if you network and play your cards right.\n\n\nBut, this is why I am interested in USC\u0092s top ranked Intl. Bus. program. Sure, it may not land me an Investment banking job in New York(which I\u0092m not even sure if I want a lifestyle like that haha), but it still might land me a nice job. Which is apparently very important for MBA admissions, which is where I\u0092d like to end up.\n\n\n\n\nSo, I am confused and this week has been an emotional roller coaster. And this is why you have safeties that you really like haha. I would probably be fine at OSU or South Carolina, I was just hoping to have a few other options.\n\n\n\nI am not mad at my parents for only agreeing to pay __X__ amount of dollars, I hope I didn\u0092t come off that way. I have a sister that is entering high school and they will have to pay for her college in a couple of years, so I can\u0092t be selfish.\n\nHowever, I am having a little bit of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu from a few years ago when I picking out a high school, except it was kind of reversed. I went to public grade school and expected to go to the local public high school. My parents began to push me to look at one of the local Catholic high schools, so I did and come March/April of 8th grade year, I was legitimately on the fence between the two schools. The Catholic school had a pretty good reputation, but it was pretty expensive. The local public just went through a big scandal/controversy while I was in 8th grade, but we live in a nice suburb and its academics were solid.\n\nSo, I told them I was leaning towards staying in public school. Well, that didn\u0092t go over well. My mom was the one getting mad, telling me don\u0092t worry about the money since I mentioned that was a reason for picking the public high school and she was getting mad at me and convinced me to try going to Catholic school. Of course after that, she told everyone it was \u0093all my decision\u0094 and that I love it.\nwell, far from it and as a senior, I realize that it was a big waste of $40k+ over four years, and IMO public school would have been a better fit. Catholic schools can\u0092t afford to pay their teachers as much as public schools (at least mine) and the quality of education was very hit or miss. I did have some great teachers, but I had/have some downright terrible teachers that turned me off from learning all together. Plus the local public school offers about double the number of APs my Catholic high school does, which would have been oh so nice to take an AP class that I was actually interested in. But, the average 8th grader isn't thinking about APs when picking out a high school, haha.\n\n\nNow, I have made friends at high school and kept in touch with old grade school kids, so its not like I\u0092m a loser that hates high school and has no friends, but like I mentioned before, $40k+ is a hell of a lot of money to spend on high school, especially when my local district had a good/decent high school that may have been a better fit. But, by the time I made this revelation, it was kind of too late to transfer, might as well finish it off. Wish I noticed or was more assertive freshman year, but that\u0092s life.\n\n\nI know I shouldn\u0092t be, but I am still bitter about how \u0093I\u0094 chose my high school and it is reminding of how the college selection process is starting to pan out.\nLast time, my gut told me to go to public school, but my parents disagreed and I heeded to them. My gut is telling me to go to South Carolina, and I plan on listening to myself this time.\n\nMy parents are already getting tense about uptight about this, and I just hope it doesn\u0092t get ugly.\n\n\nSorry, I know this post was soooooo long and all over the place, and honestly I have no idea of what I am asking you haha. I guess I am just looking for \u0093parently\u0094 advice, because all my parents tell me is \u0093just go to OSU\u0094 and so on.\n\n\n\n\nThanks, (especially if you made it this far!)

In this instance, streamlining will translate into fewer cadets trekking across the Terrazzo in future years.\n\nThat's because the Air Force is implementing a strategy for force management. In layman's terms, the military now has more people serving than it will be authorized to have. So top brass is looking for ways to thin the ranks, and the Air Force Academy is included in those efforts.\n\nUnder the Air Force's plan, the size of the cadet wing will be reduced from roughly 4,500 to 4,000 cadets by Oct. 1, 2012. Enrollment for each incoming freshman class will be shrunk gradually.\n\nNext year's freshman class will consist of 1,120 students. That number will dwindle to 1,050 for the class of 2016, but the following year the number will climb to approximately 1,165 cadets, where it will remain. Normal attrition is also being factored into the drawdown of the cadet wing's strength.\n\nIn comparison, this year's freshman class has about 1,285 cadets.\n\nCommenting on the impacts on the cadet wing, Superintendent Lt. Gen. Mike Gould said: \"It's tough on our admissions people; it's going to be tough on athletics. It's going to have an impact on diversity.\"\n\nThe planned cutbacks come on the heels of directives from Defense Secretary Robert Gates and members of Congress to trim the military budget and lower the number of people serving in the armed forces.\n\n\"Without additional measures, we could grow to 7,000 over our authorized end strength by the end of fiscal year 2012,\" Gen. Norton Schwartz, the Air Force's chief of staff, said last week. \"Based on these projections and our need to operate within our means, the secretary of the Air Force and I made the decision to intensify force management actions to meet our congressionally mandated ceiling by the end of fiscal year 2012.\"\n\nThe expected aftermath of those force management actions cuts across a wide swath of the Air Force Academy's cadet-wing operations.\n\nAcademics and Cadet Life\n\nThe impact will be felt from the admissions process onward. With fewer spots available for incoming cadet classes, an already competitive process will become even more so. Col. Carolyn Benyshek, the director of admissions, said her office will not change the way it evaluates applications or the criteria used in admissions decisions.\n\n\"We're going to keep our same standards, which are pretty high,\" Colonel Benyshek said. \"I don't foresee that changing.\" The force management effort \"simply means fewer qualified young men and women will get an opportunity to attend.\"\n\nShe also said the change will require the Academy to make appointment offers later than it has in previous years.\n\nIn addition, there will be implications for applicants who are admitted and complete Basic Cadet Training. Smaller class sizes will create more opportunities for interaction between cadets and instructors. Cramped conditions in dormitories will be eased because cadets will no longer be assigned three to a room.\n\nFaculty levels, hiring and research should remain unaffected by the force management actions, said Lt. Col. Robert Kraus, of the Dean of Faculty's Office. He said that's because current levels are based on a calculation of 4,000 cadets.\n\nFinally, because actual enrollment will be brought in line with budget projections, the Academy will be able to spend more per capita on the education of each cadet.\n\nDiversity and Permanent Party\n\nConcerted efforts to make the Academy more diverse will continue as before, although those efforts may not show up in the statistics.\n\nGatekeepers are determined to do their part to prevent a lack of diversity in future incoming classes.\n\nDr. Adis Vila, the Academy's new chief diversity officer, said the Academy's Recruiting Directorate is spreading the word about the Academy and searching for young people who might be cadet material. A group within the directorate focuses on attracting candidates of diverse backgrounds.\n\n\"Our aspirations are to make USAFA more inclusive,\" Dr. Vila said. \"And that means those at the Academy, including cadets and permanent party -- whether civilians, retired military or contractors -- the Colorado Springs community, and all who share in this Academy. After all, the United States Air Force Academy is the Air Force's Academy and every taxpayer's Academy.\"\n\nCol. John Linn, director of resources and personnel, said the force management actions \"will create challenges for our permanent party,\" but he added that the \"silver lining\" is it will be easier to support a smaller cadet wing.\n\nFor permanent-party personnel who are apprehensive about their job security as a result of force management, he offered some reassurance.\n\n\"Caring about each other is the core precept of our wingman culture, and we are obviously concerned about the effects various force management programs may have on our team,\" Colonel Linn said. \"We have a team of selfless leaders and supervisors poised to prepare our personnel for involuntary measures and, if necessary, support the very small percentage that may be affected by force management considerations.\"\n\nAthletics\n\nDr. Hans Mueh, the Air Force Academy's athletic director, said the impact of reduced class sizes on Falcon sports wouldn't be readily apparent.\n\nHe said it will take a few recruiting years under the new structure to determine what effects the athletic program will incur as a result. But he offered his best guess on a few points of concern.\n\nFirst of all, he noted a direct link between enrollment and the ability to recruit athletes.\n\"At the D-1 level, recruiting is everything,\" Dr. Mueh said. \"There is almost 100 percent correlation between recruiting and competitiveness.\n\n\"On the other hand, the Air Force Academy has certainly shown through the years that there is a great intangible called heart, which is tough to assess. We bring in athletes we believe will be the best Air Force officers we can produce and leave it up to the coaches and players themselves to develop them to a competitive level. I would submit that we've been pretty successful in that effort.\"\n\nHe also provided a breakdown of the numbers, which, unlike heart, are tangible.\n\n\"In any incoming class of cadets, we have approximately 23 percent recruited athletes,\" Dr. Mueh said. \"If you do the math for the expected incoming class of 2015, at 1,120 cadets, that gives us about 260 recruited athletes. We had been expecting to recruit about 300 cadets.\n\n\"We have allowed the five revenue sports -- football, men's and women's basketball, hockey, and volleyball -- to continue to fill the numbers they had been recruiting and will spread the reduction of 40 recruited athletes among the other 22 sports.\"\n\nDr. Mueh also said that spreading the smaller numbers across the athletic program is likely to minimize the impact of the enrollment reduction.\n\nHe added that the coaches have been \"totally supportive of this directive from the Air Force\" and that \"the effect on competitiveness will be minimized.\"                "}, {"date": "2011-02-22T10:15:35+00:00", "url": "http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/prep-school-admissions/1091813-can-you-create-your-own-best-composite-ssat-score.html", "messages": "\n                    Is it possible to take the SSAT more than once & send in only the best parts of each test result (ie, Verbal score from try #1, Math score from try #2, and Reading score from try #3)?  Or is it all or nothing - if you want to have a school see the results from any test, all 3 sections (verbal, math, reading) are automatically sent?\n\nI got to wondering about this after reading a 2008 thread on SSAT scores entitled \"Does it affect your chances to..\" which included the following comments:\n\n<<Some schools actually make their own composite score based on the highest scores for each section (verbal, reading, math). I was told, \"the computer does it for us.\" >>\n\nfollowed by\n\n<<You can take the SSAT test as many times as you like and just send the score that you want.

No maybe the Big 10 actually recruits more delinquents.\n\nWhen you add in that Arkansas is responsible for more than half of the criminal records of those 4 schools and is the only one to not have won a BCS championship since 2006, that makes the results even more astonishing. If you think maybe the South doesn't keep strong criminal records, Florida has the most open public records of any state in the country.\n\nI'm from Chicago. I've lived in the South the past 3 years. A lot of the stereotypes Northerners have of the South are true. The idea that the SEC is somehow less moral than the Big 10 is garbage. It stems from nothing more than jealousy.\n\nTend to your own herd rather than accusing others of overgrazing.

Today, I read through many of the Ivy results threads (or at least the first few pages... I have some sort of life). Each and every one made me almost sick to my stomach. Before, I'd thought that amazing objective stats would pull me through--as long as I had some sold extra curricular activities. However, the results threads indicate that admission to an Ivy League school really is a grab bag!\n\nHere are my current stats:\n\n-I go to a pretty competitive high school in Northern Virginia that sends a couple people to Ivies every year. In fact, one of my sister's good friends got into Columbia, Cornell, and Dartmouth yesterday. My neighbor, another of my sister's friends, just got into Harvard and Princeton. Even so, I'm beginning to think they were accepted due to their unique qualities--one is a drama freak, the other is big into poli sci and debate (and speaks fluent French). I, however, want to pursue medicine (or something with the sciences). I feel that the path I've chosen is not unique enough.\n\n-I'm currently 1/333 students, with straight A pluses in my classes. Make no mistake, though, these classes aren't easy. In fact, Drama is one of the most difficult classes in my schedule (and I come from a family of thespians)! Additionally, I think I'm the only one in my Biology class with an A plus (filled with sophomores).\n\n-I'm competing in the Virginia State Science fair this Saturday. I'm actually quite proud of this accomplishment. In my school fair, I placed third in my category (behavioral sciences). Then, in the regional fair, I placed second (weird, huh)! Hopefully, I can use my presenting skills to win the judges over and secure a top 3 place in the state fair!\n\n-I'm a member of debate (placed okay at two tournaments in public forum, failed to make it to regionals). I'll be the public forum co-captain next year.\n\n-I'm in Mu Alpha Theta (small EC, yes, but still...)\n\n-I'm the Freshman Class President. I had to battle it out with four other contenders to secure this spot. I was declared the victor by a mere five votes! That was exciting...\n\n-I run cross country (and plan to for all four years). I don't think I have a viable chance at varsity, though.\n\n-I play tennis (and plan to for all four years). I'm currently number 8 (challenged up from 10--haven't lost one yet). I think the top 6 are given letters, so hopefully I can reach the top by April... However, I'm confident that I'll be a varsity player for my 10-12 years.\n\n-I will be taking the absolute hardest course load possible at the school (plus three extra levels of math and all AP sciences). Math and science are my thing.\n\n-I'm going to get a job as soon as possible. Probably at a nearby Bob Evans or McDonalds or something... I heard that having some work experience is beneficial when applying to college. I'm not old enough to get a job yet.\n\n-I plan to... Volunteer a lot at the local hospital + pharmacy, run for presidential office my remaining three years, and basically continue everything I've been doing thus far. I'm definitely going to start committing a lot of time to debate, so that I can make it to regionals next year (and hopefully states).\n\n\n\nSo, can you help me? It seems like my ECs are pretty strong, but seeing the fabulous stats of all the rejected Ivy applicants has really scared me. It's always been my dream to attend an Ivy--most specifically Harvard. Please give me advice so that I can do my best to achieve my dream. I understand that even seemingly perfect applicants are rejected every year. I just want to project myself in the best light and with the best possible chance of admission.\n\nPS: What do you think has been the determinant in all these 'random' decisions? Essays? Interviews?

Not at all stellar.  1 year Varsity football.  However, decent amount of church related community service.\n\nRecs: Great liberal arts teacher rec (English teacher), average Science teacher rec\nEssays: I proof read it and it was ok, but nothing that would blow adcoms away\n\nAnother thing, he took a lot of community college courses and he was ahead of his class, taking ap physics and ap calc as a junior, which most students take as seniors at my school.\n\nCatch: Single mother, <60k Salary\nResult: Accepted after being wait listed during EA\n\n2.  Caucasian male, goes to one of the best public high schools in Illinois\nGPA: 4.00\nACT: 35\nECs: Captain of SciOly team, State medalist 3 out of 4 years, he did Math Team, placed at state each year, also qualified for USAMO junior year, he is doing Physics Olympiad this year instead (i don't know how well he's doing but knowing him, probably quite well), 4 years varsity tennis, a lot of community service with his church.\n\nAlso, he plays the piano like a boss, has played at many local concerts.  Now, he's taken a lot of university level courses in math and physics, and he did research with a professor at UIC, but for the sake of brevity i won't go into everything.\n\nRecs and Essays: Overall, top notch, i proof read a few of his essays and he tells me his teacher recs were great.\n\nCatch: Overall annual salary >200k\nResult: Rejected\n\nNow, looking at these two cases, i honestly think your familial situation has a huge effect on how adcoms look at you.  Now this is probably fairly obvious, but many kids freak out about the fact that they can't afford to go to expensive summer programs and what not which will hurt their chances of getting in - no they won't!

Thanks!\n\nPrompt: Is honesty always the best policy?\n\nWhile honesty is a fundamental virtue and does provide benefits for society, it is not always the best policy. It is truly a situational trait and can be seen as a two-sided street; that is to say, sometimes it is important to be honest while at other times honestyw ould be a less favorable option. Because of this, honesty is not always the best policy as there are times when secrecy and deception are better suited.\n\nThis policy of not upholding honesty in our society can be seen in the United State's recent capture of Osama Bin Laden. While this operature(?) was joyous for some, it called for some doubt as to whether Bin Laden's capture had actually occurred. The U.S. military and intelligence has kept the logistics and evidence of this case very secretive in what they maintain as \"for the good of the country and the military\". Despite our countries' freedom of expression, even the military, which is regarded as one of our main institutions, has deemed the necessity to keep various things private. Their secrecy shows that honesty is not always the best policy, especially if this would jeopardize the military or defense of the country. Even if the execution of Bin Laden was hypothetical as some believe, keeping the truth from the public has resulted in heightened morale, a stimulated economy, and increased support for the war on terror. These benefits have all resulted from the decision against honesty.\n\nIn the novel Of Mice and Men, George has no option to end his friend's life, Lennie, who has abnormally low intelligence, had accidently killed his farm owner's mistress and was about to be put to death violently. George, who was sensitive of Lennie's disability, decided it was in Lennie's best interest to kill him painlessly, or else he would suffer at the hands of the other farmers. Although George was dishonest and promised Lennie of all the things they'd do and how he'd have a great life, George secretly ended Lennie's life as painlessly as he could. George, although dishonest, had the best intentions for Lennie and acted without honesty so that Lennie would have the best outcome. This shows that honesty is not always the best policy as it is not always in a person's best interest.\n\nI started writing at like 20:30 remaining and went on a frantic rush at the end to finish it off and had no conclusion or third example.\n\nAlso, at the start of paragraph 3, will that disaster of grammar be a huge deduction of points?

Just as I was leaving, the doctor, looking at my family history, asked me if I'd considered having a genetic test.  I said I hadn't been inclined since I thought there was no real benefit in knowing (and since I didn't think I'd have prophylactic surgery).  She said that those who test positive can now take MRIs in addition to mammograms and that there is an actual benefit in terms of vigilance.  By a strange coincidence, it turned out that the doctor I'd seen 18 years earlier for a surgical biopsy was coming in this afternoon and she said I could speak with him about it if I wished.  He is quite well known in his field and speaks nationally on the subject of genetic testing for BRCA. I decided to meet with him.\n\nHe strongly encouraged me to have the test and took the position that doctors can save lives when there is a positive test.  He was referring to surgery.  He gave me statistics, etc. and told me I could leave a sample and take a couple of days to make up my mind, or come back at a later time once I'd thought it over.  I decided to leave a sample, knowing that I have until Thursday to cancel the test. (My insurance covers this.)\n\nI'm ambivalent.  Over the past several hours, I've concluded that I would not have prophylactic surgery if I had a positive result, regardless of his position, which was obvious.  I've always known surgery was a possible way of reducing risk, long before there was genetic testing, and I didn't think it was right for me.  I know I would become aggressively vigilant if I had a positive result, seeing a doctor at least twice a year, getting MRIs, etc.  I always thought I would not want to know, but now that I realize I could be more vigilant, it makes a certain amount of sense.  But living with that kind of sword of Damocles could be tough.  But I feel like I already walked through the door today.  Now that my sample has been taken, if I decide to decline the test, I will be left wondering.\n\nIf anyone has advice, I'd like to hear it.  There is \"only\" a 12 percent chance of testing positive according to the doctor which seems pretty low, but it's still daunting.  I talked to a retired physician in my family who said, \"Don't do it\" and a practicing physician who said, \"Do it, but know why you are doing it and what you are willing and not willing to do if it's positive. Or don't do it and treat yourself to an MRI every year, regardless of whether insurance pays for it.\"                "}, {"date": "2011-06-22T17:32:21+00:00", "url": "http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/harvard-university/1166142-harvard-wants-sat-and-aps-even-for-transfers.html", "messages": "\n                    Not that I'm actually expecting to get into Harvard as a transfer applicant, this is more of a curiosity question, but I'm just trying to ask if I am reading this correctly.

Hardships can often lead us to examine who we are and to question what is important in life. In fact, people who have experienced seriously adverse events frequently report that they were positively changed by their negative experiences.\n\nAssignment: Do you think that ease does not challenge us and that we need adversity to help us discover who we are?\n\nAdversity and obstacles absolutely alter the way humans think, indicate what they value, and can ultimately have beneficial repercussions. Success is not necessarily a result of good fortune. Sometimes people face misfortune, but this can actually benefit humans by allowing them to discover who they really are.\n\nOne key example of how adversity leads to an overarching success is the story of the U.S. Constitution. Originally, the Founding Fathers drafted a document called the Articles of Confederation. However, this system had an extremely unstable executive branch, causing chaos in the country. People tended to riot and disobey the government. Therefore, America's early leaders abandoned the Articles and instead wrote the U.S. Constitution. The immediate backlash from the masses that the leaders faced cause them to question their values. In the end, they realized that an executive power was necessary. While the sudden change in ruling style may seem too abrupt and perhaps even intimidating, the obstacles that confronted the Founding Fathers led to the re-evaluation of America's values and the successful U.S. Constitution.\n\nOvercoming obstacles and gaining success are too central themes in literature. The success stories that are present in history and daily life have manifested themselves in great literary works. For example, The Odyssey by Homer is a mythological, bigger than life tale of a warrior who has to overcome many problems in order to return home from war. His journey tests his intelligence and strength and challenges him in ways that ease could not. In the end, Odysseus prevails as a hero. While he eventually achieves success, his journey shaped his character and allowed him to discover himself. He became more humble, more caring, and more wise. Therefore, it is evident that his daunting tests led to a better life.\n\nWhile unfortunate events and trails tend to discourage humans, perseverance and determination can lead to outstanding results. Not only is success gained, but humans can learn about themselves, such as how they confront failure or hardship and how they handle rewards. As seen in U.S. history and Western literature, these concepts are extremely prevalent, particularly in Western culture. They have themes that can be applied to everyday life and can teach humans how to become more resilient, intelligent, and wise.

We are driven by our conscience to act in a way that we believe in. It is the most influential voice that is the basis of our thought, telling us what is right and wrong.\n\nIn the novel Great Expectations by Charles Dickens, the convict Magwitch is driven by his conscience to making a bold statement that frees Pip of his nervousness. Although Pip had stolen food to feed Magwitch and is consequently concerned of being caught, Magwitch reveals that it had actually been him, relieving Pip of his crimes. Magwitch is driven by his conscience and his morals to do what was right: taking the blame for Pip's altruism. Although Magwitch knew he was to suffer additional charges, resulting in defaming and further loss of wealth, he chooses the path of morality instead of fame and fortune, which may have resulted by not taking the blame. Magwitch, seen as a convict with little regard for morals, shows that his conscience overcame his desire for personal benefit and instead gave him spiritual confidence.\n\nLike Magwitch, Gandhi also exhibited a great deal of conscience. Educated in Stouth Africa and the possessor of opportunities that could provide for him for life, Gandhi instead chose to become an advocater for the independence movement of India. Gandhi toiled for long years, fighting bravely against their oppressive colonizers. He desired freedom and equality above all for his fellow Indians, who were being taken advantage of. Gandhi, upon reaching adulthood, had the option of staying overseas, in Britain or South Africa, where he would be inevitably linked to fame, fortune, and personal comfort. However, he knew that his people needed him, and that he was capable of setting India free, a ability that was desperately needed at the time. In the end, Gandhi followed his conscience, which motivated him to free India, a task he accomplished. Gandhi chose not to fall for fame or wealth and instead, he became an inspiration worldwide for peaceful civil rights movements.\n\nIn my own community, I have witnessed the struggle between conscience and fortune. A doctor of whom many respect chose to attend to Nicaragua's needs instead of continuing his own occupation for a length of two years. Dr. Ranner chose to forgo his wealthy position in the United States to help those in Nicaragua in need of open-heart surgery. Dr. Ranner undertook this operation without the promises of fame or fortune, but instead through his own goodwill and decision.\n\nMagwitch from Great Expectations, Gandhi from India, and Dr. Ranner from my own community all show how conscience is a more powerful motivator than fame and fortune can be. Their benevolence and altruism were of higher value to them than their wealth.\n\n\nDo you think that this can get a 4/4?

I used marbles, jack balls,\nand Ping-Pong balls, all hanging on strings and painted\ndifferent colors, all inside a box representing our solar\nsystem. This crude assortment of materials allowed a\nreasonable representation of what was known 40 years\n35 ago about the nine planets: Mars was red and had two\nmoons; Jupiter dwarfed the other planets (I should have\nused a basketball but it wouldn\u0092t fit in the box); Saturn\nhad rings.

I still remember to this day the feeling of sitting in a cold room with only the sound of scribbling pencils and the ticking of the clock echoing off the walls.  There were 1,647,123 other students who taking the same test as I did (Goldman), but only a selected few would get accepted to the college of their choice.  So, where did this competitive test, feared by so many students, originated from?  It all started in 1900 when the College Entrance Examination Board was established to help colleges simply and accurately assess their applicants based on intelligence and not on financial advantages (\"The History of SAT\").  It seemed like a great reform at the moment, but as the test continued to be nationally distributed and relied on, further research and findings have leaked some of its deficiencies.  A big flaw that the Scholastic Assessment Test seems to have is that it favors and suppresses certain groups of people, which makes it bias in several ways: financially bias, sexist, and racist.\n\nOne of such groups of individuals is the poor, who finds great difficulty in keeping up with their wealthier counterparts.   According to Laura Sellers, a well-established writer of The Chronicles, \u201cSAT scores increase with every additional $10,000 earned by the test-takes\u2019 family\u201d (Sellers).  This statistical finding seemed too ironic, since the SAT's purpose was to break college entrances away from favoring students with rich backgrounds.  In America, education is given to all kids from kindergarten to 12th grade and taught by professionally approved teachers working in a state approved school.  By the time these students reach their senior year, they should all be equally skilled in algebra one, comprehensive reading, and writing essays, which are skills tested on the SAT.  With this in mind, the big scoring gap between the poor and the wealthy is making many educators question the reliability of the SAT.  College Board, an organization that oversees and distributes the SAT, and other organizations are creating a monopoly off the SAT by offering private preparation courses and practice materials.  Big companies such as Princeton Review and Kaplan charge more than $800 for these courses, promising to raise SAT scores by up to 200 points (Grabmeier).  For schools and families with money to spare on extra courses for their child, these students are taught test taking strategies and familiarity to the format of the test.  Some test taking strategies that the student learns are when to guess, how to skip hard problems, and how to read the questions before reading the passages.  Financially deficient students are now put at a disadvantage and the SAT then becomes not a measure of aptitude in college, but a measure of how well a student knows how the test works.  Several colleges use the SAT as a ranking system to admit students with the highest SAT score, believing in its accuracy to assess students on their aptitude for college.  However, Professor Claudia Buchmann and her other colleagues from Ohio State University conducted a study that showed that students who took private SAT preparation courses scored an average of 60 points higher than those who did not take the courses (Grabmeier).  In the end, the SAT just contradicted itself by favoring wealthy students who have learned their way through the test.\n\nIn addition to being financially bias, the SAT also proved itself to be sexist by favoring boys and their ability to take risks.  In 1995, the University of California in Berkeley observed that \u201cfemales with identical academic indexes as males earned higher grades in every subject including math and physical sciences\u201d, yet these girls continue to scored considerably lower than boys on the SAT (Perry \u201cThe SAT Math Test: It\u2019s Rigged\u2026\u201d).  Another statistical data then presented that even though girls outnumber boys in GPA ranking, the ratio of perfect scores between boys and girls is 2.22 to 1(\u201cPerry \"More on the Gender Gap\u2026\u201d).  These observations complement the Educational Testing Service\u2019s findings that \u201cgirls\u2019 SAT scores improved dramatically when the time limit was removed while boys\u2019 scores remained about the same\u201d.  From these figures we can conclude that the test is definitely evaluating something other than real knowledge that is learned in school.  Many educators have even suggested adding 140 points to women\u2019s index because the SAT degrades their intellectual ability (Perry \u201cThe SAT Math Test: It\u2019s Rigged\u2026\u201d) and some theorize that these differences are the result of an evolutionary disparity between girls and boys.  By nature, boys are riskier than girls because of their tendency to overestimate their abilities and their addiction to adrenaline rushes.  Girls on the other hand have a different flux of hormones and amygdala structure than boys, thus contributing to their sensitivity to emotions; considerably fear (Mcbride 2).  Since test taking skills include knowing when to guess, it becomes evident that boys are the better test takers, furthermore, it shows that the multiple choice format of the SAT is favorable to boys and fails to accurately assess intelligence between genders.\n\nLikewise, the SAT also fails to assess intelligence between different ethnicities, favoring Caucasians and suppressing African-Americans and Hispanics.  Since 1988, researchers have collected SAT averages between different ethnicities and found that Whites\u2019 SAT averages had been hovering above Blacks\u2019 averages by nearly 200 points from 1988 to 2005 (\"The Widening Racial Scoring Gap...\u201d).  Moreover, in 2010, Hispanic students\u2019 average score for both the critical reading and math section were behind the national average by about 60 to 50 points (\"What Are the Average Scores\u2026\u201d).  It could be the cultural differences that make specific questions become advantageous to the White community and difficult for minorities.  To eliminate any lurking variables that might have an influence on SAT scores, a controlled experiment was conducted, testing Hispanic and White students with identical educational background and GPA.  The results showed that White students still achieved a higher average compared to Hispanic students (Nieli).  With all lurking variables eliminated and the score differences between ethnicities still present, the SAT is definitely putting some sort of disadvantage on minorities just like Hispanics.\n\nThese bias are a serious problem, considering that the Scholastic Assessment Test is a single test that is trusted by thousands of colleges and taken by millions of students.  It is not only distributed in America, but internationally, to foreign students hoping to find higher education in America.  Nevertheless, the SAT is failing to serve its initial purpose by being financially bias, sexist, and racist.  By looking at statistical data, controlled experimentations, and the background of the SAT, we have come to learn that this \u201cfair\u201d test is actually full of flaws and biases that favor wealthy White men.  There are several reasons to this issue but some of the more obvious ones are the expensive SAT preparation courses, the evolutionary differences between men and women, and the cultural differences between Whites and minorities.  These problems cannot persist and the best solution seems to be eliminating the SAT itself, which was created solely on the reason that not all schools are at an equal quality of education.  The nation therefore needed some sort of system for ranking the student\u2019s aptitude for college success.  But is math and English the only thing needed for college success?  No, there are more influential qualities such as ambition, persistence, critical thinking, social abilities, optimism, creativity, and many others that all contribute to helping a person do well in college.  With the SAT gone, these qualities will be given a greater chance to stand out in essays and teacher recommendations.  Even success in high school that are shown through GPA and extracurricular activities, fostered from four years of hard word, shows much more about a student\u2019s potential then a four hour test ever could.  Along with this, eliminating the SAT would also mean that the money spent on distributing them can finally be used to assist the specific schools that are struggling to better educate their students.  With all of these benefits\u2014 reducing bias, promoting more critical qualities, and providing resources for schools in need\u2014this solution will bring a new and better change to the word \u201ccollege entrance examination\u201d.\n\nReferences:\n\nGoldman, Jeff. \"Number of Students Taking SAT Increases, Average Score Drops | Schools.com.\" Schools.com.

Frankly speaking, even some of the strong-minded individuals would not hesitate to attribute some of their success to the advices and opinions of others since being successful alone is often implausible. Examples from history, current events and my personal anecdote explicitly demonstrated that accepting the opinions of others will often lead to success.\n\nOne important reason people are more likely to success when they accept the opinions of others is that opinions of others may act as good war strategies. This idea is clearly supported by the example of great Chinese general, Liu Bei, during the era of the Three Kingdoms. Liu Bei had been a great general throughout that era. He had successfully led his army and won several great wars such as the Battle of Chi Bi in which he defeated the force of the oppose faction led by Cao Cao, and of course, Liu Bei did not win this war entirely on his own but with the assistances of his war advisors such as Zhuge Liang. Zhuge Liang was an extremely clever mastermind of Liu Bei. During the Battle of Chi Bi, Liu Bei had faced a dilemma in which there was a lack of arrow supplies. However, in light of Zhuge Liang\u0092s plan, the Liu Bei force had successfully stolen the enemy\u0092s arrow supply and this played an important part of the victory of this battle.\n\nFurthermore, the renowned video game company, Electronic Art, also demonstrated the importance of the opinions of others. As most people, especially the hardcore gamers, know, Electronic Art has always maintained good gaming qualities, but do you know how? Unequivocally speaking, it is criticisms that maintain the qualities. Criticism allows EA to understand the strengths and shortcomings of it\u0092s products. By knowing it\u0092s shortcomings, EA can then be able to identify what aspect of it\u0092s games should be improved. For example, when the Battlefield series games first released in 2002, many critics were given by the gamers. Therefore, EA took most of the critics as advises and improved it\u0092s next upcoming Battlefield series games. As a result, EA\u0092s games became more and more popular. All thanks to the constructive criticisms given. Without critics on it\u0092s games, EA may not be successful until now.\n\nMoreover, this idea can also be proved by my personal anecdote on learning English vocabulary. Ever since I started learning English vocabulary, I have been using my own strategy which was to stare at the words and read in mind instead of my parent\u0092s strategy which was to read them out loud while writing them down. Slowly as time passes, I realized that my strategy did not bring my English scores up. Therefore, after a long term decision, I then decided to accept my parent\u0092s opinions and strategy. A strategy of parents that I ignored has now proved to be successful and useful by my drastic improvements in English exam results. Fortunately I did take my parents opinion in account or else my English may still remain at the same level as before.\n\nThrough the analyses of above examples, one should, indeed, realize the importance of accepting others opinions as well as to understand how opinions of others can be used as improvements or enhancements to many things such as war strategies, product selling, and learning styles of people. In fact, one should always take in accounts of other\u0092s opinions regardless they are good or bad since these opinions may be great assistants for one\u0092s success.

Next season is basketball, and they have their team already set.\nSpring season, I'll be trying for;\nTrack&Field\nTennis\nField Hockey\nSoccer\n\nI want to have more volunteer hours/opportunities, but I don't know where to go to find them.\n\n\nTwo of my current courses were ones I had no choice in taking, all others courses were full. We have ~2500 kids in this small school, and we have many exchange students taking up classes even though they stay 2~5months, and (only few) 10months. I don't have many excelling traits about me (I made a huge mistake in my school life, long story), which lowers my chances abundantly.\n\nI most likely put TOO much information, but my dream is to attend boarding school, where I can achieve highest success for life. I know with these grades, I don't have a chance at all though.\nPlease give blunt opinions of this mess, and possible solutions?\n\nThank you all for reading and replying.

In my freshman year, my main goals had been to maintain high grades, to participate in the sports I enjoyed and to have fun doing whatever I decided to do.  However, it wasn't until last year (my sophomore year) that I gave serious thought about getting into the college I want to go to.  I didn't understand much about what I needed to do to get into a good college and after learning more about what it took, it didn't seem TOO hard.  However, now, with so little time remaining, I feel a bit disappointed at my chances.  While my ventures are many, I feel as if the quality of everything I do is not at the level of which would impress.  The thing is, I've enjoyed almost everything I've learned and haven't been particularly good at one thing.  I've set goals for myself in what I want to do (whether it will impress colleges or not), but none of them have really been accomplished yet.\n\nIn the area of the arts\nI've played the Piano and Violin since elementary school\nI am currently in first violin, but am easily considered \"amateur\" to someone who is actually good\nMy goal in playing instruments was to become good enough to record good renditions of pieces I love to play and post them on Youtube to share with the world\nHowever, it is very hard for me to play a decent piece perfectly and so I have only made one recording.\n\nIn the area of Academics\n- I am smart, but I'm more of a \"worst of the best\" type of guy. I may be smarter than many, but when compared to the truly elite at my school, I do not seem to compare.  I often have to work very hard in order to keep up with these \"local geniuses\".  I do love to learn however, and enjoy facing any challenges that I may face.\n- I took the NCHO last year because it was a test grade for our AP Chemistry course and because I am very competitive, so I studied hard (did every practice test) but didn't even make semis (missed it by 4 or 5 points)\nI plan to take the Bio and Chemistry Olympiad this year and plan to study mostly Bio as it seems to favor people who are willing to grind hours reading the textbook.\nI also wish to participate in a Siemens or Intel science research competition, but I only wish to research in a topic that I am genuinely interested in and I have little idea of how to find such a mentor available who would share my interests. (also, I am worried that I have started too late; is there still time?)\n\nIn the area of Athletics\nI have never been an exceptional athlete and thus was never really passionate about any sport in which I participated because I would be discouraged when I didn't perform well\n- I started playing baseball in the 3rd grade and played for 5 years or so. I was only outstanding in the outfield which was usually where the position the lesser players would play.  I did well in practice, but never seemed to perform well in games and I didn't have many good friends who played baseball so I decided not to continue playing in high school.\n- In high school I joined the waterpolo team because I heard waterpolo was a cool sport and because my friend was joining too.  Because I didn't have much talent, I didn't really commit myself to practicing.  I was a great defender on the JV team, but because I wasn't fast enough and panicked on offense, I didn't have much playtime.\n- I used to hate tennis as I only played it because my sister played it as well.  However I eventually started enjoying it more and more and in my freshman year, joined the school team.  After a year of practicing hard, as I got better, my friends wanted to play me less and less as I was the worst of them and so they didn't enjoy the idea of \"losing to me\".  I became discouraged and didn't play as much.  I now continue to play after I was re-inspired by videos of great tennis pros.\n- After seeing someone who graduated from my school in my freshman year participate in a triathlon, I've gained interest in doing so myself as it seems exciting.  I would participate... if I find the time to prepare.\n\n\nSumming it up:\nMany people advise others asking for advice to just \"follow your passions and do what you enjoy doing\".  However, I enjoy doing everything I do, and can't seem to decide what I enjoy doing more.  As a result I can't really decide what to commit my time to therefore don't have any specific things I am \"passionate\" about.  The result is that I am mediocre at everything I do, but this does not really impress.  I wouldn't be surprised if I am rejected by all the elite colleges I wish to go to; I'd merely be disappointed.  However, I still really want to get into the college that I want to go to and I am looking for any advice on what I can do to impress.

Two years ago he went through a \u201ccollaborative\u201d process to work out a child support arrangement.  The process was also supposed to work out custody/visitation, but it resulted in the mother being granted full custody and no arrangement was ever made for visitation.  My brother-in-law has periodically told me that he was going to go back to mediation to work on the custody issues, but he always had an excuse as to why he was putting it off \u2013 he wanted to wait to get the financial arrangements resolved, he was going to wait until after the wedding, etc.  It\u2019s now been about 2 years since he has seen the kids.  His parents see the kids periodically, and we have had the kids stay with us on occasion, so they have a relationship with their father\u2019s family, just not with their father.   He lives about 45 minutes away, so this is not a distance issue.\n\nI got an email from the new wife before Christmas \u2013 BIL is working on becoming part of the kids\u2019 lives again, but meanwhile he would like to deliver gifts to them.  Will I be seeing them?  I could truthfully say that we had no particular plans to see them but that if he brought presents over I would deliver them.  He brought the gifts by a few days ago and asked me to tell the kids that the gifts were from their father, but not to tell the mother where the gifts had come from, as she would throw them away (probably true).  So I\u2019m supposed to tell a 7 year old not to tell his mother something?  Oh, please!  Besides, I had already let the mother know that there would be gifts (I hadn\u2019t been told that this was a secret) and she had asked me not to bring them over, as it would be confusing for the kids and painful for her.   The 4 year old has no memory of his/her father, but the older one does, and s/he feels (I think) a sense of abandonment that would in fact make a gift confusing.\n\nSo now I\u2019m smack in the middle, and I really don\u2019t know what to do.  I wouldn\u2019t think of giving the kids these gifts behind their mother\u2019s back.  My BIL bought each kid a nice toy, but nothing that they really need.   I would just honor the mother\u2019s wishes and not deliver them, but I\u2019m concerned that if mediation actually goes forward the first question to the kids will be, \u201cDid you get the presents from your father?\u201d\n\nI have considered keeping the gifts here and letting the kids play with them when they visit, but I wouldn\u2019t do that without talking to the mom first.  What do you all think?  If I do that, what should I tell the 7 year old?

This is my first thread, and i am here to ask you what do you think of my scores/gpa/situation to get into a good college in the US.\n\nOk, so lets start with my background.\n\nI am originary from the southeast part of Mexico (the one that is green and damp), and I am a senior year student. I come from a family somewhere between upper middle class and wealthy (so to speak). We can afford a college in the US, so money is not a problem. My main issue in this situation is that, in my city, we dont usually prepare for college, and my family certainly didnt prepare us (me and my brothers) for the big challenge that college is. So my big brother didnt make so much out of his life because of this, and my little brother is in his way to the same than my older brother (something that I am trying to change).\n\nSo, by the time I realized the importance of getting excellent grades (the old ones were good, not excellent) and the importance of extracurriculars and examinations (SAT, TOEFL), it was too late for my to pave the way properly to my college admission.\n\nSo as you may have guessed by now, I want to go to the US for college. No one in my family has ever done any intelectual achievement nevertheless (the money came from somewhere else), for this reason and more I am really motivated to make something out of my life.\n\nHaving said all of this, I would like you to tell my what to you think of my situation. The GPA in my school is measured in a different way than in the US, while in the US it is measured from 0 - 4 (Dont know if you can get a 0 or 1.0 though), in my school it is measured with a 0 - 10 (But no one ever gets less than 5). My school doesnt provide a translation from these grades to the GPA system, so my closest calculation is that my GPA is around 3.6 (My grade from 0-10 is 8.6, this is the average from the past 4 years).\n\nI went to Ireland for three months (In summer) so I could prepare to take a standarized test of English (IELTS, TOEFL, etc), something that I did eventually. I got a 96 in my TOEFL (should have prepared more for the actual test though), but I am okay with the results.\n\nBut, the previous things were not my biggest problems. My biggest problem had and has a name: SAT. When I found out about this test (around 4 months ago) when I was in Ireland, enjoying the Irish life and preparing for my TOEFL, so there was not too much that I could do about it.\n\nWhen I came back to Mexico, I took the test, and I prepared as much as I could, because of all the school work I had and thing that I had to do. I prepared myself enough to get a decent grade. I ended up with a 1640/2400 overall, with a 580 in Critical Reading, 550 in Math, and 510 in writing (havent practiced too much English writing in my life). So that score was at my first try, with a decent preparation (which consisted of practicing through one section of the test almost everyday for around 3/4 weeks). I am planning to retake it, as this score is from the December test, just one month ago, but now it is too late to take another SAT, as admissions are closing altogether around January and February and the SAT is in February with the results being delivered around the the end of the same month.\n\nHaving said all of the previous, I would like you to tell me my chances to get into a good college. I have already applied for Biochemistry in the University of Illinosi at Urbana-Champaign, and I am trying in Penn State (U Park) and the Perdue University as my main choices (maybe ill apply to some others as well).\n\nMy extracurriculars are OK, I was at my school basketball team (and made it into the state final), and I have done community service (clening streets, donating clothes and toys, raising funds), nothing impressive though.\n\nSo guys, I need your help. What are my chances of getting into any of these colleges? Do you recommend me some other college(s)? Any suggestions? What do you think I should/could do? Ask me if you would like to know something more about me (it is for you to evaluate my changes, that is)\n\nThanks to everyone!

I would REALLY appreciate it if you guys could help!! Thanks!!\n\nI think I wrote an essay based on a past SAT prompt. The following is the prompt and then essay.\n\nWe do not take the time to determine right from wrong. Reflecting on the difference between right and wrong is hard work. It is so much easier to follow the crowd, going along with what is popular rather than risking the disapproval of others by voicing an objection of any time.\n\n-Is it always best to determine one's own views of right and wrong, or can we benefit from following the crowd?\n\nWe can always benefit from following the crowd. It is not always best for one to determine one\u2019s own views of right and wrong, as straying away from the crowd can lead to negative consequences. Throughout history, literature, and in life evidence to support that following the crowd is the best path is pervasive.\n\nConsider the case of Socrates, who meets his death through his rebellious attitudes. Socrates fought against the democratic ideals of his day in ancient Athens and he went around questioning people with what we call today the \u201cSocratic method.\u201d Socrates had many followers, but he was still of the minority. Some of his students rebelled against the democratic government and even overthrew it twice, temporarily instituting a reign of terror in which property was deprived from people and in which thousands of Athenians were executed or exiled. Democracy was restored each time and the people of Athens eventually had enough of Socrates and his ideas, so they decided to put him on trial. As a result, Socrates was condemned to death and ordered to drink a glass of hemlock. Therefore, Socrates\u2019 actions prove that straying away from the views of the crowd may not always lead to the best outcomes.\n\nIn George Orwell\u2019s novel, 1984, Winston Smith\u2019s demise is a result of his rebellious thoughts and straying from the crowd. Winston sees the lies that rule his world and seeks to join the Brotherhood, a rebellious faction against the government. Little does he know though, the Brotherhood does not exist, and is actually a made up group by the tyrannical government that is used to trap people like him. He gets caught and tortured and at the end of the book, it can be inferred that he will eventually be executed. Hence, Winston Smith\u2019s straying from the crowd and determining his own views of right and wrong lead to his demise and prove that we can always benefit by sticking with the crowd.\n\nAs demonstrated by an event in my own life, it can be a good idea to follow the crowd. When it came time for lunch when I was visiting a college, I had not paid attention to where the restaurants and fast food joints were located. I decided to therefore follow the crowd. I had no idea where I was heading but eventually by literally following the crowd, I reached my destination. If I had not followed the crowd and found my destination, I probably would not have had time to eat while searching for the restaurants and therefore would have been starving for the rest of the afternoon. Thus, one can always benefit from following the crowd.\n\nA careful analysis of the examples above clearly shows that following the crowd is indeed the best policy. Straying away from the path the crowd takes can lead to dire consequences, while following the crowd can always prevent these negative outcomes.

Laziness. Excuses. Denial. Crisis. Repetition. These are symptoms of an epidemic that has been infecting students all over the nation. This disease is considered one of the most common to afflict high school students. This disease is procrastination (P. Rocrastinatii, or PR). For decades, scientists and scholars have scoured the school systems in search of a solution. However, due to the volatile nature of said disease, no universal cure has been found.\n\nWhile M High School students are known for their tradition of academic excellence, some of them are still vulnerable to PR. I was one of the unfortunate students to contract PR early during my freshman year, and the results were brutal. My life ran through a vicious cycle of symptoms going all the way from false security to crisis, and I was powerless to stop it.\n\nI finally began to discover how much I was falling behind my classmates during my junior year. Many of them, who had once been my academic equals, were now rising to the top of the class while my progress was stagnant. I became disappointed in myself for being too weak and undisciplined to keep up with my peers.\n\nI came to understand that I was the reason behind my disease, and that I was the only one who could cure it. I realized that I wanted more than the meager results manifesting from this self-inflicted syndrome. Self reflection was my antidote.\n\nAs I saw my classmates soldier relentlessly through challenging assignments, I finally became motivated enough to pick myself up before it was too late and prove to myself that I was capable of standing up to the competition. At last I didn\u0092t have to suffer from the panic of having to complete a project in one night. At last I had a goal to strive for \u0096 to show myself that I could flourish in even the most competitive surroundings. Through my efforts, I ended the second semester of my junior year triumphantly by making all As and scoring fives on all my AP exams without giving up any of my outside interests.\n\nNow, I am glad that I have overcome my infection before it was too late. YouTube, Facebook, and Gmail are no longer on my \u0093favorites\u0094 list on my internet browser, and I\u0092m actually writing this essay several weeks before its deadline instead of several hours. However, I couldn\u0092t have done it without the overwhelming diligence of M High School\u0092s student body. The high-achieving tradition of MHS was the real driving force that helped me develop a strong aspiration for doing my very best to face any challenge and strive in any environment. More importantly, it taught me enjoy learning and use competition as a tool for improving myself. I will embrace this mentality in college and beyond. But for the time being, my physician suggests that I spend the next 4 years in the University of California, where the educational opportunity is rich enough to help me recover from the damages caused by PR and resist its most durable strains.\n\n--\n\nAnd yeah, the purpose of this was to address my horribad GPA in a (if I may say so) creative way, and how I was finally motivated to begin working hard last year.

SORRY!\n\nthanks (:\n\nIs the opinion of the majority- in government or in any circumstances- a poor guide?\n\nThe opinion of the majority is not always the best guide. In the Grapes of Wrath, most farmers migrated to the west in hope of a new future. But the family only ended up with hunger and aggravation. The same goes for science. Should you always follow the crowd or be different and go your own way? Galileo Galilei rebelled against the church's belief and was thrown in house imprisonment.\n\nThe goal for science is prove what is said to be correct. During the 1600s, there was a scientist named Galileo Galilei. His idea of the universe was a heliocentric diagram - sun in the middle with planets circling around it. His proof was Mars. It was circling around on it's orbit facing the sun. However, it completely contradicted with the church's idea. Going with the opinions of the majority (at that time) would not only be a poor guide, but also a dangerous guide. Instead of checking whether Galilei's belief was correct, he was thrown into house imprisonment for life.\n\nIn John Steinbeck's novel The Grapes of Wrath, it takes place during the Great Depression. As we all know, during the 1930s there were dust storms, drought, and poverty. The Joads family, like so many others, decided the best way to earn money and be prosperous was by going west: California. They decided that when they found a pamphlet stating there were thousands of jobs offered in a variety of fruits, nuts, etc. But they were not rewarded. Instead they were cheated, bullied, and tortured till the end. First, instead of being paid a livable wage, they were haggled to a price of about 5 cents per crate. Next, they were teased with nicknames such as \"Oakies\" or \"Reds\". And lastly, they were harassed. In one scene of the book, when a tired, constantly-cheated-on farmer decided to tell everyone about his experiences with \"wages\", the police not only beat him up, but also shot a innocent bystander. This was definitely not the experience any farmers during the 1930s hoped for, but the majority realized that after.\n\nGoing against majority can lead to a better result. If the farmers all didn't go to California, maybe the results would be better. In a few years, congress passed a law for mandatory farming techniques and equipments. If Galileo Galilei didn't stand up to what he believed in, maybe we would still be gullible and believe the geocentric theory. Indeed there are circumstances where going with the majority would be correct, like not jumping off a cliff, but demonstrated through literature and history, the opinion of the majority may not always be the best guide.

(The short of it is my teacher has decided to take a sabbatical next year, somewhat unexpectedly. I'm not too keen on his interim replacement.) That would be my main, \"official\" reason for leaving, and totally acceptable to most parties.\n\nThat aside, I feel like I've made adequate progress in my playing, my studio mates are great, and I like a lot of things about the school. However, one thing is dragging me down a bit: the ensemble load, and the resultantly strict freelance policy.\n\nBackground: I took several years off of school, before deciding to return for an MM, during which time I freelanced fairly heavily, and also worked a non-music job. (I double-majored in undergrad, and fortunately have other skill sets to pay the bills-- which has helped the freelance lifestyle tremendously!) My impetus for going back to school was simply to be in a focused environment, surrounded with good instruction and good peers-- such that I could make swifter improvements in my playing, without the constant distractions of everything else. Even though being back in school was a bit of a transition after being a functional adult for a while, I was happy with my decision. I made some good progress, at least!\n\nHowever, I soon found that grad students here get pretty spread thin with school ensemble requirements, often to the detriment of practice time. (Ensemble directors here tend to over-program pieces with extended instrumentations, so you're soon pulling double or triple duty at the last minute, without any real say in the matter.) The applied faculty get miffed by the students going through spells of not practicing as much, but they just accept it as part of the culture... and nothing really changes.\n\nShortly after enrolling in school, I started getting calls for some better gigs (ICSOM- and ROPA-level), and constantly hit walls trying to get approved leave to take them. Sometimes it worked out, sometimes it didn't. Regardless, it was pretty annoying. I also tried to limit leave requests to anything which would have significant professional impact for me, and as a result, turned down a fair number of smaller gigs of lesser consequence.\n\nIn summary, I'm interested in finishing my MM studies, but perhaps somewhere which isn't so crazy with ensemble requirements and more lax about students taking off for prominent gigs, etc. (I'll leave my instrument out of it for now, but will say I play a wind, brass or percussion instrument.) Are there any schools, generally, which fit this bill? Regionally, I'm looking anywhere on the East Coast or the Midwest.\n\n(I also haven't ruled out just dropping school entirely, and instead just freelancing, taking lessons with good teachers, and taking auditions. I'm actually leaning that way, at the moment, but thought I'd investigate some academic options, as well, in case there's a suitable program out there.)\n\nAny suggestions are welcome!

Throughout history, there have been destruction of empires and wars which have all begun with small events. With that said, it is evident that catastrophes are sparked by a chain reaction as is depicted in the American Revolution, climate change and the fall of the Roman Empire.\n\nTo begin with, the American Revolution did not simply begin with a shot of a bullet, but a series of events that allowed the citizens to realize that they've  had enough. In the beginning, the citizens were given their freedoms, but as the British power expanded across the Eastern seaboard, the British tightened their hold. With many strict laws, such as the quartering act where citizens had to provide food and board to British soldiers, and taxes. The most famous tax imposed, the tea tax, led to the Boston Tea Party, where a group of men dressed as Indians boarded British ships and dumped their tea supplies in anger. As many troubling events continued, a catastrophe broke out, the American Revolution. Without a doubt, this chain of events, although insignificant alone, led to one of the most important wars for America.\n\nIn addition, the ever growing threat of climate change was not because of a single puff of carbon dioxide, but years of buildup and events along our history that lead to this overbearing threat on the whole human race. Ever since the discovery of coal, natural gas and other fossil fuels, the emissions have built of exponentially as well as its byproducts, such as waste and habitat destruction. Because climate change is defined as permanent changes in the norm of our climate, it did not truly affect the Earth until the recent centuries when industrial revolutions began around the world with many technological advancements but at the cost of almost depleting our resources. Looking at statistics, the climate today is being affected by emissions released in the middle 20th century, and with that said, it is evident that the many cause of climate change has built up to what it is today.\n\nLastly is the fall of the Roman Empire, initially a powerful and influential empire: expansion, political and military causes brought it down. With its power, the empire felt infallible and began to expand its territory. However, due to a weak military from political and economic problems, they were unable to take more land and in return began to lose their land from invaders. As this continued corruption ran through their government and weakened their infrastructure, thus leading to its fall and take over by the Goths, because of all these minor events, the great and mighty Roman Empire was reduced to a pile of rubble.\n\nIn conclusion, these catastrophes were not from the result of an alien attack, or a meteorite crashing down, but a series of negligible events that began to more than expected. One can never underestimate the significance of an event because its results can be unexpected and catastrophic.

Most modern era leaders need advisers to define their goals. Historically speaking, the success of the birth of the new country America could not be accomplished on their own. Another example would be the series of Harry Potter. The three students' success was achieved with a lot of help along the way. Several examples in literature and history show how success can, probably, be only achieved if there are advisers, helpers, and supporters along the way.\n\nAs demonstrated throughout Year 1 to Year 7 of the series of Harry Potter, the main protagonist could not accomplish the goals given to him without the extra help from his peers. In the fourth book, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, Harry Potter was chosen to represent the school in the Triwizard Tournament, a periodic event where all the neighboring magical schools come and battle the obstacles given to them. The first event was to defeat a dragon. The second was to accomplish many underwater feats to retrieve a fried. The third task was to go through a maze, while defeating monsters in his or her way. He defeated it, all of it. But the road that brought him to his success would be a friend, Hermonie, a servant, Dobby the Elf, and a classmate, Cedric Diegory. This shows how success cannot be achieved alone, but achieved as a group to accomplish goals and solve problems together.\n\nAmerica was not born as a result of one person. The most prominent example would be the Revolutionary War. Although many consider the win for America was all solely because of George Washington, the colonist's general, it was actually more, a lot more. The colonist's involvement in the success includes soldiers, farmers, etc. They provided supplies for the armies with food, weapons, etc. Even as a general, George Washington had lieutenants and other high officers that help recommended certain routes and ideas that helped the success of the war. The success of the Revolutionary War was achieved by many many people who helped accomplish the goals and solve the problems as a group.\n\nMany people think that only those whose accomplishment are truly their own can be claimed successful. On the contrary, as demonstrated in both fiction and history, real success can only be achieved by groups of people. Without the help of everyone involved, America would probably still be the 13 colonies. In the same manner, Harry Potter would not have survived even the first event of the Triwizard Tournament. As shown by the results of everyone who helped both George Washington and Harry Potter, real success can ONLY be achieved by supporters, advisers, and helpers along the way.

In other words,  maintaining a dynamic state of mind will allow one to fulfill one\u2019s goals. Throughout society and in life, the evidence to support this statement is pervasive.\n\nConsider \u201cEnder\u2019s Game\u201d by Orson Scott Card. The main protaganist Ender chose to join the Battle School at the tender age of 6 in order to protect civilization. After arrival at the space institution, Ender\u2019s first commander treated him like dirt, and did not let him even try to ameliorate himself.  However, Ender used his mind and was able to find companions that taught him the bare necessities to survive, and thus laid the foundation that allowed the future Ender to have the tools to save humanity. Ender was only able to prove himself because he used his brain to find a path out.\n\nNext consider the reign of terror in France, started by the Frenchman Robespierre. When Robespierre gained power, he decided he could not give mercy to people, and instead give out capital punishment to all wrongdoers. However, he became much too carried away and started executing over 4,000 people per day. This resulted with millions of casualties. Ironically, once Robespierre capitulated to the rebels, the executed him using his own instrument of destruction \u2013 the guillotine.  If Robespierre had been flexible and had decided to forgive people, he would not have met with his untimely death.\n\nIn my own life, I set up a lemonated stand to fundraise for Ekal Vidyalaya(an Indian charity), as well as for the Cleft lip foundation. It all started out well \u2013 our lemonade was aesthetically magnificent \u2013 yet I still encountered a large problem: I wasn\u2019t getting any customers! After the first three hours, we had only 8 customers visit our booth. I decided to put on my thinking cap, and came up with a creative attraction: music! I ran up to my house (located close by), got my viola, and started playing some breezy Disney themes. People got attracted by the music, and started listening to what the money from the stand would go towards. As a direct result of my flexibility, I was able to raise about $250 for each charity.\n\nAs Greg Easterbrook says, \u201cPeople who are uncompromising tend not to consider other peoples views\u2026All in all, it is better to be flexible.\u201d This statement is also shown to be true through \u201cEnder\u2019s Game\u201d in which Ender adapts to an uncomfortable situation yet is still able to prevail. The case of Robespierre is also able to show that people who are uncompromising tend to fail. Consequently, being flexible leads to a more harmonious and progressive society.\n\nThanks for your time! :)\n\n\nPS: Is it ok to BS if the judges can't tell? I mean, I did hold a lemonade stand for cancer and rose like 150-250 bucks, but the violin thing etc was total bull.

This is long, so you have been forewarned.\n\nTo begin: I'm 22, a rising senior, and while I may have a vast amount of strengths and qualifications in my own field (history), I have very few skills to none at all in regards to \"real life\" work experience. As a result, I can't find a stable job. And, here's the kicker: I'm deathly afraid of finding a job outside of my current field. I know, it's cowardice at its finest.\n\nAcademically, I maintain a 4.0 GPA, have completed an internship and have done extensive independent research, and have a very high reputation among my peers and professors. I am part of the history honors society, am an editor for the history department's journal (ranked top in the nation), and so forth. I am applying to doctoral programs in history this upcoming fall and plan to become a professor upon completing my Ph.D. My online work has been followed by organizations such as the George Eastman House (the Kodak archives) and the Smithsonian Center for Education and Museum Studies. I have been listed next to periodicals such as Lapham's Quarterly and LIFE. I know it may sound like I'm lying or embellishing my academic history, but I'm being completely dead honest. I am incredibly grateful and lucky for the amount of success that I've had in my own field, and I'm driven entirely by passion and sheer willpower. Essentially, I  feel like I have everything going for me when it comes to academics.  I have an insane amount of confidence in my own discipline, but still do my best to maintain a healthy dose of humility.\n\nMy work experience and \"real life\" experience, on the other hand, are equally pitiful. I've worked as a nanny for the past year, and am gradually becoming frustrated with the amount of unprofessionalism I've encountered among families (e.g. canceling at the last minute, promising steady work but withdrawing offers, ignoring my text messages and phone calls regarding scheduling for a week, then dismissing me, etc.). I work for several different families. On one hand, it's a fun job and I love working with these children, but I'm exhausted and frustrated from not knowing when exactly I work, how much I'll be earning each week, and so on. I'm paid quite well for what I do ($12/hour, under the table), but that's only great if I have a steady work schedule (which I do not have at the moment). With graduate school on the horizon, I need to bring in much more income and more hours, otherwise (apart from hopefully receiving full doctoral funding) I have no idea how I will maintain living on my own, possibly moving across the country, and sustaining financial stability and independence. I'm pretty scared. I don't want to lose any opportunities to cultivate my passion for studying history.\n\nI have little confidence when it comes to finding work outside of independent childcare (finding a job with an agency or school is quite difficult if you're not an early childhood education student or a liberal studies student) or in history (which lacks paid positions at my current level). I worked briefly as a hostess three years ago, but was laid off as a result of downsizing. At the time, I feel like I underperformed at the job (it was my first actual job). I'm worried that this work history will come back to haunt me, even though I can technically lop this position off of my resume. I know my lack of confidence doesn't necessarily help with looking for a job. I think I'm mostly scared of rejection, ruthless, judgmental employers (I know, it sounds dramatic, but at least I'm being honest), and not being good and/or competent enough even for minimum wage positions. I can \"fake\" confidence and interview well, but I still don't feel \"good\" enough.  I'm rarely \"rejected\" in academics or as a nanny, so I think that definitely contributes to this fear. Even if I face rejection in those fields, I tend to accept it and move on. If I'm rejected for a minimum wage job, it feels like I've been hit by a load of bricks. I hope I don't sound like an entitled, selfish, spoiled brat. I just wonder, why would these employers even want to hire me? They could care less about my academic achievements; essentially, I bring nothing to the table for them.\n\nMy family is growing increasingly disgruntled over the fact that I cannot find a \"real\" and stable job, and I understand it's because they care and want me to be successful. I'm growing frustrated myself. I don't know why, exactly, I feel so incompetent outside of history. I carry and articulate myself well, with grace and confidence, so I know many people would be shocked to find out that I don't feel \"good enough\" to apply for basic, minimum wage/entry-level positions. I think, in the end, I just feel like \"DO NOT HIRE HER\" is plastered on my forehead when I'm interviewing with employers, writing cover letters, and filling out applications. I know I have to throw myself into this bloodbath eventually, but I feel completely held back.\n\nI can't think of anything else to add, but any advice and/or encouragement? Please don't tell me to take this to a therapist - I'm looking for advice from my peers, as I've received plenty from a professional. Thank you for reading this novel of a post, I really appreciate it.

Thanks!\n\n\nMy essay:\n\n\u0093A census,\u0094 my statistics teacher explained, \u0093is nearly impossible to conduct in a large population because it requires you to communicate with every single member within it.\u0094 As soon as she uttered these words, I realized that issues of communication extend beyond the classroom, into my daily life as a student leader.\n\nIn tenth grade, I fell in love with playing basketball. Our school, however, did not allow us to join the Sports League of the Shanghai International Schools, so we had few chances to compete against other schools. In order to rectify this problem, I began to organize games between our school\u0092s and other international schools\u0092 teams. At first, I thought that the most difficult part of this task would be finding a venue for the competitions. After all, finding teams who were interested should be easy. Little did I realize, the challenges had only just begun.\n\nAfter settling on a suitable location, I realized that facilitating the communication between teams would be incredibly difficult. While I had found the teams I hoped would participate, finding the person in charge\u0097the person who could actually make any decisions\u0097was nearly impossible. The first person I approached always had to consult a second person, who then had to ask yet another person. And when I luckily happened upon the person in charge, the response was often negative. As a result, out of the dozen schools we had originally contacted, only five schools attended the competition.\n\nI then realized that the main problem that many of school\u0092s organizations faced could be boiled down to one point: communication. As a student, rather than a school official, I simply do not have the authority to contact other schools. As a result, most of our school\u0092s organizations remain small. In response, I devised a plan to establish a community that would bring together all of Shanghai\u0092s international high school students. I decided that the best way to create this sense of community was through a tangible object\u0096in this case, a magazine \u0096which students could easily share with their friends.\n\nLater that week, I met with a friend of mine to figure out the logistics of producing such a magazine. We talked with schools, edited articles, designed the layout, and found sponsors, partners, and a printing company. We went to different schools to publicize our creation. By September of this year, we had successful created Highlight, the first \u0096 and currently only \u0096 magazine geared toward the international school community in Shanghai.

I remembered how much it sucked, and how I wish there could be someone experienced to guide me through it. Since I have much sympathy for the people who are currently going through this period of extreme stress, I decided to write some advice I would have given myself if I were still a junior/senior.\n\n1. Stop making or thinking about making re-assuring threads on CC. Yeah, I know you want to make \"Chance me\" threads or something along the lines of \"Is this EC unique?\" \"Is my GPA too low?\" \"Will a high GPA/SAT make up for a low SAT/GPA?\" \"Does my competitive high school increase my chances?\" etc...\n\nStop it now. Remember that this site is filled with people who AREN'T college admissions officers. No matter how many posts they have or how much they claim to know about college admissions, CHANCES ARE, THEY ARE NOT DIRECTLY INVOLVED IN THE PROCESS SO IN REALITY THEY DON'T REALLY KNOW THAT MUCH. It's even worse when high schoolers -- people who are in the exact same boat as you -- try to give advice or \"chance\" someone. A CCer could write you a 5-page essay detailing your chances at your college choices, and it still won't mean crap in the end.\n\nWhen I was still a senior, I went crazy with making CC threads. Almost every other day, I would make \"chance me\" threads or threads asking about whether I could make up for my pitiful GPA in any way. I got a mix of responses, but the majority of them were negative. Most people would say that I had absolutely no chance of getting into any school besides my safety. I would get super depressed after seeing all those \"chances,\" because I thought that those people's opinions actually meant something. In the end, it didn't matter because I got into a reach school that I'm very very happy at right now.\n\nSo yeah, stop looking for reassurance by making pointless threads here.\n\n2. Stop trying to stack yourself up against your peers. I know a lot of you are guilty of this. You're thinking... \"My buddy Jose has a 2300, 3.85 GPA, and 35 ECs. I have a 2350, 3.9, and 37 ECs. I should wreck this kid. But crap... Emily has a 2360, 4.0, and 40 ECs. I should make a thread on CC called 'Which applicant would Harvard prefer?' and see if people will think I'm better.\"\n\nI used to be extremely guilty of this as well. I would always think about what my \"competition\" had -- their GPA, SAT, ECs, etc. and see how they would stack against me. In the end, none of that mattered of course, because a lot of the kids who I thought I was \"better\" than got into schools I got rejected from. And a lot of kids who were supposed to be \"better\" than me got rejected from schools I got into. Don't stack yourself up against everyone else, because it just makes you even more insecure about yourself.\n\n3. Stop treating the college admissions process like a competition where the winner is the person who gets into the \"best\" school. In other words, stop worrying about where your classmates do or don't get in and worry about where YOU get in. Because in the end, where you go to school is the only thing that matters.\n\nOk, so what if that pretentious d-bag in your grade who everyone hates got into Harvard? Good for him. So what if your friend got into Princeton when he didn't \"deserve it\" because of his low GPA? Good. For. Him.\n\nThinking about the college admissions process like a competition will only make it so much more stressful than it really is. Instead of working on creating the best possible result for yourself, you will be worrying about how everyone else will be doing. So even if you DO get into the best possible college for you, your happiness will still be affected by where everyone else got in. That's not good, so be selfish, and worry about you and your own needs first.\n\n4. Don't fall in love with a school. Yeah, I know that having a \"dream school\" will motivate you. But in the end, you still do have a very good chance of getting rejected, no matter how good you are (assuming your dream school is a top school). Have a bunch of schools that you LIKE AND WOULD BE HAPPY TO GO TO, but don't obsess over any particular schools.\n\nI remember when my \"dream school\" during senior year was UCLA. I would do anything to go there, and would even have dreams of myself being there. I would always obsess over it, and invested all my emotional energy on whether I got in or not. In the end, I got rejected. I became depressed after that. But today, I'm a freshman at a school I could never have pictured myself at last year, and I LOVE it. So keep your options open and don't focus on any particular schools.\n\n5. Don't save your apps for last minute. I remember writing my NYU essays on Christmas Eve. It sucked. And I didn't get in =[\n\n6. DO apply to some reach schools, even if you don't think you have a chance. That doesn't mean you should apply to all the Ivies + Stanford and no safeties if you have a 2.0 GPA, but applying to a couple reaches in addition to your list of matches and safeties won't hurt at all. I had a 3.15 UW GPA and top 40% class rank in high school, and I never could have imagined myself getting into any top 30 school, let alone the one I'm going to now. But I thought, \"Why not?\" and still gave it a try.\n\n7. Stop being a prestige-whore. I know a lot of you want to go to Ivies or any elite school because of the name. But please DO look into other important aspects of a school (such as social scene, atmosphere, etc) instead of just worrying about prestige. Pick a school that you will really enjoy, not a school whose only purpose is to give you bragging rights. I know some people who go to prestigious schools but would rather go to a less well-known school that would allow them to have more fun.\n\n8. Last but not least, stop surfing this site all the time. Asking a GOOD (ie. not some bull thread made only for reassurance) question once in a while is fine. But going on here all the time will only make you more stressed out as you see a bunch of losers crying about their \"pitiful' score of 2350 on the SAT.\n\nDuring my senior year, I went on this site literally every day. In the end, I can't name ONE positive thing I gained from that experience. If I had just relaxed, spent more time with friends and less time worrying about irrelevant crap, the results would have still been the same except with less stress involved in the process.\n\nSo... yeah. That's the advice I would give to any high schooler who's still going through this painful process. Good luck and happy holidays ^_^                "}, {"date": "2012-12-20T09:30:25+00:00", "url": "http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/multiple-degree-programs/1433131-sat-2050-is-bs-md-a-possibility-please-help.html", "messages": "\n                    My D wants to apply for combined Med Program and is a Junior this year.

We're not poor-poor, but definitely lower-middle-class. Dad is high-school; I've got a college degree (in Art!) so we are desperately scrambling to deal with the situation we are (fortunate) to be in, and hoping so much not to screw it up for our daughter because we know so little.\n\nDD, 16, is exceptionally smart; we homeschool and she has attended the local community college half-time since she was 14. Her professors -- unaware of her age -- have LOVED her; she's interactive and interested and has earned exceptional, ceiling marks even in the tough science classes. Several-no, most- have given or offered glowing letters of recommendation. She wants to be a doctor, and we always thought we'd eke out a 4-year local college transfer when she was 18 and cross fingers for scholarships. Reach schools? I'd never even heard of that. SAT II's? AP tests? First I'm hearing about it, right here. Ivies? Oh, that's for rich people, who have money for $35,000 preschools and SAT coaches. Not for us, to be sure! Not even in the realm of possibility!\n\nBut a school financial counsellor we talked to a few years ago mentioned that the Ivies might actually be *cheaper* than local colleges, at our income level. We never thought that really might be an issue -- there's a quite good city college within commute distance, with an attached medical school. The path was easy and straight forward.\n\nNow, dd has come up with a very good PSAT score, very likely Merit Scholarship. Without overstating its importance (really, it has not gone to my head) I see that reach schools (Ha! I know the term now!) are at least a possibility. I am trying to learn so much right now. We are looking into the AP tests, SAT II's and whatever, and everything seems up in the air. Without any direction or support we're so afraid of dropping the ball for her. I don't know a single thing about reach, probable or safety schools. Ivies are not a status thing for us -- we don't go to cocktail parties ;-) -- it's more that, if dd can contribute more by doing research in stem cells or whatever than being a family doctor, it's our obligation to help her get there so she can do it. But we need to do it without a mountain of debt.\n\nSo I guess I should end with questions. Which reach schools are most generous? Which are most highly esteemed for biological research? DD would be a junior in high school, if she were in school. We have transcripts of coursework covered, with no grades. (What would be the point?) And of course, she has her com. college transcript. What should we be doing right now? We are looking for AP tests she could do and a school where she could take them -- but homeschoolers are not necessarily welcome. How can we find out more? Help, help, help, we are so clueless.\n\n******\n\nThanks so much, especially Bclintonk -- I am reading a lot here, and panicking a *little* less. Thinking \"upscale\" is still so overwhelming. We are still completely unaware of typical admissions deadlines for early admit or standard (?) admit. From what we'd heard, her 4.0 community college credit history was enough to get her into what we figured was the school we'd be able to afford for her to attend (Wayne State in Detroit, we're in MI) so admissions and deadlines were never very relevant to us. That is reassuring what you've said about undergraduate studies; now I don't feel like I have to learn about *every* college *everywhere* that might give her the background she needs.\n\nWould not being an undergrad at a college with an outstanding medical school be an advantage, though? In being admitted to the med school later on, or in finding mentors for research or lab work that would be useful later on?\n\nOur very commonsense plan \"A\" was for Wayne State, followed by probably by a program to help with medical school expenses: a National Health Service program, the military... hard choices, and not the best ones, but she has known she was going to be a doctor since she was 4 and has never wavered from it. We are just trying to figure out how to get her there.\n\nBut the more I read the \"How to Get Into Ivies\" books - and I've got a small stack going now :-) - the more she sounds like the kind they want: a sweet, smart self-starter who contributes in her classes because she wants them to be stimulating. Last year she had a teacher - a PhD English Lit candidate clearly having a Basement of the Ivory Tower moment -- almost tearfully thank her for being such a good student, in the bathroom. She's had other \"WOW\" moments from her other professors, too.\n\nWe had her take the SAT when she was 13 to see if she was ready for college, and as I recall, she did well even for someone older. We didn't really fully understand the results, and at the time, it wasn't really important, it was just for our info -- but I could dig up the results if it would help gauge her chances at the selective colleges.

Is it unnecessary?\n\nESSAY:\n\nAgatha Christie was correct, these days everything is spoon-fed to us. Sometimes individuals don't even recognize this failure, but, it has seeped so far into our beings that it would take a conscious effort to inverse it. We believe that we hear and then reciprocate that information to others. It becomes a vicious cycle that results in unoriginal thoughts and ideas. How do we expect to become wiser and a fresh influence on this world?\n\nThe entertainment industry these days aptly displays this concept. We become sucked into character's lives via movies and television and thus can't live and breath unadulteratedly. We have a unquenchable thirst to be amused. Do you know that that word actually means? The root is \"not to think\". Many people can't fathom how much this aspect of popular culture affects out lives today.\n\nSimilarly, as a girl, I see many peers salivate over the latest perfect pumps or the dress you could die for. they spend their time hoping and wishing for something they don't have and being pressured that if they don't have the Gucci handbag they are somehow inferior. You can't let celebrities and ad agencies dictate what you think - even what you wear.\n\nWhether it's grabbing the newest addition to Kim Kardashian's clothing line or gasping over the latest perfect movie scene...we are interlaced with common culture so consequentially that we cannot love and live our own lives.

I am always anxious. I am a first year college student and am very depressed. I come from a small town on the east coast in which I had a large friend group and loving and supporting parents. At first I was surviving in college, figuring my way around the campus and meeting new people and deffinately made a few friends and many acquantences in my dorm. Anxiety over being surrounded by new people kept me from joining or going to any new club meetings, and I used my small group of friends as a crutch to lean on. And things continued with some correspondence with home, classes, and some friends to hang out with. The year progressed and I noticed I was marking time until I could spend more time at home with my \u0093true friends\u0094 and I continued in this mind state right up until about the long Christmas break during which I started to think about the next time I would be home. I realized spring vacation was only 7 days long so I began thinking about the NEXT time I would be home and then it dawned on me, that the majority of my time would be spent here for a foreseeable future. When I cam back to college I became bogged down in this discovery. The new schedule and changes in my rooming situation made me realize which relationships actually stuck and which ones didnt, and suddenly my social life shrank even more form its diminished state to the point where I realized I only had two \u0093friends\u0094 on campus. I realized I was not involved in anything besides my classes. I also realized that my home and my huge friendgroup back there is changing and they will all be moving on with their lives and growing up. So the daily correspondence with parents began, and the counseling sessions. All this has helped me think through and come to grips with my sadness and anxiety. As a result I have made and effort to email different departments and sign up for new clubs and drag my ass off to parties on the weekends in hopes of finding a direction and meeting people and I have. However I still feel crippled by this anxiety over the future and losing my friends at home and not having the ideal college experience that I had always dreamed of. I come back to my dorm from my morning class and feel lonely and directionless and unable to change it. If I hear noise in the hallway or the voice of an acquaintance I feel socially anxious and jealous like \u0093that should be me out there having a good time and communicating with people and filling my life with activity\u0094. The result is that I find myself watching other people to quantify what I SHOULD be doing with my free time. When I sit in my room alone now the fear and sadness and anxiety over all of these issues and the change occurring in my life mount until I have a panic attack. What\u0092s worse is that I feel I cannot just leave my room and feel better because I have nowhere to go nothing to do and no one to do it with. My relationships with my two remaining friends have become parasitic because I am always sad and anxious and they are the only people with whom I can talk about this, and this same sadness and anxiety dominates my interaction with the rest of campus as well which cripples me and severely influences other people\u0092s impressions of me. I was a sociable kid and never had much of an issue with making friends in the past, but all these concerns and the new environment have made this process and life in general like reading latin or doing brain surgery-very complicated. I find myself way overthinking my interactions with other people  and unable to or unsure of how to progress relationships. Even when I meet a nice person who seems chill and asks for my number I can never hit them up to hang out or anything because I get bogged down in the question \u0093what is there to do?\u0094 haha its funny to say but friendship is no longer as simple as a playdate, but it has become about shared goals and experiences and interactions in a calm and unthreatening environment. Like idk, if you meet someone and chill for a bit, and then you see them again at the student radio station. You and that person now have something in common and place to go. I know I\u0092m overthinking things, and that is part of the problem. I can\u0092t seem to escape these feelings of sadness, anxiety, fear, and hopelessness no matter where I go or who I am with. I can\u0092t even be comforted when Home anymore because I know I have to come back to this place and I\u0092ll be right back in the same boat. I know I have to make change and I am trying but I don\u0092t know what to. All I want to do is give up and go home and be with my friends but I know that they wont be there for much longer and at this point everyday I get older and closer to the time when I should be striking out independently and starting my life away from home. I feel like I cannot escape this transition that has started and that it was something I underestimated and was deffinately not ready for at the beginning of this school year, Like maybe I should have taken a Gap year and grown up a bit and then gone off to college. The only people letting me know that it will be alright are my parents but I know that I am becoming more and more perceivable as an adult by the world and am coming close to a point where I can no longer live at home and have to advocate for myself. I am so lost and confused and hopeless. Has anyone else ever felt this way? Any success stories? Does it get better? I\u0092m putting in all this effort into being \u0093happy\u0094 but it isn\u0092t working. I am never happy anymore. Help please!!!!

Among the top schools academically, with amazing nightlife and endless events on campus, including sporting events and neat things put on by student organizations.\n\nBut what you can't see on paper is the student experience:  the amazing opportunities available here, partially as a result of our location and partially as a result of our leadership.\n\nHere's a brief glance into that.\n\nI just got out of a seminar. The seminar is large, with about 20 students, but every lecture a student gives a presentation (for the whole period) and leads a discussion. Today was my presentation, and it was on a book by Richard Dawkins (only the most famous living biologist, in case you didn't know). I had seen him during my sophomore year when he visited and gave a presentation in the philosophy department, and I met him last night. Last night I was at a professor's house for dinner, and the guest of honor was - you guessed it - Richard Dawkins.\n\nShortly before I gave my presentation on Richard Dawkins' book, I received an email informing me that he would be in class today. I got an email telling me that the most famous biologist in the world would be watching me present on his book.\n\nIt was fantastic. He participated in the discussion, and engaged with the points I made (I was a little bit critical of some of the points he made in his book). It was a ton of fun, and I just have to think to myself, how many students have this opportunity? Dawkins, upon learning about our class, actually rescheduled a meeting with a Professor in another department to come and meet with us (Last night, at the dinner, he spent a large portion of his time hanging out with us students, too. I don't know if he tried the baklava that I made (it was a pot-luck))\n\nRichard Dawkins will also be giving a lecture to all the students at the University on Thursday evening, and he will be holding office hours for Biology students throughout the week.\n\nDawkins. Amazing.\n\nMoving on, a few weeks ago I had the privilege of attending a lecture by Justice Anthony Kennedy. A week before that, I attended a lecture by Justice Sonia Sotomayor, during which she walked throughout the audience, attempting to connect to us students. She leaned on my shoulder twice throughout the presentation. Before that, I spent half an hour in a room with her and about 10 other students. During this time period we were able to ask her questions about her role on the Supreme Court and her life. Before that, I got to meet her, shake her hand, and she signed two of her books (with a personal note for me), and she told me a bit about what her book meant to her.\n\nKennedy. Sotomayor. Amazing.\n\nA little while before that, President Obama was on campus THREE TIMES in order to campaign. Mitt Romney visited campus TWICE. All five visits were for the presidential candidates to speak with students.\n\nOf course, most UM Students had already seen President Obama speak when he visited campus the year before. This visit, of course, was a week after Bill Clinton visited campus to lecture to President Shalala's class (yes, the President of the university teaches a class, didn't you know? She's kind of an expert on healthcare... she was, after all, the former secretary of Health and Human Services). Of course, the students in her class had probably seen Bill Clinton already, too - when he was here the year before for his Clinton Global initiative, in which he brought world leaders from all over the world (big names, like the current secretary of H&HS, the current Surgeon General, etc.) to the University of Miami to meet with students.\n\nClinton. Obama. Romney. Amazing.\n\nOf course, shortly after the Clinton Global Initiative we had Condoleezza Rice visit campus for a business forum, and just a few months later the Dali Lama came and spoke to students.\n\nCondoleezza Rice. The Dali Lama. Freaking Amazing.\n\nThe funny thing is that this little spiel comes no where close to describing the full amazingness of my time at the University. There is no way that I could put into words the amazing experiences that I have had with my friends over the past four years, or the feeling when I said my first words over WVUM (to the potential listener based of over 5,000,000 people). I can't describe the feeling when I watched my first UM football game, and, in the last few seconds watched my team halt FSU FOUR TIMES within 10 yards of a touchdown, preventing a loss.\n\nThe purpose of this isn't to brag or show off my experiences. The purpose is to show off the experiences that YOU will have the opportunity to participate in if you come to the University of Miami.\n\nThe past four years have been amazing. In just a few months, I will be leaving UM to attend one of the best law schools in the country. Yet, I am sure that, there, I will look back and think about all of the amazing experiences that I had at the University of Miami which can not possibly be had elsewhere.\n\nMy only regret is that I have to leave in just two months.\n\nIf any future potential students have any questions for me, I am happy to ask them, either here or on a one-on-one basis.

I had been having serious problems for about 5 years before I finally blew a gasket completely; all of this IMO was precipitated by a bad divorce and pretty much everything I cared about falling apart. Regardless, when I was in the middle of my collapse, I was in the early stages of obtaining a Masters Degree in Public Health with a specialty in Epidemiology.\n\nI had a lot of trouble getting any effective treatment, and the VA psychiatrist I was seeing after I lost my medical insurance pulled me off some of my medication. Results were bad; started having blackouts and ended up arrested for the first time in my life. I managed to pull myself together enough to explain the medical situation I was in but it was ignored. The situation got worse afterwards and resulted in a charge for assault on a public servant.\n\nAfter all the details of the situation came to light (medical records and no criminal history), I was basically given a pass (deferred adjudicated probation for five years assuming I didn't have any more problems). Fast forward a year and a half, I've pretty much got myself back together. The only problem is anything even remotely in my plans as far as education, employment, even renting an apartment is severely hampered by the arrest record.\n\nI would give just about anything to be able to resume and complete my education, but I cannot see how there would be much purpose in it if I cannot become employed afterwards. At the moment, I'm stuck in the middle: Overqualified for almost anything that would overlook an arrest record for that serious a charge, and not qualified for anything else that I could actually use my education and skill set for due to the arrest record.\n\nI saw some slightly related questions on the net, and figured that I didn't have anything to lose by asking about it here. Does anyone have any possible useful advice for me other than stop wasting my time?

As a relatively new poster, I apologize to the extent this is going over old terrain.\n\nLet me admit that I've had a decal on my car and just added one in recent days.  I cannot help noticing them on my daily 45-60 minutes to work and then back.  If there is some particularly elite combo (i.e. MIT, Yale, Wellesley) and/or unusual decal (i.e Rhodes, Whitman or Willamette when I am in MA), I have to think if I will take a glance or not when passing or passed.  And in thinking about this I've realized that I rarely if ever noticed prior to my oldest being a high school soph or so.\n\nInstead of arguing about whether there many of us are interested in where our kids go, preparing them for elite options, hoping for elite options, etc, for the sake of argument I am going to assume there is a lot of truth here.  Particularly disturbing to me, which we see in many of the these comparison threads as kids are up against it to make a final choice, is how often even fairly elite options can be disparaged or relatively belittled in contrast to some allegedly superior choice.  This of course feeds the beast and the overall zeitgeist about these matters that then feeds the anxiety and neurosis about desiring and getting in elite schools.  I've seen this happen with schools of the ilk of Michigan, Vanderbilt, Tufts, Bowdoin, Amherst, Colgate, Colby, Kenyon, Northeastern, etc, etc, or even with Ivies pitted against each other or some other high level non-Ivy.\n\nSo just as I have seen in athletics with kids being pushed into college visits as early as 8th and 9th grade and pushed to think about majors by 9th or 10 grade, we see kids at younger and younger ages asking what schools are best for architecture or electrical engineering, or whatever.  Even within the past couple of weeks I've seen 14 and 15 years asking for college lists (elite of course).  The stuff about parents scheming for elite pre-schools is well-documented, so I won't belabor all of that, but the game has become so difficult, and so LINEAR, that there is no breathing room to, well, be a kid, to explore, screw up, experiment with different paths and different strains of identity.  As I write this, I know tons has been written about about all this, but apparently there has been no effect.  I know this is the STEM age, but should 16 and 17 year olds already be declaring their very specific career paths and applying to particular units of particular schools (Ross, Stern, Tepper, COE, BME, etc, etc).  It's dizzying.  I know there are some kids so talented that they can rise above, in spite of what I am talking about, and still be very specialized while also developing into incredible people.  But again, I think this is in spite of....and MOST regular talented kids I fear can't do that.\n\nWhat are the alternatives?  Well, the risk of not being caught up in the prestige, score and gpa enchancement, EC enhancement, laser focus, laser focus, private coaches, etc, etc is that you very well may be marginalized.  If you're not participating in the \"language\" of the prevailing culture here then you risk being outside entirely, not existing.  So we've got an obsession that we are afraid not to participate in that is still eating us up.  We've got kids applying to 25-30 schools, kids with 4.0s and 2400s actually not getting in their dream schools or even a handful of dream schools, and threads like Parents Using College Acceptances to Compete, parents parsing through data and marking a notch against schools if the 4 year grad rate is too low, etc.\n\nAnd what is happening in high school is getting repeated in college.  What should I do, where should I go, and what classes should I avoid to make sure I maintain or exceed the 3.8 I need to access med school.  Strategizing and dodging, and perpetual resume focus dominate.  There is no incentive to veer off the path.  In fact, you will be punished harshly if you veer off the path, unless, you can explain that real or metaphorical 6 months off as somehow another notch in the belt for the resume.\n\nSo, sure, there's a narcissistic element here.  But there's also a real fear...fear that not participating will result in not being relevant at all...ending up outside, on the sidelines of relevance.\n\nI have no idea what the answers are.  I just know it seems like it's getting worse all the time and that the dynamic ultimately is carnivorous and unsustainable.\n\nBut cheers!

This was on April 30th, I never received a reply.\n\nI understand their office must be under immense strain with all they requests they receive, but... The spring semester is over in one week.\n\nBeing the paranoid kinda guy that I am, I thought perhaps he was waiting until the spring grades posted to see if I \"deserved\" more aid.

If you could perhaps inform me of what kind of school I could be getting into as well as any possible scholarship, that would be just dandy. If not. I don't hate you. I swear.\n\nAnyways, let me first discuss my grades and the like. I'm a junior in high school, attending a school in the East County of San Diego, CA. My weighted GPA at the moment is a 4.31 (I would have to find my unweighted GPA...so if you need that, holla and I'll help you out), with nearly all As, some Bs, and a C. However, at the end of this semester, I will in all likelihood be receiving a D in a class, as well as a possible C (I'm staging a intervention with the teacher on behalf of the entire class on Thursday morning, in which I will be presenting the class' case to have an easier grading scale; only one person has an A). Now I realize that the Cs and possible D will be exceedingly detrimental, however I am able to defend why I got those grades, which I will get to in just a wee bit.\n\nExtra-Curricularly, I'm fairly strong in my own very unbiased opinion, however if you would like to inform me of otherwise please go right ahead. I was the co-captain of the CIF San Diego Section champion Cross Country team (and will be sole captain this coming year), am an individual state qualifier and competitor in Cross Country, and am the best 3200 meter runner from the school (11th in the county) as a junior. I also am a member of the School Site Council, the School Climate Council, the WASC (accreditation) council, wrote the School Site Goals (with my principle), went to Boy's State (or am going in a week), went to the Rotary Youth Leadership Awards, and am an instrumental member and frequent volunteer of the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation's San Diego Chapter. I am also a member of multiple, miscellaneous clubs at the school and do occasional motivational public speaking.\n\nAs for college essays and letters of recommendation, I am fairly certain to be receiving a letter from my principle (we tight yo) as well as the AP Literature Teacher and the former Humanities teacher, all eloquent writers. As for my own essay, I have the terminal illness Cystic Fibrosis (Cystic fibrosis - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia), which has plagued me with illness, hampered my running (I have athletic induced bronchiospasms, the equivalent of asthma attacks, at every race and nearly thrice weekly every workout), and requires almost four total hours of devotion to medications morning and night (two in the morning, two at night). This has resulted in difficulty in strictly \"practice\" based courses (such as Mathematics...so the D) as well as attendance. I feel like I could use this story to my advantage (which I actually feel bad about abusing and may not use due to my morality) in an application essay.\n\nTesting still is lacking in its statistics. I only have the results of one AP test (AP Euro my sophomore year, a 4 and tied for highest in the class) and have yet to take my ACT nor SAT, however I have taken the PSAT and scored a 210 with no studying (and when I say no studying, I mean I didn't even know the format of the test going in). The AP tests I took this year (AP Bio, Art History, US History, and Lit) I feel will all be four or fives, with the exception of Biology, which I feel was either a three or four.\n\nSocio-Economically, I am a Caucasian male, from a middle class family under the financial burden of two children with Cystic Fibrosis. I don't work yet...but will this summer.\n\nSo again, I was wondering if what colleges you think I could get into, as well as if perhaps any scholarship money could come my way. And most importantly, I was wondering if I gave an explanation of my soon to be D (difficulties making up coursework and studying due to illness and absence), if it would be as detrimental.\n\nAlso, I was wondering how rigorous of a schedule I should take for next year. I'm planning on 6 classes with 5 APs, however, I also think it could be detrimental to my health. HOW important is the strength of schedule for my senior year, is what I'm really asking.\n\nThanks for all your time and interest and love. Because I know you gotta love me. Because I forgot to mention, I'm also quite dashing. And perhaps a tad bit conceited.

In May, I wrote the following essay and got an 8/12. Each reader gave me a 4. I was surprised because the result was far from my expectations. Anyways, I wrote down the essay (from the actual essay in my score report) and pasted it on Collegeboard's Online Course essay grader. I got a 12!\nIn my opinion, the discrepancy is shocking. And I thought maybe someone here could please tell me whether my essay deserved an 8. Thank you.\nHere's the essay (I kept the grammatical mistakes):\n\nIt is common to see human beings satisfying urgent needs and pleasures rather than devoting their energy into planning for the future. Being a computer science fan, I subscribe to the notion that musing on an algorithm is more praiseworthy than coding. Weeks of planning can save you months of coding, as one anonymous source is credited for. Preparing for the future is crucial in our lives. Several examples from real life and literature demonstrate this.\n\nSteve Jobs was one of the most highly venered and praised man of the twenty first century. Because of his visions and future-planning, he made his company one of the best computer-producing entreprises. Steve Jobs was the chairman and cofounder of Apple Inc, which has a gain of billions of dollars every year. It was because of his vision that he succeeded, as ABC.net.au's \"Visionary Steve Jobs succumbs to cancer\" paper says. He looked into the future, thinking about what would people like, unlike Dell which was criticized by Steve Jobs for creating \"unimaginative biege boxes\". Steve Jobs said that he goes not where the plum is but where it will be. Such vision and looking into the future is what allowed Steve Jobs to be one of the most remarkable men in the 21st century.\n\nHiroshima by John Hersey is a novel that describes a community that suffered from the deadly effects of the atomic bomb, but never lost its resilience. The survivors of the atomic bomb demonstrated that looking into the future of their society is more productive than looking at the bleak present. Whenever faced with an obstruction, one should turn it into an opportunity because if one doesn't, the future will only be grimmer. One of the survivors, Mr. Fujii, instead of reconnecting with his family after the bomb, he ignored everyone and went to enjoy his life. He only thought about the luxuries of the present. And as a result of carelessness, he died lonely and detested by the people around. Father Kleinsorge, serving as a foil, thought about the future of Japanese society, and he cared. Although a German, he made friendly relations with the Japanese priests in Hiroshima. After the bomb went off, he went to help others in Asano Park. He made ties with Miss Sasaki and the Kataoka children. His example is a paragon of patience that allows one to foresee what the future holds. Hiroshima demonstrates that thinking only about the future always has negative consequences, but preparing for the future is more important.\n\nKing Lear is another novel that shows how small and rash decisions can affect the future greatly. King Lear was a figure that represented order and a rigid heirarchy in Britain. Everything and everyone was in peace, if not harmony. But then, one day, he decided to hand off his power to his two daughters, Golerin and Regan. He would regret that decision for his entire life. The country devolved into civil strife and war. Many, like Gloucester, criticized very scathingly King Lear's decision. King Lear, the novel, shows that rationality and preparedness for the future is more important.\n\nPreparing for the future, instead of the present, is undoubtedly more important.

My scores aren't exceptional scores compared to the average CC'er, but I raised them exactly 200 points so I thought I might help those few souls looking for the boost :)\n\nMY SCORES:\nPSAT: 62R, 76M, 68W\n\nJanuary 2013- 670R, 710M, 690W (10 essay) = 2070\n\nJune 2013- 680R, 790M, 800W (11 essay) = 2270\n\nOkay, so December of my junior year I took maybe 3-4 practice tests out of the Blue Book, and definitely amped up my vocabulary studying. What really helped me with vocabulary was my method of studying. I don't like just memorizing words and definitions, so I wrote short stories (maybe 200 words or less each) and inserted at least 10 new vocabulary words into the story. After writing the story, I would rewrite the definitions and make flash cards for them. It really helped me to remember them in context of the story that I created. I made up a passage every day, and reread my past passages before I made the new one, which helped even MORE. This method was enjoyable (I like writing) and profitable. I never missed a single sentence completion question on my CR- it was mainly the reading passages that killed me for some reason. It's weird because the AP Lang test seems to have much harder passage questions, but I ended up with a 5 on that test in May 2013, so I'm not exactly sure why I didn't improve in CR this time around.\n\nI took Princeton's 11 SAT book and basically did random sections whenever I could. I practiced a lot of math sections, and got used to the ways that they \"tricked\" you. I'm somewhat of a math person so I didn't have to learn more math, but I had to just be clever to get those few tough questions in each section. The silly mistakes are what REALLY got me- which is why I only got 710. Writing was the same, mainly silly mistakes. But also only a 10 on the essay.\n\nSo, I studied a lot before the January test by doing practice tests over and over again, studying vocab, and taking full length tests every Saturday morning before the test for a month. I got the 2070 and was super disappointed. I couldn't understand why I didn't make it past 2100 even after ALL that practice. It was pretty much the same as my PSAT score.\n\nBy this time (well into March) I was getting busy with AP tests, and I pretty much ceased all studying for the SAT. I studied AP for March through May, and after that I had a mere two and a half weeks to prepare for the June SAT which I had signed up for. I felt unprepared and I braced myself to get the same score as before. But I read some forums and came up with a new way to prepare. Here's what changed:\n\n1. PRACTICE TESTS\n\nEvery time I took a practice test before, the second I was done with the test I would eagerly check the answers, add up my score, and check the results. After checking the results I would just glance at the questions I made mistakes on and sigh with frustration for each mistake. I would then leave to go relieve the lost 4 hours of the morning. My mistake was that I wasn't looking at ALL the questions, wrong AND right. I was only checking the ones that were wrong. You need to set a time to thoroughly go through all the questions and determine why you got that question right or wrong. I even went to the extent of writing it down in a notebook- numbering for each question and leaving a line of space to comment on the grammar rule, math fact, or text in the passage that made my answer right or wrong. This way, you are forced to learn from your mistakes and be careful not to do them again. This is somewhat time consuming, but it really helps. In the span of 2 and a half weeks I took maybe 3 practice tests. Also, I practiced random sections from princeton whenever I had a half an hour of spare time- I also corrected those and evaluated my answers.\n\n2. DON'T FILL IN THE BUBBLE IMMEDIATELY AFTER EACH QUESTION\n\nThis is CRUCIAL. It helped me the MOST. Before, when I took the test I would pick an answer, then bubble it in. Next question, repeat. This is TIME CONSUMING and DISTRACTING. It takes your focus and concentration away. Instead, I started circling the correct answers on the page itself (for all the sections). Once I got to the end of the page, no matter how many questions there were, I would make sure and bubble in the answers from that page. It was MUCH FASTER and it didn't break your concentration. When I used this strategy on the writing section for my June test, I finished in 20 minutes out of the given 30. I didn't miss a single one and I got an 800. It was extremely efficient. It gave me time to look back over all my answers and check everything. Trust me, at first trying this method will feel weird, but as you practice with it (and MAKE SURE to practice with it on your practice tests. Don't walk in to the testing room and try it out for the first time)\n\n3. Improve your essay writing\n\nI'm a good essay writer, so I can't offer much help here, but I will say that you should get as many examples as you can that are relevant and TRY TO MAKE YOUR ESSAY LONGER. I think that's what gave me my jump from 10 to 11. I wrote a 5 paragraph essay the 2nd time around, and that may have been what did it.\n\n4. MATH-USE #2 AND THE SAVED TIME TO CHECK YOUR WORK!!\n\nALWAYS check your work when possible!! Don't just sit there and look around if you finish early! I saved myself SO MANY TIMES on the June test by finishing early (somehow you get extra time using #2) and checking my work. It saved me from the stupid mistakes that I made earlier.\n\n5. POSITIVE ATTITUDE!\n\nDon't go in there hating on the SAT. I was actually excited to take it the day of the test. After all, the SAT is kind of like a game isn't it? I was in a good mood the day of the test, not at all nervous, and maybe that's what helped too.\n\nOkay, that's all I can think of. But I used these methods for studying AND test performance, and that's what raised my score so thoroughly and unexpectedly! I hope this helps :) "}, {"date": "2013-08-18T15:13:58+00:00", "url": "http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/sat-preparation/1543078-can-someone-grade-my-sat-essays-and-point-out-my-errors-and-how-i-can-improve-please.html", "messages": "\n                    Hi!

That is, what dangerous misconception do people commonly hold?\n\nWe human are a lazy kind. In many frustrating situations, we try to sought out the easy way for a gainful result. Violence, one of the most hackneyed method to achieve our goal, is not the answer to problems, like many may believe.\nOver the course of history, many bloody and violent acts resulted in more problems and deaths. The French Revolution is a perfect example. The peasants and the middle-class of France suffered decades from the tyrannical reign of the monarchs. Anger broil as the king continually requests heavy taxing from starving peasants for his own sybarite lifestyle. The rebels sought the immediate and easy answer for the French Revolution - violence. After the king were overthrown and the aristocrats bloodily slaughtered, the peasants and middle-class soon find themselves in the hold of another tyrant as the Reign of Terror starts. Thus, it shows that violence does not solve the existing problems for the French but increased their predicament.\nGhandi and the French peasants had a similar goal in mind-to overthrow an existing government. In India, Ghandi saw the way the British government abused the Indians and robbed them of their capitals. He sought independence. However, unlike the French, Ghandi used a more difficult way to achieve independence- civil disobedience and non-violent acts. Ghandi persistently insisted to suffer abuse and violence from the government without \"hitting back\". His choice of method made him suffer and starve for a long durantion of time. However, everything was paid back as India regained its independence soon after and was rid of any tyrannical rules.\nIn conclusion, even though violence may seem like a quick and easy way out for many problems, it is, indeed, actually an aggravator for more disasters.

I have a lot of questions about the essay because I really want to get a 12 but I am not sure how, because all the \"guides\" I have read have pretty contradictory advice. One of the biggest questions I have is how to start the introductory paragraph. All the test prep books I have read basically tell you to restate the prompt, but then I have also read other sources that have clearly said \"don't do that!\" because the grader already knows the prompt and would rather read a nice hook instead. I usually write with a hook, but sometimes it's really hard for me to think of one depending on the prompt and it would be much easier just to restate the prompt. I also am not sure whether I should list out all my three points in the thesis statement or if I should just say \"blank is bad\" and leave the points for the body. I think you're supposed to do the former but I always just feel like I'm repeating myself when I list the points in the thesis statement and then go onto my body.\n\nAnyway, here is one practice essay I wrote in thirty minutes. Sorry if it's bad but I'd appreciate if you guys read it and give me some pointers. Thanks!\n\n******************************************************************\n\nWhat has America come to? The nation famous for both its principles of freedom and liberty, as well as its reputation as a \u201cmelting pot\u201d  has now become a country that is considering implementing a required reading curriculum consisting only of \u201cgreat books,\u201d or books written only by white, European authors. As this proposal already violates two of the most important facets of the fabric of this nation, it is very clear that forcing \u201cgreat books\u201d into the national curriculum would be an overwhelmingly detrimental action.\n\nForcing a set of books to be taught in every school is a blanket approach that not only oversteps the American freedom of choice but also impedes education and hurts students.  This is an especially relevant concern in diverse school districts. For example, in an area with a large immigrant population, teachers might want to assign books that come from many different cultures as a way to educate students about practices different from their own, in However, since there are only 180 days of the school year and teachers must teach the \u201cgreat books\u201d first, it is unlikely they will have enough time to teach the other novels, thus resulting in a cookie-cutter education that is not adjusted for the diverse needs of each school district.\n\nIn fact, many studies have shown that students who are exposed to more international articles, readings, and literature in school are more tolerant of different races and cultures. More tolerant students results in a less racist, more peaceful society, where people of many different backgrounds can coexist, which of course, is imperative in such a multicultural nation like the United States. Therefore, if students are only taught, \u201cgreat books\u201d which are only written by white, European authors, they will only be exposed to the white, European viewpoint. This is detrimental in two ways. White students will only gain understanding of their own culture which could lead to ignorance, even intolerance of other cultures. Non-white students may get the idea that white is the norm and that their cultures have little place in American society. Schools are, after all, some of the largest influences on the ideas and viewpoints of young people. If schools only teach white, European-based material, students will begin to believe that society is only white and European based.\n\nSome may argue that \u201cgreat books\u201d are classics and familiarity with these classics is essential to a well-rounded education. It is true that \u201cgreat books\u201d are typically well-written, highly profound novels. However, this line of thinking is flawed because these European \u201cgreat books\u201d are not the only well-written and profound novels in the world. There are countless other novels that are just as well-written and have the added benefit of providing cultural enrichment. Considers novels such as \u201cThings Fall Apart\u201d by  Chinua Achebe, a novel examining the gradual changes of a Nigerian tribal society or \u201cThe Water Margin\u201d an extremely famous and influential Chinese historical novel. These novels may not be \u201cclassics\u201d in the traditional sense, as our ideas have been permeated by a Eurocentric attitude and we only think of European novels, but they are just as groundbreaking and valuable to today's student as the \u201cgreat books\u201d are, AND they also provide insight into other cultures, as well.\n\nTherefore, the idea that \u201cgreat books\u201d are essential to a good education can be shown to be incorrect in a multitude of ways. Forcefully implementing these novels is firstly, an authoritarian and cookie-cutter approach that does not meet the needs of every school. Reading novels from countries outside of Europe is also extremely beneficial because it exposes American students to new ideas from different cultures, thus increasing tolerance. After all, as famous and well-written the \u201cgreat books\u201d are, there are multitudes of equally great books from all over the world that can truly broaden the minds of students, because not only are they unconventional choices, they are also just as well written. Students need exposure to different novels from different cultures all over the world in order to achieve a more well-rounded and cosmopolitan worldview. After all, shouldn't the American mantra be \u201cdiversity is the secret to a successful society?\u201d\n\n**********************************************\n\nI have actually written a lot more practice essays but this one is one I had some trouble on and almost didn't finish in the time limit. Didn't get to really proofread either.\n\nAlso, lol, I'm not American either so all these ACT prompts really confound me sometimes because I have no idea how to talk about \"freedom\" in an American way, which seems to be really important in writing a good essay based on these \"government is doing so and so\" prompts.

Tell us about a time in your life when you experienced disappointment, or faced difficult or trying circumstances.  How did you react?\n\nOriginally, I got into more detail about the internship program I was in, but it was getting very lengthy, so I had to cut that bit off (thus, the essay may need transitions as some points) but please let me know how it is.  Be completely honest and as of now it is 600 some words (needs cutting).  And also, please let me know if I made my internship experience sound too insignificant beacuse I wanted to get across the point of my dissappointment compared to my expectations, but I still wanted to show that it's a special experince.\n\nActual essay:\n\nArmed with a micropipette in one hand and a lab notebook in the other, I have always imagined myself in the future as a biologist; I would make great strides in biological research\u0085finding a cure for cancer and AIDS and the slew of mental disorders (if time permits, of course).  I love biology and have been fascinated by the subject since an early age.  When I was in elementary school, I would pour over any zoological book or magazine I could obtain and learn as much as I could about animals, plants, and other living organisms.  In high school, my schedule geared towards the sciences; a day would simply fell incomplete if about half the day wasn\u0092t dedicated to science.  Though I always feel this amazing rush when I solve a particularly complicated physics or chemistry problem, nothing supercedes the eureka moments when a biological concept suddenly makes sense.  Biology never fails to fascinate me; there have been several instances when my mouth just drops open with awe, enthralled by how perfectly everything seems to come together and function.  Filled with these lofty ideas and a love for biology, I naturally headed into my selective Howard Hughes Medical Institute sponsored internship at the National Institutes of Health light-hearted and excited.\n\nIt was certainly a plunge into reality when my mentor led me to my work area, an office, and began describing my daily tasks.  \u0093Well, I want to involve you in all aspects of the research.  We scan on Wednesdays, and you can accompany Margo on Tuesdays to help give the tests.\u0094  I began to grow uneasy; the \u0093tests\u0094 seemed reassuring though.  These tests had to involve lab work.  \u0093I\u0092ll try to get you started on the imaging data as soon as I can, and here, you can get started on updating this database.  Any questions?\u0094  Well I believe that you neglected to show me where the lab was, and what real work I would be doing.\n\nWhile my fellow interns talked of their lab work and complained about the vast number of PCRs they had to perform, I remained silent, ashamed that my internship seemed where near as exciting as their experiences.  My research focuses on the subconscious learning patterns of schizophrenic patients in comparison to normal subjects, and involves a good deal of computer work and data analysis; I usually help process data and give learning tests to patients and subjects.  All in all, I initially felt cheated out of a worthwhile internship experience.  How would I ever become a renowned biologist?\n\nAppreciation for my work didn\u0092t come immediately or in a sudden, miraculous epiphany; it came slowly as I begun to fully comprehend my research.  Aligning fMRI scans of the brain requires as much precision as loading gels; data received from the tests given to the subjects is just as valid and valuable to scientific research as the results obtained from a Western Blot.  And wow\u0085how many high school students have the opportunity to work with brain scans and learn how to run MRI machines?  Most of all, though, I have learned that studying the areas of the brain activated by subconscious learning is, contrary to what I had believed earlier, actual work and real research.\n\nThough I would have liked to have lab experience in my internship, it is no longer a necessity.  I may be a biological researcher in the future and be able to conduct lab research for the rest of my life, but I would also have liked to dabble in other areas to experience how work is conducted in different fields so that I will be perfectly content with my career in the future, since I would have expended all the potential \u0093what ifs.\u0094  Also, it is very pleasant to come away from work each day free from the aroma of latex gloves and LB bacteria broth that is redolent in many of my fellow interns.

How have you taken advantage of the educational opportunities you have had to prepare for college?\n\n-In middle school, I had fewer academic opportunities than many of my high school peers did, which left me intellectually unchallenged. While at Saint Francis, I\u0092ve fostered strong interests in Mathematics, the Sciences and French through many advanced courses, such as AP Calculus BC, AP Physics, and AP French Literature.\n\nA passion for mathematics led me to persuade the teacher of Advanced Algebra 2/Trigonometry-X to let me into his class despite my having narrowly\nmissed its prerequisites. That course opened the door for me to a succession of higher-level math and science courses \u0096 all of which I excelled at. My fascination with and devotion to mastery of the French language has led me to attain a fluent level in French, culminating in a Department Award for excellence in French 4AP.\n\nIn all of my classes, however, I\u0092ve taken advantage of more than the class material. From the intricacy of Calculus, I\u0092ve learned that shortcuts can be harmful in both math and in life. From French, I\u0092ve observed that people, worldide, are all really the same, despite linguistic or cultural barriers. Indeed, I\u0092ve taken away several important life lessons that I know will prove useful to me in college and beyond.\n\n2.) Tell us about a talent, experience, contribution, or personal quality you will bring to the Univ. of California.\n\n-I\u0092d like to consider myself an adept filmmaker as a result of experiences at the Digital Clubhouse Network. There, I participated in a nationwide project called the Veterans History Program, in which I collaborated with World War II veterans to create short digital autobiographies on their lives and experiences. Those films were then sent to the Library of Congress to be archived, thus preserving a piece of history that may otherwise have been lost forever. I spent dozens of hours meticulously synchronizing audio and video tracks on Adobe Premiere; readjusting volumes and transparencies, scouring the Internet and vast volumes of information for relevant images, and doing other tedious tasks that are crucial for the production of a fine piece of film. At the end of the process, I always looked upon my work with great pride, knowing that all those hours had been spent for a good cause. While at the University of California, I look forward to being an active member of any film clubs, perhaps founding one, taking film classes, and maybe even minoring in film. Specifically, I\u0092d like to use film as a means of showcasing students\u0092 diversity for which I should have an abundance of material as a member of a culturally rich campus community\n\n3.) Is there anything you would like us to know about you or your academic record that you have not had the opportunity to describe elsewhere in this application?\n\n-After a middle school experience that was anything but memorable, I entered high school with a crippling social anxiety. It seemed to me that everyone I saw, even complete strangers, was out to hurt me. So, my first two years of high school were rather dull. I joined some clubs, but shied away from participation outside of my \u0093comfort zone.\u0094 But, in the spring of my junior year, all that changed.\n\nSeeing the spring musical as a sophomore charmed me into participating in it as a junior. I opted to join the technical crew, as acting did not\ninterest me at that point. I remember the first day the crewmembers were called in to observe a rehearsal for the musical, 'Footloose'. As I entered the room, the sight of cast members donning costumes and vocalizing instilled in me a devastating sense of apprehension. Half an hour into the rehearsal, I wanted to quit. However, I chose to stay until the end, perhaps out of\ndetermination or maybe even out of indifference. As the rehearsal progressed, I became increasingly comfortable with my surroundings, and actually\ninitiated conversations with many of the cast. By the end of the day, I was having too much fun to quit and had chosen to stay on.\n\nI began to enjoy and look forward to rehearsals, even those that, in some cases, lasted as long as twelve hours. During these hours, I found myslf\nconversing with cast members, some of whom were complete strangers to me. As I reached out to them, they reached back, which came as a surprise\nto me. Over the course of four weeks of rehearsals and shows, I was slowly recovering from the anxiety that had posed countless problems forme.\n\nThe best examples of my transition to a more open personality are the two cast parties. The first party was a social get-together in the local park.\nAs I approached, the sight of the cast members spawned within me a paralyzing fear that led me to turn back home. However, on the way back the\nthought of how much fun I had had during rehearsals made me go back to the park. For the first half hour I was very tense, but I reminded myself that these were the same people that I saw every day at rehearsal and that I had no reason to be afraid of them. For the rest of the party, anxiety gave me no problems at all. The culmination of this transition was the second cast\nparty, in which I was actually able to go to a cast member\u0092s home, 30 miles away, and stay up all night with fellow cast members, talking, singing\nshow tunes that I had never heard of; just enjoying myself. This was all new territory for me.\n\nLooking back at those four weeks, I realize that my participation in the musical did a lot for me. It made me reflect on the way I looked at people and led me to see that it was I who was prejudging, not them. I learned to open myself to people and, as the classic Kenny Loggins song goes, \u0093cut loose.\u0094 Since my involvement in the musical, I\u0092ve been able to participate much more\nin the school community. Looking forward to life on a university campus and all it has to offer, I am determined to never let anxiety keep me from\nparticipating again. I look forward to taking part in the drama program and as many productions as possible, being in the mainstream of events, and\nparticipating in the Study Abroad program                "}, {"date": "2004-12-29T17:22:17+00:00", "url": "http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/naval-academy-annapolis/22204-pending-waiver-submission-review.html", "messages": "\n                    For those of you who have gone through the waiver process:\nI was wondering if you have any background with \u0093Pending Waiver Submission/Review\". This is my status on the DoD-MERB site and it\u0092s probably been at this state for at least two and a half weeks.  Like how long is the waiver status going to be \"pending\"? How long does it generally take for them to review medical records?\n\nMy assumptions lead me to believe that this is when there is an actual doctor or professional in the area that is reviewing the records, justifying your position, etc.  Usually DoD-MERB & the academy work efficiently together to get things straightened out quickly.  I was thinking that perhaps it\u0092s taking longer because of the holidays.  As you can imagine I am going nuts checking my status everyday, if not twice a day, because DoD-MERB refreshes/updates their site every ten minutes.  It\u0092s hard to wait out when you know that the \u0093problem\u0094 is a result of misinterpretations of remedial information. & irking to be constantly asked, \u0093How\u0092re things going as far as the Naval Academy?\u0094      \u0093\u0085Actually I might not know \u0091til April, but thanks.\u0094  Yeah\u0085it\u0092s frustrating.

Your help would be greatly appreciated. I am currently a junior and have very strong test scores, but a very low gpa. untill recently i didnt even think college was an option for me but have changed my thinking with the results of my act scores. i also took several ap tests my sophmore year via independant study. I did this because i thought it would look good on my transcript, possibly outweighing the dismal performance in my actual classes. i am a black male and from a very disadvantaged background(foster homes,drugs,health problems). i will explain that in my essays and/or interviews. will be excellent and really make me stand out. I am certain they will make any admissions officer feel pity. Also tuition is no worry as the govermental agencys i am afiliated with pay for tuition. So when evaluating take this into consideration. Also i have taken all honors and 1 AP class(AP US). my stats are as follows.\nGPA 1.7weighted1.5unweighted\nACT35\nSAT havent taken, plan to take\nAP BIO 4\nAP CHEM 5\nAP PHYSIC BC 5\nAP ENGLISH COMP 4\nAP US 5\nAP GOV 5\nAP World History 4\nJOB BEST BUY 6months(since turning 16)\nCOMMUNITY SERVICE AGENCY(i will make it out to seem that i worked there, though in actuallity i was more of a participant)4years\nSpecial skill I play alto sax,clarinet,violin,and piano.All extremly well except the piano. Expert at chess, though not on chess team. like anime\n\nThe reason for my low gpa is that i never had time to really focus on schoolwork. however i am a good test taker and(not trying to glorify myself)naturally gifted. i would read a textbooks,encyclopedias, and watch the history channel/pbs for fun whenever i had the time. i was just able to absorb information. but when it came to doing homework, i couldn't focus. in fact it is a miracle i got such good AP scores, as i never really....truly studied. I simply realized that test scores were my only chance at going to college.\nAlso i plan to retake the ACT as i have to take the writting portion of the test.Assume score remains the same. As well as a few SAT subject tests and maybe AP Calc and GOV camparative. Also I am a resident of illinois.                "}]
